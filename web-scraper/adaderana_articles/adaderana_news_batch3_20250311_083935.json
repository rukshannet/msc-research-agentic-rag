        "title": "Apple lays off more than 600 workers in California in its first major round of post-pandemic cuts",
        "date": "April 5, 2024 04:57 pm",
        "content": "Apple is laying off more than 600 workers in California, marking the companys first big wave of post-pandemic job cuts amid a broader wave of tech industry consolidation. The iPhone maker notified 614 workers in multiple offices on March 28 that they were losing their jobs, with the layoffs becoming effective on May 27, according to reports to regional authorities. The workers were cut from eight offices in Santa Clara, according to the filings under the states Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, also known as WARN. But its not clear which departments or projects the employees were involved in. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Friday. The Cupertino, California, company had been a notable exception as other tech companies slashed their workforces over the past two years. There was a massive surge in hiring during the COVID-19 pandemic, when people spent more time and money online, and big tech companies are still larger than they were before the pandemic. Still, as growth slows, companies are focusing on cutting costs to bolster their bottom lines. Amazon announced earlier this week a fresh round of layoffs, this time at its cloud computing business AWS. In recent months, video game maker Electronic Arts said its cutting about 5 of its workforce, Sony said its axing about 900 jobs in its PlayStation division, Cisco Systems revealed plans to lay off more than 4,000 workers and social media company Snap, owner of Snapchat, announced its slashing 10 of its global workforce.

        "title": "Israel admits grave mistake and sacks senior officers after Gaza bombing kills aid workers",
        "date": "April 5, 2024 05:21 pm",
        "content": "Israel has admitted its forces made a grave mistake after seven aid workers with World Central Kitchen were killed in an airstrike. The humanitarian group, which delivers food aid to war and disaster zones, said the seven were returning from coordinating an aid shipment in central Gaza when their three car convoy was struck and they were killed. Their deaths triggered a wave of international condemnation and shone a fresh spotlight on the dire conditions that Gazas besieged population is suffering from in the embattled enclave. More than 220 humanitarian workers have been killed in the conflict so far, according to the UN. Responding to the inquiry, Scott Paul, humanitarian policy lead at Oxfam, said: The World Central Kitchen attack is tragic, but its not an anomaly. The killing of aid workers in Gaza has been systemic. Israels investigation into the incident was led by Yoav Har-Even, a retired military officer, who on Friday said two military officers have been dismissed over the drone strikes on aid workers. According to the inquiry there were two main areas of wrongdoing. Firstly, the officers failed to read messages telling them that cars, and not aid trucks, would be taking the charity away from the warehouse where the food aid was stored. As a result, the cars that were targeted were misidentified as transporting members of Hamas. The army also faulted a major who identified the strike target and a colonel who approved the strike, for acting with insufficient information. The army said the order was given after one of the passengers inside a car was identified as a gunman. It said troops became suspicious because a gunman had been seen on the roof of one of the delivery trucks on the way to the warehouse. The army showed reporters footage of the gunman firing his weapon while riding on top of one of the trucks. After the aid was dropped off at a warehouse, an officer believed he had spotted a gunman in one of the cars. The passenger, it turned out, was not carrying a weapon - the military said it is possible he was just carrying a bag. The army said it initially hit one car. As people scrambled away into a second car, it hit that vehicle as well. It did the same thing when survivors scrambled into a third car. Army officials claimed that drone operators could not see that the cars were marked with the words World Central Kitchen because it was night. The army could not say exactly where the communication about the convoys plans had broken down. Har-Even said: The investigations findings indicate that the incident should not have occurred. Those who approved the strike were convinced that they were targeting armed Hamas operatives and not WCK employees. The strike on the aid vehicles is a grave mistake stemming from a serious failure due to a mistaken identification, errors in decision-making, and an attack contrary to the Standard Operating Procedures. As a consequence it has dismissed a brigade chief of staff with the rank of colonel and a brigade fire support officer with the rank of major, and issued formal reprimands to senior officers including the general at the head of the Southern Command. The WCK earlier this week indentified all those who died after the IDF struck the convoy. Saifeddin Issam Ayab Abutaha, 25, of Palestine; Lalzawmi Frankcom, 43, of Australia; Damian Sob√≥l, 35, of Poland; Jacob Flickinger, 33, a US-Canadian dual citizen; along with UK citizens John Chapman, 57, James Henderson, 33, and James Kirby, 47. The seven who were killed were distributing food that had been taken into Gaza through a newly established maritime corridor. WCK said it had co-ordinated its movements with the military, and that the vehicles were marked with the organisations logo. The food charity itself called the investigation and disciplinary actions important steps forward. However it is also clear from their preliminary investigation that the IDF has deployed deadly force without regard to its own protocols, chain of command and rules of engagement, the statement said. Without systemic change, there will be more military failures, more apologies and more grieving families. The outcome of the investigation comes just a day after US president Joe Biden warned Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that US support for Israel would be determined by its efforts to protect civilians and aid workers. Just hours after the two leaders conversed Israel agreed to reopen two border crossings into Gaza to increase the flow of humanitarian aid. Source: Independent --Agencies",

        "content": "A rare earthquake has hit New Jersey, rattling buildings in New York City and the surrounding areas. The United States Geological Survey said the magnitude-4.8 quakes epicentre was near Lebanon, New Jersey. A UN Security Council meeting on Gaza at its New York headquarters was temporarily paused due to the tremor. Is that an earthquake? said Save the Children representative Janti Soeripto, who was speaking at the time. The earthquake hit at around 10:20 local time (15:20 GMT). There are no reports of major damage. Buildings were shaken in the citys Brooklyn and the Bronx districts, rattling cupboard doors and fixtures. Charita Walcott, a 38-year-old resident in the Bronx, said the quake felt like a violent rumble that lasted about 30 seconds or so. It was kind of like being in a drum circle, that vibration, she said. I was laying in my bed, and my whole apartment building started shaking. I started freaking out, another New York resident told the BBCs US partner CBS. Fabien Levy of the New York Mayors office and New York state governor Kathy Hochul said officials were assessing the impact of the tremors. Social media users reported feeling the earthquake from Philadelphia eastward along the coast. It is not the first time the East Coast and New York City have been hit with a quake, although they are rare. Todays was the strongest since 1983, when a quake hit near the town of Newcomb in upstate New York with a 5.1 magnitude. A 5.0-magnitude-quake was measured in New York City in 1884.

        "title": "Sri Lanka settled nearly 2bn worth of foreign debt and interest, govt. says",
        "date": "April 5, 2024 11:34 pm",
        "content": "Mr. Rajith Keerthy Tennakoon, President Director General of Community Affairs says that after between President Ranil Wickremesinghes assumption of office and February 2024, the Sri Lankan government has settled a total of USD 1909.7 million in foreign debt and interest payments. He also highlighted that from 21 July 2022 to February 2024, the government has disbursed 1338.8 million in multilateral loans and interest, with no outstanding arrears in loan instalments or interest payments up to February 2024. Mr. Rajith Keerthi Tennakone conveyed this information during a special media statement today (05). Expressing his views further Mr. Thennakoon further commented: According to the Department of External Resources, payments totalling USD 760.1 million have been made to the Asian Development Bank and USD 7.0 million to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Additionally, payments of USD 22.3 million have been made to the European Investment Bank, USD 17.9 million to the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and USD 9.8 million to the EFF 23-26 program of the International Monetary Fund. Furthermore, USD 1.7 million has been disbursed to the Nordic Development Fund, USD 29.9 million to the OPEC Fund for International Development, and US 489.9 million to the World Bank. Consequently, the governments total payments for loans and interest amount to USD 1,338.8 million. It is noteworthy that the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank have extended further financial support to the government due to its commendable track record in debt repayment. During this period, negotiations are underway with relevant states and institutions to finalize agreements regarding the repayment of bilateral loans and interest, which currently stand at USD 571.0 million. Additionally, preliminary agreements have been reached concerning debt and interest payments, involving members of the Paris Club, with outstanding interest to be settled by the end of February 2024 amounting to USD 450.7 million. It is worth noting that several countries, including Japan, have provisionally agreed to resume numerous projects halted during the previous season. Moreover, bilateral loan transactions have been conducted with nearly 25 other financial institutions, such as Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, South Korea, Kuwait, Pakistan, Russia, Spain, the United States, China Development Bank, Sino-Hungarian Bank, Indian Exim Bank, and American Exim Bank. These loans and interest payments have been denominated in US Dollars, Euros, Japanese Yen, and Canadian Dollars. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has bolstered its dollar reserves in foreign currencies to facilitate local payments to institutions like Peoples Bank, Bank of Ceylon, and Hatton National Bank after settling local debt and interest obligations. Furthermore, following the repayment of multilateral, bilateral, and local dollar loans, the countrys cash reserves have surged to over USD 4.9 billion (USD 4950 mill ion). The government is actively engaged in restructuring business loans and interest totalling USD 4,439.2 million, acquired at high-interest rates. It is important to note that payment of these funds will be deferred until negotiations regarding debt restructuring are finalized. The ongoing discussion regarding the special interest rate offered for fixed deposits of senior citizens warrants attention. Introduced as a budget proposal in 2015, the special interest rate initiative aimed to provide senior citizens with a competitive interest rate of 15 per annum on their fixed deposits. Initially, the Treasury allocated funds to bridge the gap between the prevailing low interest rates in banks and the proposed higher rate of 15. This program, implemented through commercial banks, initially covered deposits up to One million rupees, which was later increased to Rs. 1.5 million in the 2018 budget. Consequently, all 1.2 million senior citizen accounts were eligible for this favourable interest rate. By 2022, the Treasury was allocating Rs. 20 billion per quarter to cover the additional interest payments. This amounted to an annual expenditure of Rs. 80,000 million (Rs. 80 billion). However, due to the countrys economic crisis, this initiative had to be halted from October 1, 2022. With over 50 of senior citizens relying on monthly interest payments, its evident that the government cannot sustain an annual expenditure of Rs. 80,000 million given the current financial situation. The outstanding amount owed to 17 banks for the additional interest payments until October 2022 stands at Rs. 108 billion. To secure the additional funds required annually, amounting to Rs. 80,000 million, a proposal suggests increasing the current value-added tax (VAT) by 1. Its imperative that any discussion of reinstating the 15 interest rate for senior citizens addresses how the necessary funds will be raised. The Central Banks policy of lowering interest rates and fostering competitive investment opportunities to stimulate economic growth should be upheld. Lessons from past instances where unsustainable interest rates led to financial instability underscore the importance of prudence in financial management to prevent such crises from recurring. --PMD",

Highlighting the progress, she noted that while 64 dengue-prone areas were identified by January, the authorities have successfully managed to mitigate risks in two zones as of today. These remarks were made by Dr. Arambepola during her participation in a press briefing at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) today (05). The Health State Minister further commented: Every year, accidents stemming from the unsafe handling of fireworks mar the festive season. Thus, a plea is made for vigilance and caution with loved ones during this New Year period. Additionally, in the preceding season, concerted efforts were made to raise awareness about dengue prevention. Gratitude is owed to health departments and media outlets for their significant contributions. Notably, compared to previous years, there has been a marked reduction in both dengue cases and fatalities. In January, there were 64 identified dengue hotspots. Presently, efforts have successfully brought under control two of these regions. Initially, over a thousand cases were reported, a number that has dwindled to 200 today. Climate conditions have undoubtedly played a role in this trajectory. From January to date, 20,365 dengue cases have been documented, with 7,289 originating from the Western Province alone. The unfortunate toll stands at only eight deaths in the year 2024. Moreover, a proactive program is currently underway to preempt potential epidemic scenarios. Its efficacy in averting such crises cannot be overstated.",

        "date": "April 6, 2024 08:55 am",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) - Global investors and Sri Lanka officials expect to hold a second round of talks aimed at restructuring 12 billion in defaulted global bonds later this month, according to people familiar with the matter. A group of bondholders, known as a steering committee, and government representatives came away from a first round of negotiations in Europe in late March without a deal. They plan to continue the discussions around the International Monetary Funds spring meetings in Washington DC, which start April 15, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private. They didnt disclose details of the proposal thats under consideration. Representatives for the central bank, treasury secretary and bondholder committee didnt respond to messages seeking comment Friday. A deal with private investors is among the last steps in Sri Lankas plan to overhaul 27 billion of foreign debt, including bonds and loans. The restructuring is critical to ensure financing from the IMF bailout keeps flowing. The government has already struck deals with official creditors, including China, India and the Paris Club as well as with holders of its local debt. Dollar bonds due in 2030, which are among the most liquid, have gained about 9 cents this year to trade around 59 cents on the dollar, according to indicative pricing compiled by Bloomberg. Government officials and global bondholders have discussed the issuance of macro-linked bonds as part of the restructuring. Those securities, which link bond payouts to the performance of Sri Lankas gross domestic product, were discussed during the first round of talks, the people said. Advisers for bondholders, led by Rothschild  Co., are holding parallel discussions with members of the Paris Club to make them aware of its proposals. Its an attempt to avoid the type of last-minute objections from the official creditors that have delayed other restructurings recently, including in Zambia, the people said. --Agencies",

        "date": "April 6, 2024 10:44 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that the renewal of knowledge stands as a pivotal task within the realm of education, underscoring the trajectory towards a knowledge-based society for the nations advancement over the next 75 years. Acknowledging the burgeoning role of modern technology and knowledge as the new pillars of education, he warned that irrespective of economic prowess, failure to synchronize with global transformations would impede progress, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. These sentiments were voiced during his participation in the 2022 annual prize-giving ceremony at Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya, Colombo, on Friday (05). The Presidents arrival at the Vidyalaya was met with enthusiastic reception from students, as the Senior Western Band, Senior Eastern Band, and Dance Team escorted him to the event, the PMD added. During the ceremony, President Wickremesinghe awarded prizes to female students who excelled across all subjects in the 2022 A-Level examination, alongside commendations for the teachers who facilitated their success and those who demonstrated exemplary attendance. Additionally, he bestowed challenge trophies upon four outstanding female students, with the prestigious Dr. Sumedha Jayaweera Challenge Trophy for the most exceptional student of 2022 awarded to Imasha Wimalaratne. Principal Dr. Sumedha Jayaweera extended a commemorative gift to the President, who reciprocated by leaving a note in the schools special guest book before departing. Expressing his views at this event, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said; I am delighted to have had the opportunity to contribute to the advancement of Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya during my tenure as the Minister of Education. The tangible outcomes of our efforts are evident today. Amidst personal challenges, I resided close to this institution. Over the past two years, we have systematically propelled the country forward, safeguarding it from regression. However, our work is far from complete. We must sustain this momentum for another 5 to 10 years. Furthermore, we must prioritize the future of our nations children. As you all prepare to integrate into an evolving society, it is the governments duty to equip you for the journey ahead. Todays youth are fortunate to have access to modern tools such as mobile phones and laptops, which serve as potent educational assets. Our nations development is paramount. Over the next 10-15 years, we must foster a robust economy in collaboration with the global community. This necessitates comprehensive modernization across all sectors, underpinned by knowledge and technology. Concepts like Smart Agriculture and blockchain technology underscore the importance of acquiring relevant expertise. In the contemporary landscape, there exists a significant power struggle between governments and online entities. Traditional methods of control are rendered ineffective by the advent of online platforms. Consequently, new legislative measures are imperative to address issues like online misconduct. In this rapidly evolving world, continuous learning is essential for progress. Without embracing new knowledge, advancement becomes unattainable. Thus, the primary objective of education must be the continual renewal of knowledge. To this end, the government is committed to revamping the education system. Plans are underway to establish education boards in every province, ensuring equitable access to resources. Moreover, both teachers and students must receive training in English language proficiency and information technology, alongside the provision of necessary equipment. Presently, the global landscape is poised to embrace the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. It is imperative that we equip ourselves with this knowledge to remain at the forefront of technological advancement. As such, we have devised plans to integrate AI technology into the school curriculum. This strategic move not only ensures our competitiveness but also positions us to surpass India in AI development, for which new legislative frameworks are being formulated. Moreover, our vision encompasses the establishment of the Green University as a fully-fledged institution, thereby enriching our countrys educational landscape. Additionally, during my official visit to India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged to provide a campus of Chennai IIT to our nation. Furthermore, funds have been allocated to establish three technical universities in Kurunegala, Seethawaka, and another area, facilitating the dissemination of technical expertise to our youth. Furthermore, the transformation of the SLIIT campus into a university underscores the imperative to revamp our university system. This restructuring is essential to cultivate the skilled workforce needed to drive progress. Plans are also underway to initiate new engineering faculties across all universities, alongside the establishment of faculties of physics and medicine. Recognizing the exodus of doctors from the country, efforts are underway to expand medical faculties to accommodate more students and address this shortage. The trajectory of our nations progress over the next 75 years hinges on the revitalization of our education system. Without this fundamental transformation, economic growth alone will prove insufficient to propel us forward in the global arena. Notable figures including Education Minister Dr. Susil Premajayantha, National School Director Hashini Talagala, Colombo Regional Education Director P. R. Devabandhu, Deputy Principals Anupa Piyathilaka and Venuka Galappatti, Founding Principal of Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya Wimala Liyanage, former Principals R.M. A.

        "content": "The Statue of Liberty was struck by lightening on Wednesday and less than 48 hours later, the famous New York City structure survived a 4.8 magnitude earthquake. Social media users posted videos of the centuries old copper structure shaking as a quake sent tremors across the area. Live cams across NYC, including the one atop the Statue of Liberty, captured Fridays earthquake and its aftershocks in real time. The initial quakes epicenter was reported in Lebanon in New Jersey, about 50 miles west of Manhattan. New York City, Philadelphia and Boston felt the tremors around 10:23 AM local time, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) noted. While videos from across New York City showed shaking, a camera from the Statue of Libertys torch covered the earthquake. Several aftershocks were recorded after the 4.8 magnitude earthquake, most notable one centered in Gladstone, New Jersey at about 6 PM local time. New York Governor Kathy Hochul had warned about aftershocks. If there is an aftershock, people are encouraged to drop and cover and to hold, drop to the floor, cover your neck, and hold onto something that is sturdy, CNN quoted her as saying. On Wednesday, the Statue of Libertys torch was struck by lightening. It was after a severe storm hit New York City, bringing strong winds, heavy rain and flashes of lightening. The visual was captured by photographer Dan Martland. Responding to a social media users question on how long he waited to click the picture, the photographer explained: I usually track the weather with apps and head out if its looking good. Ive had times where Ive been out for eight hours and got nothing. Today was only an hour. The storm passed pretty quick. And the apps showed that there was no more cells coming my way.

        "content": "Officials of Indias Directorate Revenue Intelligence (DRI) have seized 4.9 kilograms of foreign-origin gold, mid sea near the Vedhalai coast, Mandapam in Ramanathapuram district. The operation was conducted jointly with the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) and Customs Preventive Unit (CPU), Ramanathapuram, as per a press release. Following specific intelligence that foreign-origin gold was being smuggled into India from Sri Lanka through the Vedhalai coast by a gang using a fishing boat, surveillance was stepped up along coastal pockets. The movement of suspected fishing boats was closely monitored from April 3, and in the early hours of April 4, 2024, officers identified a boat mid-sea and pursued it in an ICG vessel. As they were getting closer, the team saw that a consignment was thrown into the sea by one of the persons on board the suspected boat. In the meantime, officers of CPU Ramanathapuram also joined the operation, and the location of the consignment at sea was secured, and a search operation commenced. On the afternoon of April 5, the smuggled gold was retrieved after an extensive search operation of the sea bed. There were three persons onboard the suspected country boat and during an interrogation, they admitted that the consignment thrown into the sea consisted of foreign-origin gold smuggled from Sri Lanka, and it had been received by them, at sea, from a boat from Sri Lanka. The consignment was found to contain crude gold bars of different sizes, weighing 4.9 kg and valued at around 3.43 crores. It had been tightly packed in a towel. DRI officers said that all the three persons have been apprehended and are being interrogated. Source: The Hindu --Agencies",

        "date": "April 6, 2024 07:24 pm",
        "content": "The United States, Japan, Australia and the Philippines will hold their first joint naval exercises, including anti-submarine warfare training, in a show of force Sunday in the South China Sea where Beijings aggressive actions to assert its territorial claims have caused alarm. The four treaty allies and security partners are holding the exercises to safeguard the rule of law that is the foundation for a peaceful and stable Indo-Pacific region and uphold freedom of navigation and overflight, they said in a joint statement issued by their defense chiefs Saturday. China was not mentioned by name in the statement, but the four countries reaffirmed their stance that a 2016 international arbitration ruling, which invalidated Chinas expansive claims on historical grounds, was final and legally binding. China has refused to participate in the arbitration, rejected the ruling and continues to defy it. The Philippines brought its disputes with China to international arbitration in 2013 after a tense sea standoff. There was no immediate comment by China. Last year, the Chinese Foreign Ministry warned against military exercises involving the United States and its allies in the disputed waters harming its security and territorial interests. We stand with all nations in safeguarding the international order based on the rule of law that is the foundation for a peaceful and stable Indo-Pacific region, the four nations said but did not provide specific details of the military drills, called the Maritime Cooperative Activity. Japan said in a statement, issued by its embassy in Manila, that it would deploy its destroyer, the JS Akebono, for the South China Sea exercises, which would include anti-submarine warfare training and other military maneuvers. Japan believes that the issue concerning the South China Sea is directly related to the peace and stability of the region and is a legitimate concern of the international community including Japan, Australia, the Philippines, and the United States, Japans Defense Minister Minoru Kihara said in the statement. Japan opposes any unilateral changes to the status quo by force, such attempts as well as any actions that increase tensions in the South China Sea, he said. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a separate statement the exercises underscore our shared commitment to ensuring that all countries are free to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said respect for national sovereignty and agreed rules and norms based on international law underpin the stability of our region. Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. said the military drills on Sunday would be the first in a series of activities to build the Philippines capacity for individual and collective self-defense. Aside from China and the Philippines, the long-simmering disputes in the South China Sea, a key global trade route, also involve Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. But skirmishes between Beijing and Manila have particularly flared since last year. Washington lays no claims to the strategic seaway but has repeatedly warned that its obligated to defend its longtime treaty ally the Philippines if Filipino forces, ships and aircraft come under an armed attack, including in the South China Sea. China has warned the U.S. not to intervene in the disputes, which have sparked fears of an escalation into a major conflict that could involve the two world powers. Japan has separate territorial disputes with China over East China Sea islands. Increasing tensions in the disputed waters would be high on the agenda when President Joe Biden hosts his Japanese and Philippine counterparts in a summit at the White House next week. In the latest hostilities last month, the Chinese coast guard used water cannons that injured a Filipino admiral and four of his navy personnel and heavily damaged their wooden supply boat near the Second Thomas Shoal. The cannon blast was so strong it threw a crewman off the floor but he hit a wall instead of plunging into the sea, Philippine military officials said. The Philippine government summoned a Chinese embassy diplomat in Manila to convey its strongest protest against China. Beijing accused the Philippine vessels of intruding into Chinese territorial waters, warning Manila not to play with fire and saying China would continue to take actions to defend its sovereignty.

        "content": "Sri Lankans will have the opportunity to witness a rare celestial spectacle of the Devils Comet, scientifically named 12PPons-Brooks, which passes by the Earth once in 71 years. The Devils Comet will be positioned near the Jupiter, making it visible to the naked eye during the total solar eclipse on April 08. A rare and massive comet, known for its horned shape and has a 71-year orbit, was observed for the first time in 1300 Anno Domini by a group of Chinese astronomers. However, it was officially recognized after it was observed by the French astronomer Jean-Louis Pons in the 19th century and rediscovered by British American astronomer William Brooks in 1883. The comet was then officially named as 12PPons-Brooks comet. The massive comet is also known as the devil comet due to its formation of two horns made up of ice and gas and periodic explosions. According to NASA, the 18.6-mile-wide Devils Comet is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun and shine the brightest on the 21st of April. NASA further added that the Devils Comet would be located below the moon on the 10th of April, making it visible to the naked eye. Additionally, in the abrupt absence of sunlight during the total solar eclipse, skywatchers will have a view of the vast sky, dark enough to observe stars, planets and perhaps the Pons-Brooks comet as it travels through the solar system. This is the fourth time the Devils Comet appeared since its official discovery in 1812.",

        "title": "Peter Pellegrini: Russia-friendly populist elected Slovak president",
        "date": "April 7, 2024 12:47 pm",
        "content": "Populist Peter Pellegrini has been elected president of Slovakia, succeeding the liberal Zuzana Caputova. Mr Pellegrini, 48, defeated the pro-Western Ivan Korcok, a former diplomat, with 53 of the vote. A former prime minister, he is an ally of Prime Minister Robert Fico, and shares the PMs dovish attitude towards Russia. Mr Fico and his allies now control Slovakias parliament, government and soon the presidents office. Slovakia had been one of Ukraines staunchest allies before Mr Fico came to power in October on a pledge to halt supplies of Slovak Army military stocks to Kyiv. With Mr Pellegrini replacing Mrs Caputova, Ukraine has now definitively lost a voice of support in an EU and Nato capital. Mr Fico has called for an end to Western military support for Ukraine, an immediate ceasefire and peace talks with Moscow. Mr Fico said recently President Vladimir Putin had been unfairly demonised and argued admitting Ukraine to Nato would mark the beginning of a third world war. Mr Pellegrinis campaign echoed some of that Moscow-friendly rhetoric, accusing Mr Korcok of being a warmonger who would send Slovak soldiers to fight in Ukraine - a constitutional power the president does not have. Once Mrs Caputova steps down in June, there will no longer be any high-level official in Slovakia - a country which barely a year ago donated its entire fleet of MiG-29 aircraft to Ukraine - who unequivocally backs Kyivs effort to defend its territory with force. The liberal pro-Western opposition also accuses Mr Pellegrini - as head of the coalition Hlas party and chairman of parliament - of remaining silent as Mr Fico took a wrecking ball to Slovakias criminal justice system, notably abolishing the Special Prosecutors Office, which was set up 20 years ago to investigate serious corruption and economic crime. It had tried a number of senior officials in Mr Ficos Smer party, and had been overseeing the prosecution of those believed to be responsible for the murder of investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his fianc√©e Martina Kusnirova in 2018. The killings were a seismic event in Slovak politics. The fallout ended Mr Ficos second premiership in 2018 and led to the liberal, pro-Western Zuzana Caputova being elected president on a wave of popular anger at official corruption and organised crime. Robert Ficos government recently set its sights on Slovakias public broadcaster, submitting plans to abolish the institution and replace it with one under virtual state control. Those plans were put on the back burner after a surprisingly poor showing from Peter Pellegrini in the first round of the presidential election two weeks ago. The opposition fears a reinvigorated Robert Fico will resubmit them - and they say President-elect Pellegrini is unlikely to stand in his way. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lankas debt repayments to be suspended until 2028",
        "date": "April 7, 2024 01:34 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka and a group of its creditors are in final negotiations to suspend debt repayments until 2028, Nikkei has learned, as country creditors including Japan seek to prevent Chinas influence from expanding in the debt-ridden island. Negotiations with the creditor nations have concluded. We are hoping that it a detailed announcement will take place in the next few weeks, Sagala Ratnayaka, Sri Lankas national security adviser to the president, told Nikkei in a recent interview. The repayment period will be 15 years, from 2028 to 2042, with the interest rate newly set at around 2. He said that there will be no further debt reduction, despite a request by the island nation. Sri Lanka in April 2022 announced a temporary suspension of public external debt payments, in effect putting the country into default. A meeting of creditor nations was set up in April 2023. Japan, which is the largest creditor country after China, is serving as the chair in the talks along with India and France. Sri Lanka and the creditor nations have reached a basic agreement on a repayment moratorium and a reduction in interest. The provision of financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund, which was conditional on debt restructuring agreements being struck with major creditor countries, has also begun. China, the biggest creditor, has only joined the meeting as an observer. However, the restructuring of debt from China via loans of the Export-Import Bank of China would be similar, Ratnayaka said. We have a saying which means everyone will be treated equally, implying that the terms of debt repayment to China would be similar to those agreed at the creditors meeting. As of the end of 2023, Sri Lankas outstanding debt was 37.3 billion, of which China accounted for 4.7 billion. Sri Lanka handed over control of its southern Hambantota Port to China in 2017. This was seen as a typical example of a debt trap, where infrastructure rights are taken away amid delayed debt repayments. Some creditors, including Japan and India, are wary of China expanding its influence into the Indo-Pacific, with Sri Lanka as its base. Ratnayaka explained that this is all purely commercial. There is nothing military about the port agreement. Sri Lanka is open to investment and we dont pick and choose on the basis of what country, unless it affects national security. He added, But in the north and areas which would affect the security of India, we are conscious. Source: Nikkei Asia --Agencies",

The committee will comprise representatives from relevant institutions such as the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and the University of Visual and Performing Arts. President Wickremesinghe emphasized the importance of including a representative of traditional Kandyan dancers in this committee to ensure their voices are heard and their interests represented, it added. Additionally, the President instructed Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment, Manusha Nanayakkara, to explore the possibility of providing pensions to traditional Kandyan dancers as a gesture of recognition for their invaluable contribution to the cultural heritage of Sri Lanka. Acknowledging the popularity of Kandyan dance both locally and internationally, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the need to address issues related to the preservation of traditional practices and rituals associated with this art form. The newly formed committee will be tasked with providing recommendations on how to effectively safeguard and promote Kandyan dance for future generations. Furthermore, the President underscored the significance of preserving other traditional arts of the country, such as the Sabaragamuwa dance, and instructed officials to address the challenges faced by traditional dancers in Kandy, ensuring they receive the necessary support and recognition. In expressing their gratitude for President Wickremesinghes initiatives aimed at fostering economic growth and creating a better country for all citizens, traditional dancers in Kandy commended the efforts undertaken to preserve and promote Sri Lankas cultural heritage.

        "date": "April 7, 2024 05:00 pm",
        "content": "The credibility of the Narendra Modi governments neighbourhood first policy is evident as India is now planning to supply thousands of metric tons of onion to Sri Lanka after supplying vast quantities of essential commodities to Maldives under the pro-China Mohammed Muizzu regime, Indian Media reported today. It is understood that besides this, India on April 3 allowed a supply of additional 10,000 tons of onions over and above its quota to close ally United Arab Emirates (UAE) as the Gulf country is always a priority with Bharat. Despite the fact that India could have twisted Muizzu on the eve of crucial Majlis elections on April 21, the last paragraph of the export notification to Maldives that export of all essential items will be exempted from any existing restriction prohibition on exports. This means that India will continue to supply essential commodities to Maldives even if there is any export ban and restriction imposed by India due to unforeseen shortfall in production in nearor distant future. Fact is that Muizzus mission to Turkey, China and UAE to garner funds have turned out to be a cropper as none of the countries have pledged any grants to the Indian Ocean littoral state. Thanks to short sightedness of Muizzu, Saudi Arabia is just not interested in Maldives after the Maldivian Salafi leader went to Turkey as his first foreign visit after he was sworn as Maldivian President on November 17, 2023. Muizzu has still not visited India as he came to power riding on an anti-India campaign. The Indian decision to export essential commodities was not based on politics but a reach to the Maldivian public and to also give a signal that Bharat is with Maldives whosoever be the ruler of the tiny island nation. The Maldivian economy is right now as well as no infrastructure projects have been revived by Muizzu after he came to power and the country owes some USD one billion as debt repayment on account of sovereign bonds in 2026. Male owes USD 50 million as interest to SBI in May and another USD 50 million in September on account of treasury bills purchased by the Indian multinational bank. Thanks to toxic anti-India policies pursued by Maldives ruler Muizzu, the high spending Indian tourist arrivals in Male have plunged with the island nation swamped by low-spending Chinese tourists. Even though there is no threat to Muizzus government whatever the results of Majlis elections, the Modi government is keen to ensure that the Maldivian public does to suffer on account of policies of its erratic ruler.

        "date": "April 7, 2024 05:18 pm",
        "content": "Its 50 years since ABBA won a major battle with Waterloo. A half-century ago on Saturday, the Swedish quartet triumphed at the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest with the peppy love song, which opens: My my, at Waterloo, Napoleon did surrender, and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way. The song rang out again Saturday at Londons Waterloo railway station - also named after the 1815 battle that dealt defeat to the French leader - where a choir belted out a rendition for commuters. In the English coastal town of Brighton, where the 1974 competition was held, fans were staging a flashmob dance and silent ABBA disco to mark the anniversary. Eurovision victory turned ABBA into a pop juggernaut, by far the most successful band to win the pan-continental music contest, which will hold its 68th edition in May in ABBAs home country, Sweden. The Eurovision final will take place May 11 in Malm√É, after Swedish singer Loreen won last years competition with Tattoo. ABBAs melodic disco pop sold hundreds of millions of records worldwide. The stage musical Mamma Mia! based on its songs is 25 years old and spawned two movies. The band members have not performed together live for four decades, but released a comeback album, Voyage, in 2021. Every day, fans attend a concert by digital ABBA-tars at the hit show Abba Voyage, which opened in London in 2022. In a thank-you message to fans on Saturday, the four band members said it was slightly dizzying and deeply humbling to know that their songs had been passed down the generations and still resonate around the world. Music you discover and learn to love when you grow up or even later in life has a way of staying with you forever, said Agnetha Faltskog, Bj√Érn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. We share that experience with you and to know that our music has become a constant in your lives is a wonderful thing. A tribute concert titled A party for ABBA was set to take place in Stockholm on Saturday evening featuring prominent Swedish artists, a 21-person band and a large choir. Organizers said it was a salute to a band that changed the Nordic countrys music scene forever. Swedish public broadcaster SVT, which planned to broadcast the concert live on television and on its streaming service, said April 6, 1974 is considered by some to be Swedens national music day.

        "date": "April 7, 2024 09:54 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that the present Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) lacks the policies of the United National Party (UNP), with its economic strategy now being overseen by individuals who was expurgated by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). Additionally, President Wickremesinghe highlighted that the SJB, once poised to take control of Sirikotha in 2020 under the UNP banner, has now been influenced by the chairman of the SLPP and other factions. These remarks were made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe during a meeting of political party representatives convened at the Presidents House in Kandy today (07). He noted that the political landscape underwent significant changes following the political turmoil in July 2022, stressing the importance of all parties, regardless of affiliation, to prioritize the nations interests and collaborate with the governments agenda for progress. Addressing the gathering President Ranil Wickremesinghe commented on the political landscape, noting that the upheaval in July 2022, stemming from the economic crisis, led to a transformation in the countrys party system. He emphasized the collective effort in achieving economic stability today and underscored the shared responsibility of safeguarding and advancing this progress. Addressing the legislative aspect, President Wickremesinghe highlighted instances where laws passed by Parliament in the last two years have not been fully implemented during their parliamentary term. Despite economic challenges, initiatives like the Aswesuma program aimed at supporting low-income individuals were launched, with efforts to triple the available allowance. Additionally, the Urumaya program, focused on providing freehold deeds to two million people, was initiated. The President emphasized that these programs represent on-going efforts, initiated during a period of economic prosperity, which are now being pursued to address current challenges. The President highlighted that the majority of Parliament has backed the continuation of government programs, with support coming from factions of the SLPP, UNP and SLFP, along with members from other parties. Stressing the importance of unity and coordination, the President emphasized that regardless of party affiliation, the primary decision lies in whether to advance with the governments program or not. President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed his views on recent political developments, noting a division within political parties where the Chairman of the SLPP and a minority faction transitioned to the opposition, subsequently gaining control of the SJB. He highlighted that despite SJBs previous claim of being the UNP in 2020, the current leadership of SJB comprises individuals who exited the SLPP. President Wickremesinghe asserted that the true essence of the UNP is no longer present within the SJB, emphasizing his longstanding commitment to the UNP and his collaborative efforts with past leaders such as J.R. Jayewardene, R. Premadasa, and D.B. Wijetunga. He underscored the need for political unity, stressing the landscape of politics has evolved, requiring cooperation with both the SLPP and SLFP for the betterment of the country. Encouraging grassroots engagement, President Wickremesinghe urged individuals to connect with their communities. He highlighted the progress made with the Urumaya initiative, with one million out of two million freehold deeds already completed. Expressing confidence in the ability to expedite the distribution process, he called for unified support from the Kandy district in advancing the governments agenda through effective coordination. In the meantime, President Ranil Wickremesinghe attended a gathering of Local Government Chairmen from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), orchestrated by the Local Government Members Forum of the SLPP. The meeting, held at the Presidents House in Kandy today (07), served as a platform for the SLPP members to reaffirm their support for the President. Addressing the gathering, President Wickremesinghe announced plans to establish an advisory organization comprising former local government Chairmen. This organization will serve to facilitate communication between the government and rural communities, disseminating information about initiatives aimed at bolstering the countrys economy. Furthermore, President Wickremesinghe outlined the implementation of a mechanism to directly relay village-specific issues to both the President and the Prime Minister. This initiative aims to streamline the feedback process, ensuring timely and effective resolution of local concerns. The President encouraged former local government Chairmen to actively participate in the on-going government programs such as the Aswesuma initiative and the Urumaya land deed program, assuring them of necessary support and facilities. Additionally, he emphasized the importance of involving youth from local government areas as pioneers in executing government initiatives. These meetings were attended by Minister Manusha Nanayakkara, Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, as well as the General Secretary of the UNP Palitha Range Bandara. --PMD--",

        "title": "Israel reduces troops in south Gaza, Egypt to host new talks",
        "date": "April 7, 2024 10:17 pm",
        "content": "Israel said on Sunday it had withdrawn more soldiers from southern Gaza, leaving just one brigade, as it and Hamas sent teams to Egypt for fresh talks over a potential ceasefire in the six-month conflict. Israel has been reducing numbers in Gaza since the start of the year to relieve reservists and is under growing pressure from its ally Washington to improve the humanitarian situation, especially after last weeks killing of seven aid workers. The military spokesperson did not give details on reasons for withdrawing soldiers or numbers involved. Both Israel and Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls Gaza, confirmed they were sending delegations to Egypt. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Israel would not bend to foreign pressure and give in to extreme demands. A Hamas leader, Basem Naim, blamed him. Netanyahu is still stalling to save himself from failure and the responsibility for the day after the battle. It seems that the U.S. pressure is not enough to compel him to go for a complete and comprehensive ceasefire, said Naim. Hamas says an agreement must secure a complete and comprehensive ceasefire, full withdrawal of forces from areas occupied after Oct. 7, and freedom of movement of residents across the Gaza Strip. More than 250 hostages were seized and some 1,200 people killed during Hamas Oct. 7 attack, according to Israeli tallies. More than 33,100 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli offensive, according to the health ministry in Gaza. It was unclear whether the troop reduction in south Gaza would delay a long-threatened incursion into the city of Rafah, which Netanyahu says is needed to eliminate Hamas but anxious foreign powers have said could wreak an unacceptable toll on civilians. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said the troop reduction appeared to be a rest and refit and not necessarily indicative of any new operations. Palestinian residents of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, which has come under Israeli bombardment in recent months, said they had seen Israeli forces leaving the centre of the city and retreating to the eastern districts. PALESTINIAN HOPES It seems at the end it may be a happy Eid, said Imad Joudat, 55, who lives with his eight-member family in a tent in Rafah, referring to the coming Muslim Eid al-Fitr holiday that starts mid-week. The occupation withdrew forces from Khan Younis, the Americans are pressuring after some foreigners were killed and Egypt is holding a big round with the Americans, the Israelis, Hamas and Qatar. This time we are hopeful, Joudat told Reuters via a chat app. Rafah near the border with Egypt has become the last refuge for more than a million Palestinians. Six months of combat have strained the Israeli military and economy. Many Israeli security experts say they now see a greater threat from Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel is also on alert for a possible retaliatory attack from Iran in reaction to the killing of Iranian generals on April 1. Israel is under increased pressure from the United States, where President Joe Biden has demanded that it improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza and work towards a ceasefire, saying that U.S. support could depend on that. That was the first time Biden, a staunch supporter of Israel, has sought to leverage U.S. aid as a way to influence Israeli military behaviour. The U.S. is a major supplier of arms to Israels military. Biden has also urged the leaders of Egypt and Qatar to pressure Hamas to agree to a ceasefire and hostage deal ahead of a fresh round of talks in Cairo. Netanyahu, at the start of his weekly cabinet meeting, said any deal must include the release of hostages still being held in Gaza, and that Hamas unreasonable demands were the obstacle. Giving in to Hamas demands will allow it to repeat the crimes of Oct. 7 again and again, as it has promised to do, he said. More than 130 hostages are still in captivity in Gaza, and Israel says it will not stop its offensive until they are all returned. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "More than 90 people have died after a boat capsized off Mozambiques northern coast, authorities say. Those aboard the boat were fleeing a cholera outbreak and were travelling from Lunga to Mozambique Island, off the coast of Nampula, local media reported. The fishing boat could accommodate a maximum of 100 people, however there were around 130 people on board, a representative of the island administration told the STV television station. Because the boat was overcrowded and unsuited to carry passengers it ended up sinking ... There are 91 people who lost their lives, said Nampulas secretary of state Jaime Neto. The AIM news agency, citing a representative of the maritime authority, reported that the ship was probably wrecked when it was hit by high waves. Rescuers had found five survivors and were searching for more, but sea conditions were making the operation difficult. Mozambique is currently affected by the largest cholera outbreak of the last 25 years, according to UNs childrens relief organisation UNICEF. Since the outbreak began in September 2022, more than 37,000 cases have been reported. Mozambique, which has a long Indian Ocean coastline and borders South Africa, Eswatini, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi and Tanzania, was a Portuguese colony until independence in 1975. --Agencies",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced that a new committee would be established to coordinate arrangements for the last rites of individuals in accordance with their religious customs or final wishes, including those within the Muslim community. He also expressed his commitment to enacting relevant legislation in the future. These remarks were made during his attendance at the Ifthar ceremony held yesterday (07) at the Jumma Mosque in Katukele, Kandy. President Wickremesinghe, addressing the event further added; Amidst the economic challenges faced by the nation last season, long queues became a common sight, disrupting even the observance of Ramadan fasts. However, with improvements in the economy over the past year, today presents us with the opportunity to observe Ramadan and its fasting rituals as usual. During Ramadan, the Muslim community abstains from food and drink, focusing on the virtues of fasting and nurturing moral values. Its noteworthy that Ramadan coincides with the Sinhala New Year, reflecting a culture of inclusivity transcending racial and religious barriers throughout our history. Efforts are also underway to regulate Madrasa schools under the Ministry of Education, mirroring the oversight of private education. In 2019, steps were taken to address obstacles related to Muslim literature. The recent pandemic posed challenges for the Muslim community in conducting proper last rites, causing immense distress. To address this, future legislation will enable individuals to carry out their last rites in accordance with their religious beliefs or final wishes, ensuring everyones right to burial or cremation. We are committed to formulating the necessary regulations to honour individuals preferences in this regard. As Sri Lanka observes Ramadan today, a sombre situation unfolds in the Gaza Strip, where the Muslim community mourns the loss of approximately thirty-five lives. In light of this tragedy, we have decided to forego the national Ramadan festival this year and allocate the funds to support the people of Gaza. Additionally, a commitment has been made to construct a school in Gaza once the conflict subsides. Our stance remains firm in opposing the dissolution of the Palestinian state, and we stand in solidarity to end the ongoing conflict. Contributions totalling Rs. 10 million from Kattankudy Mosque, Rs. 2.2 million from Katukele Jumma Mosque, and Rs. 3.5 million from Muslim foreign employment agencies have been handed over to President Ranil Wickremesinghe for distribution among the affected Muslim community. The event was attended by Chief Moulavi Syed Maulana of the Jumma Mosque in Katukele, Kandy, Minister Manusha Nanayakkara, State Ministers Lohan Ratwatte, Anuradha Jayaratne, Dilum Amunugama, as well as the Presidents Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, among others. --PMD",

        "title": "New Zealand tightens visa rules due to unsustainable migration",
        "date": "April 8, 2024 04:03 pm",
        "content": "New Zealand has tightened work visa rules in response to unsustainable migration levels, say authorities. Low-skilled applicants now have to fulfil English-language requirements and are allowed to stay on for three years - down from five previously. Getting our immigration settings right is critical to this governments plan to rebuild the economy, said Immigration Minister Erica Stanford. A near-record 173,000 people migrated to New Zealand last year. Under the tightened rules, applicants for most work visas now have to fulfill requirements for skills and work experience. Employers are responsible for ensuring that migrants meet the specified requirements before offering them a job. Authorities have also decided to axe earlier plans to add 11 roles, such as welders, fitters and turners, to the list of occupations that would qualify for a fast track to residency. These rules mark the start of a more comprehensive work programme to create a smarter immigration system, Ms Stanford said, adding that more stringent visa rules also help prevent the exploitation of migrant workers. New Zealand, which has a population of 5.3 million, has been experiencing a surge in migration since end 2022. The government is focused on attracting and retaining the highly skilled migrants such as secondary teachers, where there is a skill shortage. At the same time we need to ensure that New Zealanders are put to the front of the line for jobs where there are no skills shortages, Ms Stanford said. New Zealands Prime Minister Christopher Luxon had said last year that the countrys high net migration rates did not feel sustainable at all. New Zealands immigration system had been closed at a time when employers were looking for workers during the pandemic... and then Labour opened the floodgates just as the economy was starting to slow, Mr Luxon, who leads the conservative National Party, told Radio New Zealand in December. Were inheriting a system thats been a complete hash, he had said. Some policymakers have warned that the new arrivals may further drive up rents and house prices. On Monday, New Zealands Employers and Manufacturers Association raised concerns that the new visa rules could have unintended consequences. We are supportive of ensuring we are bringing in the right workers, and that they are not exploited, but we do need to make sure we get the balance right, said Alan McDonald, the associations Head of Advocacy. Making it harder for motivated workers to come into New Zealand means they will go somewhere else, that hurts business and means our economy misses out, he said. At the same time, New Zealanders have been moving out of the country - often to its more prosperous neighbour, Australia. Last year, for example, New Zealand saw a record loss of 47,000 citizens. Australia, which has also seen an influx of immigrants, announced in December that it will halve its migration intake by tightening visa rules for international students and low-skilled workers. The Australian government has been under pressure from some quarters to temporarily reduce migration to help ease Australias housing crisis and infrastructure woes. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "April 8, 2024 09:21 pm",
        "content": "Indonesia is seeking to sign its trade pact with Sri Lanka by next March while hoping that one year of negotiations is enough to close the deal. It has only been a few weeks since Indonesia and Sri Lanka agreed to formally discuss the preferential trade agreement (PTA). The first round of negotiations already took place virtually earlier this week, which zeroed in on the work plan and draft agreement text. The negotiators are set to enter more substantial chapters in the coming rounds. Indonesia and Sri Lanka are  aiming to substantially conclude the negotiations by end-2024. We have also set a target to sign the agreement in March 2025, a press statement by the Trade Ministry reads. The second round of talks is scheduled to take place in Colombo on June 19-20. Both countries will discuss the text concept, as well as market access. During the negotiations launching ceremony last month, Deputy Trade Minister Jerry Sambuaga said the PTA would become a building block to a free trade agreement (FTA). Unlike the PTA whose scope is still limited, an FTA is more ambitious in nature and usually aims to remove the tariffs across all or most goods. Jakarta also said at the time that the upcoming PTA could help Indonesian goods such as palm oil, paper, and fatty acid to gain better access to the Sri Lankan market. Indonesia-Sri Lanka trade was valued at 369.7 million throughout 2023. About 326.6 million of the trade figures were Indonesian exports to Sri Lanka. In January 2024 alone, the bilateral trade amounted to 23.5 million. Indonesia mainly exports copra, petroleum, paper, cartons, tobacco, as well as coal to Sri Lanka. Knitted fabrics and tobacco processing machines were among Indonesias top imports from the South Asian country, according to the Trade Ministry. Source: Jakarta Globe --Agencies",

        "title": "Hamas says Gaza truce talks still deadlocked despite reports of progress",
        "date": "April 8, 2024 10:39 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - A Hamas official said on Monday no progress had been made at a new round of talks in Cairo on a ceasefire in the Gaza war after the Egyptian hosts said headway had been achieved on the agenda. Israel and Hamas sent teams to Egypt on Sunday after the arrival on Saturday of CIA Director William Burns, whose presence underlined rising U.S. pressure for a deal that would free Israeli hostages held in Gaza and get aid to Palestinian civilians. Qatari representatives also attended. There is no change in the position of the occupation (Israel) and therefore, there is nothing new in the Cairo talks, the Hamas official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. There is no progress yet. Western powers have voiced concern over the high Palestinian civilian death toll and the humanitarian crisis arising from Israels military onslaught to destroy Hamas in the densely populated Gaza Strip. Some 33,207 Palestinians have been killed in six months of conflict, Gazas health ministry said in an update on Monday. Most of the enclaves 2.3 million people are homeless and many at risk of famine. Hamas killed 1,200 people in southern Israel in the cross-border attack on Oct. 7 that triggered the conflict, according to Israeli tallies. The Israeli army says over 600 of its soldiers have been killed in combat since. On Monday, a day after Israeli forces pulled back from some areas in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, Palestinian medical officials said their teams had recovered more than 60 bodies from areas where the soldiers operated in the past months. Hundreds of residents who had fled and been living in tents in the city of Rafah - where more than one million people were sheltering - returned to their devastated home areas. Some rode on donkey carts, rickshaws and open-deck vehicles while some just walked. They were shocked at the destruction of buildings, roads and property they had left behind. It is a shock, a shock...the destruction is unbearable, said resident Mohammed Abou Diab. I am going to my house and I know that it is destroyed. I am going to remove the rubble to get a shirt out, he added. In Washington, a White House spokesperson said the United States was hoping to secure a hostage release deal as soon as possible since it would also lead to a ceasefire of around six weeks. Hamas is reviewing a new proposal now, John Kirby said. SOME PROGRESS? In Jerusalem at the weekend, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz described the Cairo talks as the closest the sides have come to a deal since a short-lived November truce under which Hamas freed nearly half of its hostages. Hamas seized 253 people during the Oct. 7 attack. Of those, 133 hostages remain captive and negotiators have spoken of around 40 going free in the first stage of a prospective deal with Hamas. Two Egyptian security sources and state-run Al-Qahera News said on Monday some progress had been made in the Cairo talks. The security sources said both sides had made concessions that could help pave the way for a deal for a truce which would be staggered over three stages, with the release of any remaining Israeli hostages and a long-term ceasefire addressed in the second stage. The concessions relate to the freeing of hostages and Hamas demand for the return of displaced residents to northern Gaza, they said. Mediators suggested the return could be monitored by an Arab force in the presence of Israeli security deployments that would later be pulled back, they added. Delegations left Cairo and consultations were expected to continue within 48 hours, the sources and Al-Qahera said. MAIN DEMANDS However, a Palestinian official close to mediation efforts told Reuters that deadlock continued over Israels refusal to end the war, withdraw its forces from Gaza, allow all civilians to return to their homes and lift a 17-year-old blockade to allow speedy reconstruction of the coastal enclave. These steps took precedence over Israels prime demand for a release of hostages in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Regarding the exchange of prisoners, Hamas was and is willing to be more flexible, but there is no flexibility over our...main demands, he said. Israel has ruled out ending the war shortly or withdrawing from Gaza, saying its forces will not relent until Hamas no longer controls Gaza or threatens Israel militarily. Asked about the talks by reporters on Monday, Israeli government spokesman Avi Hyman would not go into detail, saying only: The most important thing is that the right people are in the right place at the right time to discuss a way in which the 133 Israeli hostages can be released. Under global pressure to ease the humanitarian crisis and drop plans to storm Rafah, Israel said on Sunday it had withdrawn more soldiers from southern Gaza. This left just one brigade there, but Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the departing troops would be preparing for future operations, including their coming mission in the Rafah area. Rafah is the last refuge for displaced Gaza civilians from Israeli ground forces and, according to Israel, the last significant redoubt of Hamas combat units. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "April 8, 2024 10:47 pm",
        "content": "Presidential Director General (Community Affairs) Mr. Rajith Keerthi Tennakoon said that nearly Rs. 200 billion has been paid in 2023 alone to provide relief to the people affected by the economic crisis. He also mentioned that the number of relief beneficiaries as of March 31, 2024 is 1,854,308. Mr. Tennakoon mentioned this while making a special statement to the media today (08). The Presidential Director General (Community Affairs) further said: The government acknowledges its duty to alleviate the hardships faced by the populace amidst the profound economic challenges experienced in 2021 and 2022. In the singular year of 2023, a substantial sum of Rs. 184,098.27 million is deemed necessary for various aids, loans, and allowances under the Samurdhi program, catering to seniors, disabled individuals, patients with kidney disorders, and other relief needs. Additionally, the governments total expenditure on social welfare initiatives in 2023, inclusive of appeals and outstanding payments, amounts to approximately Rs.189,650.95 million (189.6 billion). In February 2024, an allocation of Rs.1,813 million was disbursed to those previously overlooked during the initial relief distribution. Furthermore, an additional disbursement of Rs. 13,697.35 million is earmarked following the review of appeals, with funds directed towards impoverished individuals. When considering the sum allocated for Samurdhi loans, the governments total outlay for social safety measures in 2023 totals Rs. 199,608.62 million, which is around Rs. 200 billion. Since President Ranil Wickremesinghe assumed the presidency in July 2022, up until December 2023 (a span of 17 months), the Samurdhi Development Department has disbursed Rs. 129.93 billion, with Rs. 65.91 billion designated for subsidies benefiting the underprivileged. Additionally, Rs. 4.52 billion were allocated for social security payments covering various life events such as births, marriages, deaths, illnesses, and scholarships. Furthermore, the Samurdhi Bank extended loans totalling Rs. 59.5 billion during this same timeframe. Furthermore, this year, the government has initiated nutritional schemes for schoolchildren, support initiatives for expectant mothers, and distributed 20 kilograms of rice free of charge to impoverished families. On International Womens Day, measures were enacted to alleviate the financial burden on women by providing loans under the Liya Saviya program, initiated by the President, at a reduced interest rate of 12. Addressing the shortcomings of previous programs such as Janasaviya and Samurdhi, the government is committed to eradicating corruption, mismanagement, and bureaucracy, while establishing a foundational social security framework. Consequently, plans are underway to introduce over 30 distinct social security initiatives nationwide, with a focus on transparency and accountability. In support of the relief efforts, the World Bank has extended a loan of  200 million, structured for repayment over 30 years, with a grace period of 5 years. It is noteworthy that by March 31, 2024, the total number of beneficiaries under the relief program is projected to reach 1,854,308. --PMD",

        "content": "Sri Lanka Womens team captain Chamari Athapaththu has cleared the air about her future in international cricket. Chamari Athapaththu has her focus entirely on the upcoming ICC Womens T20 World Cup Qualifiers, after which she will decide her future in international cricket. Athapaththu stirred up speculation within the cricketing community by dropping hints about retirement in a now-deleted Facebook post, where she mentioned last duty for my country following Sri Lankas remarkable T20I series victory over South Africa. Now, prior to the ODI series against South Africa, the 34-year-old emphasised that her primary focus lies on the upcoming commitments for Sri Lanka Im still not decided on retirement, Athapaththu said on the eve of the first ODI against the Proteas. We can talk about it later. At the moment, Im focused on the South Africa ODIs and World Cup qualifiers. Lets see in the future. Sri Lanka will have Athapaththu at the helm at least until the Qualifiers, where they will need to reach the finals to book their berth for the main tournament to be played later this year in Bangladesh. In the Qualifiers to be played in the UAE starting on 25 April, Sri Lanka are placed in Group A alongside Scotland, Thailand, Uganda and USA. The top two teams from the two groups will reach the semi-final stage. The skipper expressed confidence in her teams performance ahead of the World Cup qualifiers, highlighting the adaptability needed to succeed in the conditions UAE has to offer. Im pretty confident about my group, Athapaththu added. Weve played really good cricket so far. But the UAE has different conditions and is really good for the batters. Every team goes to qualifiers to win so we have to play our best cricket in World Cup qualifiers as well. Im pretty confident about my bowling unit and batting unit. Athapaththu has proved to be an inspirational leader for Sri Lanka and has been credited for turning them into a formidable side in recent years. This transformation has been underscored by several accolades, including a historic first-ever T20I series win over England in England, an ODI series win against New Zealand at home and most recently, T20I series win over South Africa, which was the Islanders first-ever bilateral series victory over the Proteas in any format of Womens cricket.

        "title": "UK travel advice tweaks for Sri Lanka still unfair",
        "date": "April 9, 2024 09:18 am",
        "content": "The UK government has tweaked its travel advice for Sri Lanka, but campaigners believe further changes are still required. An open letter published in January called for the Foreign, Commonwealth  Development Office (FCDO) to update its advice, describing sections as overly harsh, outdated and synthetic. The advice has now been changed slightly, with a reference to roadblocks amended. Sam Clark, chief executive of Sri Lanka specialist Experience Travel Group, said the advice is now much better and more contextualised, but still not reflective of the current situation on the ground. In February, the advice stated: Protests, demonstrations, roadblocks and violent unrest can happen anywhere across the island at short notice, and security authorities may use tear gas and water cannons against protesters. The authorities may impose restrictions, including curfews, with little or no notice. Avoid demonstrations, political protests or large gatherings. The updated advice reads: Protests and demonstrations can happen anywhere across the island at short notice, and can become violent. Security authorities may use water cannons and tear gas to control protesters. Large-scale protests in 2022 resulted in violence and loss of life. Movement around the island was difficult due to restrictions such as curfews and roadblocks. Avoid demonstrations, political protests or large gatherings. Earlier this year, Clark and his fellow campaigners expressed disappointment with the advices claim that violent unrest could happen anywhere in Sri Lanka at short notice. They were also unhappy with the appeal to UK travellers to avoid crowded places, which Clark said was particularly excessive and unfair. This week, Clark described the advice tweaks as a major win but he repeated his concerns about the claim that protests can happen anywhere in Sri Lanka at short notice. If the reality on the ground doesnt match the advice, it undermines faith in the system, said Clark. He added: We hope the FCDO continues to review their travel guidance on Sri Lanka. Nobody should deny themselves the beauties and cultural riches of this amazing country just because of a moderate risk that exists everywhere. The FCDO said: The safety of British people is the main factor when determining our travel advice. Our advice is designed to help British people make informed decisions about foreign travel and remains under constant review to ensure it reflects our latest assessment of risks when travelling abroad.

        "date": "April 9, 2024 12:14 pm",
        "content": "The world just experienced its warmest March on record, capping a 10-month streak in which every month set a new temperature record, the European Unions climate change monitoring service said on Tuesday. Each of the last 10 months ranked as the worlds hottest on record, compared with the corresponding month in previous years, the EUs Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said in a monthly bulletin. The 12 months ending with March also ranked as the planets hottest ever recorded 12-month period, C3S said. From April 2023 to March 2024, the global average temperature was 1.58 degrees Celsius above the average in the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period. Its the long-term trend with exceptional records that has us very concerned, C3S Deputy Director Samantha Burgess told Reuters. Seeing records like this - month in, month out - really shows us that our climate is changing, is changing rapidly, she added. C3S dataset goes back to 1940, which the scientists cross-checked with other data to confirm that last month was the hottest March since the pre-industrial period. Already, 2023 was the planets hottest year in global records going back to 1850. Extreme weather and exceptional temperatures have wreaked havoc this year. Climate change-driven drought in the Amazon rainforest region unleashed a record number of wildfires in Venezuela from January-March, while drought in Southern Africa has wiped out crops and left millions of people facing hunger. Marine scientists also warned last month a mass coral bleaching event is likely unfolding in the Southern Hemisphere, driven by warming waters, and could be the worst in the planets history. The primary cause of the exceptional heat were human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, C3S said. Other factors pushing up temperatures include El Nino, the weather pattern that warms the surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean. El Nino peaked in December-January and is now weakening, which may help to break the hot streak toward the end of the year. But despite El Nino easing in March, the worlds average sea surface temperature hit a record high, for any month on record, and marine air temperatures remained unusually high, C3S said. The main driver of the warming is fossil fuel emissions, said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College Londons Grantham Institute. Failure to reduce these emissions will continue to drive the warming of the planet, resulting in more intense droughts, fires, heat waves and heavy rainfall, Otto said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "International court rules Switzerland violated human rights in landmark climate case brought by 2,000 women",
        "date": "April 9, 2024 05:50 pm",
        "content": "An international court in France on Tuesday ruled Switzerlands failure to adequately tackle the climate crisis was in violation of human rights, in a landmark climate judgment that could have a ripple effect across the globe. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg, France delivered its ruling in a case brought by more than 2,000 Swiss women, the majority of whom are in their 70s, against Switzerlands government. They argued that climate change-fueled heat waves undermined their health and quality of life, and put them at risk of dying. The court ruled that the Swiss government had violated some of the womens human rights due to critical gaps in its national legislation to reduce planet-heating emissions, as well as a failure to meet past climate targets. This amounted to a breach of the womens rights to effective protection from the the serious adverse effects of climate change on lives, health, well-being and quality of life, the court said in a statement. It marks the first time the court has ruled on climate litigation. There is no right of appeal and the judgment is legally binding. Experts say the courts ruling could bolster other human rights-based climate cases pending before international courts and could open the flood gates for numerous similar lawsuits to be launched in the future. Todays rulings against Switzerland sets a historic precedent that applies to all European countries, Gerry Liston, a lawyer at Global Legal Action Network, which supported the Portugal case, said in a statement. It means that all European countries must urgently revise their targets so that they are science-based and aligned to 1.5 degrees. This is a massive win for all generations. The ruling could also force Switzerland to reduce its consumption of fossil fuels more rapidly. Fossil fuels are the main driver of human-caused climate change. Vesselina Newman, from the environmental lawyers organization ClientEarth, said this result from one of the worlds highest courts sends a clear message: governments must take real action on emissions to safeguard the human rights of their citizens. Switzerlands Federal Office of Justice, which represents the country at the human rights court, said it takes note of the judgement. The comprehensive judgment will be analyzed with the authorities concerned and the measures which Switzerland has to take for the future will be examined, it said in a statement to CNN. The court also delivered judgments on two other claims, one brought by a municipal mayor against the French government and a third, the largest and highest-profile, by six young people in Portugal against 32 European countries. Those two claims were ruled inadmissible. The French claim was ruled out because the claimant had since moved from the country and no longer had links with the region his case focused on, and so did not qualify as a victim for the purposes of the lawsuit. The court dismissed the Portuguese case on the basis that the claimants had not exhausted all legal avenues in their national court system first. It also ruled that there were no grounds to extend the claim to countries outside Portugal. Catarina dos Santos Mota, one of the claimants in that case, said while the ruling did not go their way, the judgment was still a win. We didnt break the wall but weve made a huge crack, she said. I want to see the win against Switzerland being used against all European countries and in national courts. As the climate crisis worsens, climate litigation is becoming an increasingly popular tool to attempt to force governments and companies to step up their climate action, especially as the world remains wildly off course in cutting emissions fast enough to avert catastrophic warming. Environmental activist Greta Thunberg, who attended a demonstration, told reporters outside the court that this is only the beginning of climate litigation. All over the world more and more people are taking their government to court, holding them responsible for their actions, Thunberg said, adding: We are going to use every tool in the toolbox that we have. Tuesdays judgment in favor of the Swiss women sets a precedent for other international courts to follow, Liston, from Global Legal Action Network, told CNN. Both the International Court of Justice and the Inter American Court of Human Rights have cases pending which relate to the human rights impacts of climate change. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "title": "Actor Jonathan Majors avoids jail time for assaulting his ex-girlfriend",
        "date": "April 9, 2024 06:36 pm",
        "content": "Actor Jonathan Majors has been ordered to complete a yearlong counseling program but avoided jail time Monday for assaulting his ex-girlfriend in a high-profile case that derailed the once-promising stars career. The 34-year-old star of Creed III and other films had faced up to a year behind bars after he was convicted of misdemeanor assault by a Manhattan jury in December. In court Monday, Judge Michael Gaffey sentenced Majors to conditional discharge after noting that both sides in the case agreed the charges did not warrant jail time, given the actor was a first time offender with no prior criminal record. He said Majors must complete a 52-week, in-person batterers intervention program in Los Angeles, where the actor lives. He also has to continue with the mental health therapy his lawyers say hes been participating in. Majors faces a year in jail if found in violation of the terms, which also included a no contact order with his former girlfriend, Grace Jabbari. Majors, dressed in all black and accompanied by his girlfriend, actor Meagan Good, declined to address the court and left the courthouse without speaking to reporters. His lawyer, Priya Chaudhry, said the actor did not want to make any public statement that Jabbari could use against him in the civil suit shes filed against the actor. Majors, she added, is committed to growing as a person and will complete any court-mandated programs with an open heart even as he maintains his innocence and plans to appeal. Hes lost his whole career, Chaudhry said in court. This has been the most challenging year of his life. But Jabbari, fighting back tears as she addressed the court, said Majors refuses to acknowledge his guilt and remains a danger to those around him. Hes not sorry. He has not accepted responsibility,  she said. He will do this again and he will hurt other women. He believes he is above the law. Jabbari said Majors had made her believe the two were in a loving relationship, but, in reality, he isolated her from the rest of the world and cut her off from family and friends. I was so emotionally dependent on him, she said. I became a different person around him  small, scared and vulnerable. Rather than acknowledge his actions, Majors has been openly critical of the court proceedings, launching a high-powered PR campaign that included a nationally televised interview, added Assistant District Attorney Kelli Galloway as she argued for a sentence of violence counseling for Majors. Following the December guilty verdict, Majors was immediately dropped by Marvel Studios, which had cast him as Kang the Conqueror, a role envisioned as the main villain in the entertainment empires movies and television shows for years to come. The conviction stemmed from an altercation last March in which Jabbari accused him of attacking her in the backseat of a chauffeured car, saying he hit her head with his open hand, twisted her arm behind her back and squeezed her middle finger until it fractured. Majors claimed the 31-year-old British dancer was the aggressor, flying into a jealous rage after reading a text message from another woman on his phone. He maintained he was only trying to regain his phone and get away from Jabbari safely. Majors had hoped his two-week criminal trial would vindicate him. In a television interview shortly after his conviction, he said he deserves a second chance. But the California native and Yale University graduate still faces Jabbaris civil suit, which she filed last month in Manhattan federal court. In the suit, Jabbari accuses Majors of assault, battery, defamation and inflicting emotional distress, claiming he subjected her to escalating incidents of physical and verbal abuse during their relationship. The two met in 2021 on the set of Marvels Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, in which Majors played Kang. Majors lawyers have declined to respond to the claims, saying only that they are preparing to file counterclaims against Jabbari. The actor had his breakthrough role in 2019s The Last Black Man in San Francisco. He also starred in the HBO horror series Lovecraft Country, which earned him an Emmy nomination, and as the nemesis to fictional boxing champ Adonis Creed in the blockbuster Creed III. As for Marvel, a looming question remains whether the studio will recast the role of Kang or pivot in a new direction. Majors departure was among a recent series of high-profile setbacks for the vaunted superhero factory, which has earned an unprecedented 30 billion worldwide from 33 films. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "April 9, 2024 10:32 pm",
        "content": "Russia and Kazakhstan ordered more than 100,000 people to evacuate after swiftly melting snow swelled mighty rivers beyond bursting point in the worst flooding in the area for at least 70 years. The deluge of melt water overwhelmed scores of settlements in the Ural Mountains, Siberia and areas of Kazakhstan close to rivers such as the Ural and Tobol, which local officials said had risen by metres in a matter of hours to the highest levels ever recorded. The Ural River, Europes third longest which flows through Russia and Kazakhstan into the Caspian, burst through an embankment dam on Friday, flooding the city of Orsk just south of the Ural Mountains. Downstream, water levels in Orenburg, a city of around 550,000, rose towards the critical level of 9.3 metres as sirens warned major floods were imminent. The water level is currently 9.14 metres. Sirens in Kurgan, a city on the Tobol river, a tributary of the Irtysh, warned people to evacuate immediately. An emergency was also declared in Tyumen, a major oil producing region of Western Siberia - the largest hydrocarbon basin in the world. The difficult days are still ahead for the Kurgan and Tyumen regions, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. There is a lot of water coming. President Vladimir Putin spoke to President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev of Kazakhstan, where over 86,000 people have been evacuated due to flooding. Tokayev said the flooding was probably the worst in 80 years. The most severely hit areas are Atyrau, Aktobe, Akmola, Kostanai, Eastern Kazakhstan, Northern Kazakhstan and Pavlodar regions, most of which border Russia and are crossed by rivers originating in Russia such as the Ural and the Tobol. In Russia, anger boiled over in Orsk when at least 100 Russians begged the Kremlin chief to help and chanted shame on you at local officials who they said had done too little. The Kremlin said Putin was getting updated constantly on the situation but that he had no immediate plans to visit the flood zone as local and emergency officials were doing their best to cope with the deluge. EVACUATE NOW In Kurgan, a region with around 800,000 residents, drone footage showed traditional Russian wooden houses and the golden kupolas of Russian Orthodox Churches stranded among a vast expanse of water. In Orenburg, a city of more than half a million, residents paddled along roads as if they were rivers. Dams and embankments were being strengthened as the Ural river rose to nearly 10 metres high. Russian officials have said some people ignored calls to evacuate. Kurgan Governor Vadim Shumkov urged residents to take the warnings seriously. We understand you very well: It is hard to leave your possessions and move somewhere at the call of the local authorities, Shumkov said. Its better that we laugh at the hydrologists together later and praise God for the miracle of our common salvation. But lets do it alive. In Kurgan, water levels were rising in the Tobol and Russia said 19,000 people were at risk in the region. Rising water was also forecast in Siberias Ishim river, also a tributary of the Irtysh, which along with its parent, the Ob, forms the worlds seventh longest river system. It was not immediately clear why this years floods were so bad as the snow melt is an annual event in Russia. Scientists say climate change has made flooding more frequent worldwide.

        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus approach to the war in Gaza is a mistake, U.S. President Joe Biden said in an interview published on Tuesday, offering further criticism of Israels handling of the conflict. I think what hes doing is a mistake. I dont agree with his approach, Biden said in comments to Univision, a U.S. Spanish-language TV network. Biden has also previously called Israels bombing in Gaza indiscriminate, and its military actions over the top. The White House said last week that the president, in a call with Netanyahu, threatened to make conditional, U.S. support for Israels offensive on it taking concrete steps to protect aid workers and civilians. That call followed an Israeli airstrike that killed seven staff of the aid group World Central Kitchen. What Im calling for is for the Israelis to just call for a ceasefire, allow for the next six, eight weeks, total access to all food and medicine going into the country, Biden said in Tuesdays interview. Israels military assault on Gaza, has been the subject of mounting international criticism. Domestically, Biden has also faced months of protests, from anti-war activists, Muslims and Arab Americans across the country, who have demanded a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and restrictions on U.S. military assistance for Israel. Hamas Oct. 7 attack, on Israel killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies. Israels subsequent military assault on Hamas-governed Gaza has killed over 33,000, according to the local health ministry, displaced nearly all of its 2.3 million population and led to genocide allegations that Israel denies. The coastal enclave also suffers widespread hunger. Israel has received more U.S. foreign aid than any other country since World War II, although annual assistance has been dwarfed for two years by funding and military equipment sent to Ukraine since Russias 2022 invasion. The United States has traditionally shielded Israel in the U.N. Security Council and vetoed three draft resolutions on the war in Gaza. It abstained last month when the Security Council demanded an immediate ceasefire. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

Speaking further, the state minister highlighted the shift in consumer behaviour, noting that individuals who previously experienced long queues for fuel are now gathering to purchase apparels and other goods. He attributed this change to the success of the nation-building program initiated by the government led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe.",

        "content": "The government has urged the members of the public to exercise caution and minimize road accidents and fireworks-related incidents during the upcoming Sinhala and Tamil New Year season. Reports indicate that a significant number of accidents take place during this festive period and approximately 36 are attributed to the use of fireworks. In addition, 17 of eye injuries reported during this time are also due to the use of firecrackers and fireworks, according to the government. In response to these concerns, the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Health have collaborated on a special program aimed at raising awareness and reducing incidents of road accidents and firework-related injuries during the festive season. A press conference was convened by the Ministry of Transport and the National Council on Road Safety at the Presidential Media Center (PMC) on Tuesday (09). The purpose of this media briefing was to inform the public about measures being taken to mitigate road accidents during the festive period. Dr. Sajith Ranathunga, a consultant surgeon at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL), highlighted the concerning increase in fatalities resulting from head-on collisions, three-wheeler accidents, and motorcycle accidents. Noting that an alarming number of fatal accidents occur outside of expressways, with approximately 10 deaths occurring daily as a result, he urged the public to exercise caution and take proactive measures to mitigate road accidents. Acting Director General of the National Transport Commission, Nayomi Jayewardene provided insights into ongoing efforts to address road safety concerns. She outlined an awareness program targeting bus owners and drivers aimed at reducing accidents involving buses during the festive season. She also highlighted the operation of a dedicated hotline (1955) available round-the-clock to report drivers violating traffic regulations. Meanwhile, Eng. Priyantha Sooriya Bandara, Director General of the Road Development Authority (RDA), revealed that preparations are underway to manage the influx of vehicles on expressways during the festive season. According to him, with an estimated 200,000 vehicles expected to utilize the expressways, arrangements are being made to keep toll booths open at all gates. Additionally, cashiers stationed at these toll booths are advised to ensure that they have sufficient change available for the convenience of motorists, thereby mitigating traffic congestion. In an effort to enhance safety on the expressways, plans are also in place to establish resting areas for fatigued drivers ahead of the New Year Season.",
