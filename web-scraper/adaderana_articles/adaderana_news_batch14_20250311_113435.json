A spokesperson of the Railway Department explained that the department currently has only about 50 engines suitable for operation. Around 70 engines are needed for the train operations without any issues. Furthermore, it is said that a minimum of 60 train engines are required to operate trains without cancellations or delays. However, the department stated that many of the 50 train engines operational are also experiencing various technical faults. This is due to the fact that a train engine usually has a certain amount of weight to carry, but it is carrying more than its capacity, according to the department. There has also been a shortage of spare parts for repairing train engines in recent times. However, the spokesperson stated that the Department of Railways is currently receiving the spare parts required to repair the engines. Accordingly, it is stated that the necessary steps will be taken to operate the trains without any issues in the future. Meanwhile, it was reported that many of the railway engines owned by the Department of Railways have become unusable due to long periods of inactivity.",

In a letter to the President, the HRCSL emphasized that among the asylum seekers are over 40 children, many of them infants, who arrived by sea off the coast of Mullaitivu a few days ago and rescued by Sri Lanka Navy. The HRCSL further said that an inspection team from the HRCSL, including its Director of Research and Monitoring, attempted to visit the Mullaitivu detention site on December 26, 2024.

The letter noted that subsequent attempts to secure access through written and verbal communications with the Department of Immigration and Emigration and the Ministry of Public Security were also unsuccessful, with the department indicating that ministerial approval was required. In its letter to the President, the HRCSL underscored its statutory mandate under the Human Rights Act, No. 21 of 1996, to monitor the welfare of all detained persons, including asylum seekers. The Commission emphasized its powers to inspect places of detention and to make recommendations for the improvement of detention conditions. The Commissions authority extends to all individuals within Sri Lankas jurisdiction, irrespective of their citizenship. It is imperative that the HRCSL is granted immediate access to the Mullaitivu Air Force Base to fulfill its statutory duty to assess the living conditions and welfare of these asylum seekers, particularly the children among them, the letter stated. The HRCSL has urged the President to direct relevant institutions, including the Department of Immigration and Emigration and the Ministry of Public Security, to facilitate access for its officers to conduct a thorough investigation. The Commission highlighted the importance of safeguarding the rights of vulnerable individuals, including children, as enshrined in both Sri Lankan law and international human rights obligations.",

Despite encountering an unexpected slump in the Womens T20 World Cup, Athapaththu was the second-highest run-getter in a calendar year in womens T20Is. Her 720 runs included two hundreds and four half-centuries, with 86 fours and 32 sixes to her name. Apart from her exploits with the willow, Athapaththu also picked 21 wickets in the period. Her best with the bat and the ball in T20Is came in 2024. Memorable Performance Amidst a series of remarkable performances, including the two centuries in Womens T20 World Cup Qualifier, it was Athapaththus brilliant 61 against India in Dambulla on July 28 that stood out. The innings helped Sri Lanka to their first-ever Asia Cup triumph, and came against much-touted India. The Women in Blue elected to bat first, and got to 1656 courtesy of Smriti Mandhanas 60 from 47. Sri Lanka had an early loss in response, but Athapaththu, who had earlier struck with the ball, held the innings together with Harshitha Samarawickrama. She took the lead in run-scoring as Sri Lanka added 87 runs for the second wicket. By the time Athapaththu was dismissed, she had set a solid base for her side. Samarawickrama then found support in Kavisha Dilhari, and the duo sealed a historic chase.

Besides, the all-rounder also starred with the willow, hitting five scores of 40 while playing a key role in the New Zealand top order. Undoubtedly, Melie Kerrs finest moment came during White Ferns successful run to the title, where the all-rounder scored 135 runs and picked 15 wickets (a Womens T20 World Cup record) in a historic win. Melies numbers picked up as the tournament progressed, with her finest punches coming in the knockout matches. Memorable Performance After New Zealand lost an early wicket in the quest for their maiden T20 World Cup title in the final against South Africa, Melie Kerr walked in stabilised the innings. She soaked in the pressure early on, and then anchored the innings, her solid presence allowing the likes of Brooke Halliday to go for her shots. Melie fell for 43, but helped the White Ferns to 1585 in Dubai.

Wolvaardts prolific run continued into the Womens T20 World Cup, where the opener was the leading run-getter in the tournament. As a leader, she oversaw her side into their maiden final appearance. Memorable Performance Arguably South Africas most important T20 World Cup win came against Australia in the 2024 T20 World Cup semi-final, where Wolvaardt joined Bosch to secure a stunning win. But the foundation for that triumph was set earlier in Canberra, wherein the Proteas beat Australia for the first-ever time in a womens international. Wolvaardt led from the front in the January contest, playing the anchor in a chase of 143. A steady start along with Tazmin Brits put South Africa ahead, but jitters in the middle overs brought back Australia. The South Africa captain, however, kept her cool and remained unbeaten on 58 to secure a brilliant win with six balls to spare. She hit six boundaries in her patient knock. Orla Prendergast (Ireland) Matches 18, Runs 544, Average 36.26, Highest Score 80 Wickets 21, BBI 422, Average 12.9 The year that was Orla Prendergast finished 2024 as the second-highest run-getter and the highest wicket-taker for Ireland in Womens T20Is in any calendar year, and her exemplary numbers were the reason behind their success in the format this year. Ireland began and ended the year with whitewashes over Zimbabwe and Bangladesh respectively, and Prendergast starred in both, also winning the Player of the Series award in the latter contest. Later, her valiant efforts at home helped her side tie series against higher-ranked opponents like England and Sri Lanka. Memorable Performance Prendergast stood tall in the second T20I against neighbouring rivals, England at home in September. Opening the bowler for her side, Prendergast bowled with control and later secured wickets of Georgia Adams and Hollie Armitage towards the end of the innings to get to 231 in her allotted overs, even as England finished at 1698. Then coming in at no. 3, Prendergast walked in after the dismissal of Amy Hunter in the very first over. She then shepherded the chase with a career-best 80, which came off 51 balls and had 13 boundaries in them. By the time she was dismissed, Ireland were on the brink, and managed to seal the chase in the 20th over. Shortlist for ICC Womens ODI Cricketer of the Year Chamari Athapaththu (Sri Lanka) 9 innings, 458 runs at 65.42, Strike Rate 101.10 9 wickets at 32.22 economy 4.61 The year that was Athapaththu didnt actually make her first ODI appearance of 2024 until April, but she immediately hit the ground running as she contributed scores of 51 and 195 in a 1-1 series result against South Africa away from home. The 34-year-old continued with that rich vein of form into the three-match ODI series against the West Indies where she managed 130 runs and four wickets as Sri Lanka completed an emphatic 3-0 series sweep. An innings of 48 and a three-wicket haul with the ball from Sri Lankas final ODI match of the year in Belfast saw Athapaththu end her 2024 on a high in ODI cricket. Memorable performance Athapaththus best performance ironically came in the same contest as Wolvaardt, with the Sri Lanka veteran scoring a superb 195 to lead her side to victory. Chasing north of 300 in an ODI is never easy, but thats exactly what Athapaththu and Sri Lanka made it look as they chased down South Africas score of 3015 with more than five overs remaining. The Sri Lanka skipper smashed 26 fours and five massive sixes during her 139-ball stay, trumping Wolvaardts effort that helped the island nation square the three-match series at 1-1. Laura Wolvaardt (South Africa) 12 innings, 697 runs at 87.12, Strike Rate 87.34 The year that was Wolvaardt commenced the year in a glut as she managed just seven runs from three innings against Australia, but that lack of form didnt last long as the South Africa captain went on a run-scoring spree in almost every ODI contest that followed that series. A pair of unbeaten centuries against Sri Lanka - including a career-best 184 in Potchefstroom - whet Wolvaardts appetite and the 25-year-old then made it three centuries in four matches when she hit 135 against India in Bengaluru in June. Another half-century followed against India, before Wolvaardt finished her 2024 campaign with a trio of good scores against England on home soil in December. Memorable performance Wolvaardt produced her best effort with the bat when she scored a career-best 184 against Sri Lanka in Potchefstroom in April. It was an innings of pure class from the South African right-hander, who smashed 23 fours and four massive sixes in what was a superb individual performance. The innings of 184 came from just 147 deliveries and helped South Africa amass a massive total of 3015 against the Asian side. Smriti Mandhana (India) 12 innings, 743 runs at 61.91, Strike Rate 96.99 1 wicket at 35.00 economy 8.75 The year that was A pair of centuries in June against South Africa in Bengaluru really got Mandhanas 2024 campaign rolling and the left-hander managed two further hundreds later in the year to stay in good touch right up until December. Mandhana managed a total of 343 runs from three innings in a Player of the Series effort against South Africa got her third hundred of 2024 when amassing 100 in the final match of Indias home series against New Zealand right after the completion of the ICC Womens T20 World Cup. Another hundred followed in the final match of her sides three-game series with Australia in December, but that was in vain as the Aussies completed a 3-0 series sweep of their own. Memorable performance Mandhanas best all-round effort came in the second match of Indias home series against South Africa in June, when she scored a century and picked up a key wicket to help her side to a narrow four-wicket victory. The 28-year-old got India; innings going with a brilliant innings of 136 from just 120 deliveries, that included 18 fours and two sixes - as the side managed to amass a big total of 3253 after they were sent into bat. Mandhana then picked up the key wicket of Sune Luus during South Africas reply as the Proteas fell agonisingly short of victory. Annabel Sutherland (Australia) 9 innings, 369 runs at 52.71, Strike Rate 100.27 13 wickets at 17.69 economy 4.19 The year that was The 23-year-old commenced the year with a two-wicket haul in Australias victory over India in Mumbai and was then relatively quiet during a three-match series at home against South Africa that the Aussies managed to win 2-1. Opportunities were scarce for Sutherland during Australias white-ball tour of Bangladesh in March, although the talented all-rounder did manage an unbeaten innings of 58 in an easy victory in the series opener in Mirpur. It wasnt until the backend of the year in consecutive series against India at home and New Zealand away that Sutherland really shone, with the youngster scoring centuries in consecutive matches against different opponents and claiming Player of the Series honours for her efforts against Harmanpreet Kaurs side. Memorable performance Sutherlands best all-round effort came at the famous WACA Ground in Perth when she scored her third ODI century to lead her side to an emphatic 3-0 series sweep over India. The 23-year-old smashed nine fours and four massive sixes at the Perth ground to score 110 from just 95 deliveries and backed up that effort with the bat by claiming the crucial wicket of India captain Harmanpreet Kaur in reply as Australia ran out easy winners.",

        "title": "Georgias outgoing president refuses to quit as successor sworn in",
        "date": "December 29, 2024 07:17 pm",
        "content": "Thousands of Georgians protested in the capital Tbilisi as a new president allied with the ruling Georgian Dream party was inaugurated. Mikheil Kavelashvili, a former pro-footballer, has been sworn in during a critical political period for the country after the government suspended its application to join the European Union. Georgian Dream won parliamentary elections in October, but the victory was mired in allegations of fraud which have since sparked several street protests. Outgoing president Salome Zourabichvili refused to step down on Sunday, saying she was the only legitimate president. Addressing crowds gathered outside, Zourabichvili said she would leave the presidential palace but branded her successor illegitimate. This building was a symbol only as long as a legitimate president was sitting here, she said. A few minutes walk away, Kavelashvili was sworn in at a closed-doors ceremony in parliament, where he was accompanied by his family. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze also attended the inauguration. Speaking after taking the oath, Kavelashvili went on to praise Georgian traditions, values, national identity, the sanctity of the family, and faith. Our history clearly shows that, after countless struggles to defend our homeland and traditions, peace has always been one of the main goals and values for the Georgian people, he said. Georgias four main opposition groups have rejected Kavelashvili and boycotted parliament. Kavelashvili is a former MP with the Georgian Dream party and was the only candidate for the job. Zourabichvili has previously denounced his election as a travesty. Georgian Dream has become increasingly authoritarian in recent years, passing Russian-style laws targeting media and non-government groups who receive foreign funding, and the LGBT community. It refused to join Western sanctions on Russia after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and called the West the global war party, making a mockery of its stated aim of joining the EU and Nato. An overwhelming majority of Georgians back the countrys path to the EU and it is part of the constitution. But in November, the countrys ruling party said the government would not seek EU accession talks until 2028. The announcement sparked days of protests, and riot police used tear gas and water cannon against protesters, who fought back by throwing fireworks and stones. On Saturday, protesters waving Georgian and EU flags gathered again ahead of the inauguration, forming a human chain that spanned kilometres. I am out in the street together with my whole family trying somehow to tear out this small country out of the claws of the Russian empire, one protester told the Associated Press. The US this week imposed sanctions on Georgias former prime minister and billionaire founder of Georgian Dream, Bidzina Ivanishvili. Georgia is a parliamentary democracy with the president the head of state, and the prime minister the head of parliament. When Zourabichvili became president in 2018 she was endorsed by Georgian Dream, but she has since condemned their contested election victory in late October as a Russian special operation and backed nightly pro-EU protests outside parliament.

        "date": "December 29, 2024 09:50 pm",
        "content": "The Archdiocese of Colombo requests for a probe into a recent complaint filed by social activist Namal Kumara regarding a voice recording circulating on social media that defames the reputation of the Archbishop of Colombo, His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith. Speaking to the media today (29), the Media Director of the Archdiocese, Rev. Fr. Jude Krishantha said that activist Namal Kumara is an abettor of the Easter Sunday massacres and asserts that Kumara is plotting another scene at the request of a certain third party. On December 24, activist Namal Kumara filed a complaint with the Presidents Secretariat and the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), claiming that an audio tape was being circulated in social media which defames the reputation of Archbishop of Colombo, His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith. Commenting on this regard, Rev. Fr. Jude Krishantha stated: On behalf of the entire catholic community, I strongly condemn this complaint filed against the cardinal by activist Namal Kumara. This audio tape which was being circulated on social media is believed to be of former MP Ranjan Ramanayake. We think that this was a deliberate attempt to defame the Cardinals reputation, either by Namal Kumaras intent or at the request of a third party. Former Director of the Terrorism Investigation Division DIG Nalaka De Silva, who was investigating on Zaharans activities, was abruptly imprisoned on some absurd charge. This led to the deadly bomb attacks on Easter Sunday. Thereby, it is evident that Nalaka Silva was detained in order to execute this Easter Sunday bombings across areas in the island. Namal Kumara is the main leader of this mission, he added. Taking all these into account, it is clear that Namal Kumara is abetting someone to plot another scene. We consider these as some doings of the Rajapaksa family. Therefore, we request the Inspector General of Police to initiate an investigation and serve justice as these allegations raised by Namal Kumara have damaged the reputation of His Eminence Cardinal Ranjith, Rev. Fr. Jude Krishantha expressed further.",

        "date": "December 29, 2024 10:09 pm",
        "content": "The MSME Chamber of Sri Lanka has called for the immediate removal of the circular issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), which states that any suspension of Parate law execution will not take place beyond 31 March 2025. Speaking at a press briefing, Media Secretary of the MSME Chamber of Sri Lanka Susantha Liyanaarachchi emphasized the need for the CBSL to issue a new circular pertaining to the recent statement made by the Deputy Minister of Finance. Commenting further, Liyanaarachchi said: The deputy minister of finance explained to the countrys banks what to do. His statement said that either the banks have to completely remove the interest or focus on a long-term debt repayment. He also instructed that no action should be taken if the defaulters have filed lawsuits. So, they must know that this must be activated before the 1st of January next year. The Governor of the Central Bank released a circular on the 20th of December, stating that the Sri Lanka Bank Association was of the view that any suspension of Parate execution will not be beyond the 31st of March 2025. How do they have the right to say these things? The governor cannot just release circulars according to what these associations say, he added. However, if the Central Bank Governor is thinking of pulling tricks like in the previous government, he will not be able to do so now. Therefore, we request the repeal of the circular that was issued on the 20th of December and release a circular according to the statement made by the Deputy Minister of Finance. If it is not be done, we will predict what will happen next to the banks next year, he stressed.",

        "title": "Former US president and Nobel Peace Prize winner Jimmy Carter dies at 100",
        "date": "December 30, 2024 08:18 am",
        "content": "Jimmy Carter, the earnest Georgia peanut farmer who as U.S. president struggled with a bad economy and the Iran hostage crisis but brokered peace between Israel and Egypt and later received the Nobel Peace Prize for his humanitarian work, died at his home in Plains, Georgia, on Sunday. He was 100. Carter, a Democrat, became president in January 1977 after defeating incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford in the 1976 election. His one-term presidency was marked by the highs of the 1978 Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt, bringing some stability to the Middle East. But it was also dogged by an economic recession, persistent unpopularity and the Iran hostage crisis that consumed his final 444 days in office. Carter ran for re-election in 1980 but was swept from office in a landslide as voters embraced Republican challenger Ronald Reagan, the former actor and California governor. Carter lived longer than any U.S. president and, after leaving the White House, earned a reputation as a committed humanitarian. He was widely seen as a better former president than he was a president - a status he readily acknowledged. World leaders and former U.S. presidents paid tribute to a man they praised as compassionate, humble and committed to peace in the Middle East. His significant role in achieving the peace agreement between Egypt and Israel will remain etched in the annals of history, said Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in a post on X. The Carter Center said there will be public observances in Atlanta and Washington. These events will be followed by a private interment in Plains, it said. Final arrangements for the former presidents state funeral are still pending, according to the center. In recent years, Carter had experienced several health issues including melanoma that spread to his liver and brain. Carter decided to receive hospice care in February 2023 instead of undergoing additional medical intervention. His wife, Rosalynn Carter, died on Nov. 19, 2023, at age 96. He looked frail when he attended her memorial service and funeral in a wheelchair. Carter left office profoundly unpopular but worked energetically for decades on humanitarian causes. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 in recognition of his untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development. Carter had been a centrist as governor of Georgia with populist tendencies when he moved into the White House as the 39th U.S. president. He was a Washington outsider at a time when America was still reeling from the Watergate scandal that led Republican Richard Nixon to resign as president in 1974 and elevated Ford from vice president. Im Jimmy Carter and Im running for president. I will never lie to you, Carter promised with an ear-to-ear smile. Asked to assess his presidency, Carter said in a 1991 documentary: The biggest failure we had was a political failure. I never was able to convince the American people that I was a forceful and strong leader. Despite his difficulties in office, Carter had few rivals for accomplishments as a former president. He gained global acclaim as a tireless human rights advocate, a voice for the disenfranchised and a leader in the fight against hunger and poverty, winning the respect that eluded him in the White House. Carter won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his efforts to promote human rights and resolve conflicts around the world, from Ethiopia and Eritrea to Bosnia and Haiti. His Carter Center in Atlanta sent international election-monitoring delegations to polls around the world. A Southern Baptist Sunday school teacher since his teens, Carter brought a strong sense of morality to the presidency, speaking openly about his religious faith. He also sought to take some pomp out of an increasingly imperial presidency - walking, rather than riding in a limousine, in his 1977 inauguration parade. The Middle East was the focus of Carters foreign policy. The 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty, based on the 1978 Camp David accords, ended a state of war between the two neighbors. Carter brought Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland for talks. Later, as the accords seemed to be unraveling, Carter saved the day by flying to Cairo and Jerusalem for personal shuttle diplomacy. The treaty provided for Israeli withdrawal from Egypts Sinai Peninsula and establishment of diplomatic relations. Begin and Sadat each won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1978. By the 1980 election, the overriding issues were double-digit inflation, interest rates that exceeded 20 and soaring gas prices, as well as the Iran hostage crisis that brought humiliation to America. These issues marred Carters presidency and undermined his chances of winning a second term. HOSTAGE CRISIS On Nov. 4, 1979, revolutionaries devoted to Irans Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, seized the Americans present and demanded the return of the ousted shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was backed by the United States and was being treated in a U.S. hospital. The American public initially rallied behind Carter. But his support faded in April 1980 when a commando raid failed to rescue the hostages, with eight U.S. soldiers killed in an aircraft accident in the Iranian desert. Carters final ignominy was that Iran held the 52 hostages until minutes after Reagan took his oath of office on Jan. 20, 1981, to replace Carter, then released the planes carrying them to freedom. In another crisis, Carter protested the former Soviet Unions 1979 invasion of Afghanistan by boycotting the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. He also asked the U.S. Senate to defer consideration of a major nuclear arms accord with Moscow. Unswayed, the Soviets remained in Afghanistan for a decade. Carter won narrow Senate approval in 1978 of a treaty to transfer the Panama Canal to the control of Panama despite critics who argued the waterway was vital to American security. He also completed negotiations on full U.S. ties with China. Carter created two new U.S. Cabinet departments - education and energy. Amid high gas prices, he said Americas energy crisis was the moral equivalent of war and urged the country to embrace conservation. Ours is the most wasteful nation on earth, he told Americans in 1977. In 1979, Carter delivered what became known as his malaise speech to the nation, although he never used that word. After listening to the American people I have been reminded again that all the legislation in the world cant fix whats wrong with America, he said in his televised address. The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways. It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America. As president, the strait-laced Carter was embarrassed by the behavior of his hard-drinking younger brother, Billy Carter, who had boasted: I got a red neck, white socks, and Blue Ribbon beer. THERE YOU GO AGAIN Jimmy Carter withstood a challenge from Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy for the 1980 Democratic presidential nomination but was politically diminished heading into his general election battle against a vigorous Republican adversary. Reagan, the conservative who projected an image of strength, kept Carter off balance during their debates before the November 1980 election. Reagan dismissively told Carter, There you go again, when the Republican challenger felt the president had misrepresented Reagans views during one debate. Carter lost the 1980 election to Reagan, who won 44 of the 50 states and amassed an Electoral College landslide. James Earl Carter Jr. was born on Oct. 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia, one of four children of a farmer and shopkeeper. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1946, served in the nuclear submarine program and left to manage the family peanut farming business. He married his wife, Rosalynn, in 1946, a union he called the most important thing in my life. They had three sons and a daughter. Carter became a millionaire, a Georgia state legislator and Georgias governor from 1971 to 1975. He mounted an underdog bid for the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination, and out-hustled his rivals for the right to face Ford in the general election. With Walter Mondale as his vice presidential running mate, Carter was given a boost by a major Ford gaffe during one of their debates. Ford said that there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration, despite decades of just such domination. Carter edged Ford in the election, even though Ford actually won more states - 27 to Carters 23. Not all of Carters post-presidential work was appreciated. Former President George W. Bush and his father, former President George H.W. Bush, both Republicans, were said to have been displeased by Carters freelance diplomacy in Iraq and elsewhere. In 2004, Carter called the Iraq war launched in 2003 by the younger Bush one of the most gross and damaging mistakes our nation ever made. He called George W. Bushs administration the worst in history and said Vice President Dick Cheney was a disaster for our country. In 2019, Carter questioned Republican Donald Trumps legitimacy as president, saying he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf. Trump responded by calling Carter a terrible president. Carter also made trips to communist North Korea. A 1994 visit defused a nuclear crisis, as President Kim Il Sung agreed to freeze his nuclear program in exchange for resumed dialogue with the United States. That led to a deal in which North Korea, in return for aid, promised not to restart its nuclear reactor or reprocess the plants spent fuel. But Carter irked Democratic President Bill Clintons administration by announcing the deal with North Koreas leader without first checking with Washington. In 2010, Carter won the release of an American sentenced to eight years hard labor for illegally entering North Korea. Carter wrote more than two dozen books, ranging from a presidential memoir to a childrens book and poetry, as well as works about religious faith and diplomacy. His book Faith: A Journey for All, was published in 2018. Source: AP --Agencies",

Posting on X (formerly Twitter), Dissanayake said former U.S. President Carters extraordinary life was marked by an unwavering commitment to peace, human rights and humanitarian affairs in recognition of which he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. May his legacy live on as a beacon of hope to build a better world for all, he added. Jimmy Carter, the earnest Georgia peanut farmer who as U.S. president struggled with a bad economy and the Iran hostage crisis but brokered peace between Israel and Egypt and later received the Nobel Peace Prize for his humanitarian work, died at his home in Plains, Georgia, on Sunday. Carter lived longer than any U.S. president and, after leaving the White House, earned a reputation as a committed humanitarian.

        "date": "December 30, 2024 02:04 pm",
        "content": "China has unveiled its next-generation high-speed train, the CR450 prototype, which has achieved test speeds of 450 kilometre per hour (kmh), making it the fastest train in the world. The CR450 surpasses the current CR400 Fuxing trains, which operate at speeds of 350 kmh, marking a significant leap in rail technology. According to state media, the CR450 project, initiated in 2021, focused on safety, energy efficiency, and passenger comfort. The train features a streamlined design that reduces energy consumption by over 20 per cent, alongside an optimized braking system to ensure stability and safety at unprecedented speeds. The prototypes, designated CR450AF and CR450BF, utilize advanced technologies such as water-cooled, permanent magnet traction systems and high-stability bogie systems. These innovations are part of Chinas broader effort to consolidate its position as a global leader in railway technology. Chinas high-speed railway system has shifted from being a follower to a global leader, said Li Yongheng of the China State Railway Group, as reported by China Daily. State media also highlighted passenger-friendly features of the CR450, including increased cabin space, noise reduction technologies, and adjustable storage options for bicycles and wheelchairs. The use of advanced materials like carbon fibre reduces the trains weight, enhancing energy efficiency and sustainability. The CR450s debut underscores Chinas ambition to set new global standards in rail transport. With the worlds largest high-speed rail network spanning 47,000 km, China plans to leverage its expertise to significantly shorten travel times. For instance, the Beijing-Shanghai journey, currently 4.5 hours, could be reduced to just over three hours with the CR450. While the commercial launch date remains unconfirmed, China Railway hinted at a possible rollout as early as next year. Efforts to refine the trains operational capabilities through further testing are ongoing. The unveiling of the CR450 represents a milestone in Chinas high-speed rail development, showcasing its commitment to advancing rail technology and promoting sustainable transport solutions.

        "date": "December 30, 2024 03:38 pm",
        "content": "Two England batting mainstays, Indias pace spearhead, and a new star in Sri Lankan ranks make for a glittering list of nominees for ICC Mens Test Cricketer of The Year. Joe Root (England) 1556 runs from 17 Tests, average 55.57 The year that was 2024 saw the former England captain continue his impressive run in the longest format of the game. Across 17 Tests, Joe Root compiled his second-best annual run-tally in Tests - second only to his 1708 runs from 2021. It was also the fifth instance of Root scoring over 1000 Test runs in a calendar year. With six Test hundreds to go alongside five half-centuries, Root was a consistent performer for England - both home and away. His impressive run with the bat saw Root amass joint-fifth highest tons in Tests (36) alongside Rahul Dravid. In addition to his batting exploits, Root also provided an extra spin option, and impressed with a four-wicket haul in the marquee series against India. Memorable performance A milestone innings for Root came in Multan, during the first of three Tests against Pakistan. The England top-order batter amassed a career-best score of 262 - his sixth double hundred, putting him on level terms with the likes of Ricky Ponting and Sachin Tendulkar. Combining alongside Harry Brook (317), Root helped England post the fourth-highest innings total in Test history, eventually scripting a famous win by an innings and 47 runs. Jasprit Bumrah (India) 71 wickets from 13 Tests, average 14.92 The year that was Having returned to the Test arena following his recovery from a recurring back injury in 2023, Bumrah dominated the bowling charts in 2024. Featuring across 13 Tests in the calendar year, Bumrah delivered his best-ever annual tally - 71 wickets - finishing the year with more Test wickets than any of his counterparts. Be it the pace-conducive conditions in South Africa and Australia, or tougher conditions for quicks at home, Bumrah was equally impressive through the year. However, it was on Indias tour of Australia that the pace spearhead produced his magnum opus. Memorable performance Leading India in the absence of full-time skipper Rohit Sharma, Bumrah put in a captains display to guide the visitors to a mammoth 295-run win in Perth. With India having been dismissed for 150 in the first innings, Bumrah wrestled back control of the match with a five-wicket haul that helped set in motion a famous comeback. With Australia chasing 534 in the last innings, the Indian skipper also snapped three wickets to wrap up the win. The performance won him the player of the match award and propelled Bumrah back to the top of the ICC Mens Test Bowling Rankings. Kamindu Mendis (Sri Lanka) 1049 runs from nine Tests, average 74.92 The year that was Sri Lankas new middle-order mainstay was the sixth batter to score over 1000 runs in Mens Tests across the year. Putting in a admirable performances both home and away, Mendis boasted incredible numbers. The most notable was him becoming the joint-third quickest to score 1000 Test runs - equalling Sir Don Bradmans 13-innings mark to reach the milestone. Mendis averaged more than any of the batters who played more than two Tests in the calendar year - a staggering 74.92 from nine matches. His performances with the bat helped Sri Lanka push their claim for their first-ever appearance in the ICC World Test Championship Final with wins over New Zealand, England and Bangladesh. Memorable performance Mendis was the leading protagonist in Sri Lankas 2-0 series sweep against New Zealand at home, scoring twin hundreds across the two Tests. His highlight innings came in Galle, where he stitched an unbeaten 182 off 250 deliveries - his best-ever Test score. It was a player of the match display that helped the hosts wrap up the series win in Galle. Harry Brook (England) 1100 runs from 12 Tests, average 55.00 The year that was A flagbearer of Englands quickfire brand of batting, Harry Brook emerged as a breakthrough performer in the longest format. The 25-year-old scored 1100 runs at a strike rate of 85.00, comprising three fifties and four hundred plus scores, which also included a maiden triple century. A noticeable trait in his performances was the fact that most of his runs (723) came away from home while playing the same number of games as he did in England (6). To wrap the year on a successful note, Brook closed the tour of New Zealand as the top-scorer to round off Englands first series win in the country since 2008. Owing to his impact with the bat, Brook managed to displace Joe Root to reign supreme in the Mens ICC Test Rankings. Memorable performance As England won the opening Test against Pakistan in Multan back in October, Brook emerged as Englands leading performer. Scoring his first-ever triple hundred - a blistering 317 off 322 deliveries - the right-handed batter guided England to their third highest Test total (and fourth overall). The innings saw him nail 29 fours and three sixes. It led to a massive win for the visitors by an innings and 47 runs. --ICC",

        "content": "Three stylish all-rounders and a batting stalwart who enjoyed a stellar 2024 across formats make it to the nominees for the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy for Womens Cricketer of the Year. Chamari Athapaththu 458 runs across nine ODIs, averaging 65.42, Highest score 195; 9 wickets, Best figures 315 720 runs across 21 T20Is, Averaging 40, Highest score 119; 21 wickets, Best figures 429 The year that was Sri Lankas all-format captain has been producing the goods with the bat for a long time now for her country. Athapathu is ranked among the top 10 players in the ICC Womens rankings for batters and all-rounders in ODIs as well as T20Is, proving her mettle with both bat and ball. A stellar year with over 1000 runs across formats, picking up 30 wickets as well along the way has underlined her position as one of the most impactful players in womens cricket. The 34-year-old was the Player of the Tournament for her 304 runs and three wickets at the Womens Asia Cup in July, leading her side to their maiden crown. Memorable performance Athapaththus standout performance in 2024 came during an ODI against South Africa in Potchefstroom, where she scored an unbeaten 195 from 139 deliveries to guide Sri Lanka over the line. This incredible knock not only showcased her brilliance but also became the third-highest individual score in womens ODI history. Her innings included a dazzling array of boundaries, displaying her mastery over the South African bowling attack. Laura Wolvaardt 697 runs across 12 ODIs, averaging 87.12, Highest score 184 223 runs across three Tests, averaging 37.16, Highest score 122 673 runs across 9 T20Is, averaging 39.58, Highest score 102 The year that was Laura Wolvaardt has been a force to reckon with for the Proteas, leading the team from the front as the all-format skipper as well as piling up runs when needed at the top of the batting order.

Wolvaardts absolute best with the bat came when she scored her career-best 184 against Sri Lanka in Potchefstroom in April. The 25-year-old led South Africa to the ICC Womens T20 World Cup 2024 Final, where she top scored for the Proteas as they emerged runners-up in the tournament, losing out to the White Ferns in the decider. Wolvaardt was also the leading run-getter at the tournament. Memorable performance In April, Wolvaardt delivered a stunning batting display, achieving her career-best 184 against Sri Lanka in Potchefstroom.

        "title": "South Korean authorities seek warrant to detain impeached President Yoon",
        "date": "December 30, 2024 04:52 pm",
        "content": "South Korean law enforcement officials requested a court warrant on Monday to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol as they investigate whether his short-lived martial law decree on Dec. 3 amounted to rebellion. The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which leads a joint investigation with police and military authorities into the power grab that lasted only a few hours, confirmed it requested the warrant from the Seoul Western District Court. They plan to question Yoon on charges of abuse of authority and orchestrating a rebellion. Yoon Kap-keun, the presidents lawyer, denounced the detention attempt and filed a challenge with the same court, arguing that the warrant request was invalid. He also claimed the anti-corruption agency lacked the legal authority to investigate rebellion charges. Still, he evaded answering how the legal team would respond if the court approved the warrant for the presidents detainment. An incumbent president cannot be prosecuted for abuse of power, the lawyer said. Of course, there are differing academic opinions on whether a president can be investigated for abuse of power and some assert that investigations are possible. But even when investigations are allowed, the prevailing opinion is that they should be exercised with the utmost restraint. The anti-corruption agency didnt immediately respond to the lawyers comments. Han Min-soo, spokesperson of the liberal opposition Democratic Party, called for the court to issue the warrant, saying Yoon Suk Yeols detainment would be the first step toward ending the rebellion and restoring normalcy. The warrant request came after Yoon dodged several requests by the joint investigation team and public prosecutors to appear for questioning and also blocked searches of his offices. While Yoon has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution, such protections dont extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. Its not clear whether the court will grant the warrant or whether Yoon can be compelled to appear for questioning. Under the countrys laws, locations potentially linked to military secrets cannot be seized or searched without the consent of the person in charge, and its unlikely that Yoon will voluntarily leave his residence if he faces detention. There are also concerns about possible clashes with Yoons presidential security service if authorities attempt to forcibly detain him. Yoons presidential powers were suspended after the National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14 over his imposition of martial law, which lasted only hours but has triggered weeks of political turmoil, halted high-level diplomacy and rattled financial markets. Yoons fate now lies with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberations on whether to uphold the impeachment and formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him. The National Assembly voted last week to also impeach Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who had assumed the role of acting president after Yoons powers were suspended, over his reluctance to fill three Constitutional Court vacancies ahead of the courts review of Yoons case. The countrys new interim leader is Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, who is also finance minister. To formally end Yoons presidency, at least six justices on the nine-member Constitutional Court must vote in favor. Three seats are currently vacant following retirements and a full bench could make conviction more likely. Choi, who has been handling the governments response to a plane crash on Sunday that killed 179 people, has yet to say whether he intends to appoint the Constitutional Court justices. In a separate criminal investigation of Yoon, authorities have already arrested his defense minister, police chief and several other military commanders involved in the attempt to enforce the martial law decree, which harkened back to the days of authoritarian leaders the country hasnt seen since the 1980s. In theory, the authority to investigate rebellion charges lies solely with the police, following a 2021 reform that redistributed investigative powers among law enforcement agencies and removed rebellion from the list of crimes prosecutors and the anti-corruption office could pursue. But those agencies have still been investigating rebellion accusations against Yoon, allegedly linked to charges related to abuse of power, a type of crime they are authorized to investigate. Yoon and his military leadership have been accused of attempting to block the National Assembly from voting to end martial law by sending hundreds of heavily armed troops to encircle the building. Lawmakers who managed to get in voted unanimously 190-0 to lift martial law, hours after Yoon declared it in a late-night television address. Yoon has also been accused of ordering defense counterintelligence officials to detain key politicians, including opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik and the ex-leader of his own conservative party, Han Dong-hun, a reformist who supported investigations into corruption allegations against first lady Kim Keon Hee. Yoon has defended the martial law decree as a necessary act of governance, portraying it as a temporary warning against the liberal opposition Democratic Party, which he has described as an anti-state force obstructing his agenda with its majority in the National Assembly. Yoon has claimed he had no intention to paralyze the functioning of the assembly, saying that the troops were sent to maintain order, and also denied planning to arrest politicians. Yoons claims have been denied by Kwak Jong-keun, the now-arrested commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, who testified in the National Assembly that Yoon called for troops to quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside the assemblys main chamber where the vote occurred. Kwak said he did not carry out Yoons orders. The joint investigation team has also questioned Maj. Gen. Moon Sang-ho, commander of the Defense Intelligence Command who has also been arrested over suspicions that he sent troops to the National Election Commission in the city of Gwacheon after Yoon declared martial law. Yoon has defended the troop deployment to the election commission, which happened at the same time as the military operation at the National Assembly, saying it was necessary to investigate supposed vulnerabilities in the commissions computer systems potentially affecting the credibility of election results. Yoons failure to offer any evidence in support of his claims has raised concerns that he was endorsing conspiracy theories on right-wing YouTube channels that Aprils parliamentary elections were rigged. The Democratic Party won those elections by a landslide. The election commission rejected Yoons allegations, stating there was no basis to suspect election fraud. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "Colombo Chief Magistrate Thilina Gamage has requested the Judicial Services Commission (JSC) to transfer to another court the hearings of the case filed by the Bribery Commission against two individuals including former Western Provincial Councilor Salochana Gamage for allegedly soliciting a bribe of Rs. 9 million. The Colombo Chief Magistrate has reportedly emphasized that his court is unable to proceed with the hearings of the said bribery case as Salochana Gamage, one of the defendants, is his brother and thereby poses a conflict of interest. Accordingly, he has requested the Judicial Services Commission in writing to appoint another suitable magistrate to proceed with the hearings related to the case. On Saturday (28), the Colombo Additional Magistrate ordered the two accused including former member of Western Provincial Council Salochana Gamage, who were arrested while accepting a bribe, to be remanded in custody until January 06, 2025. The officers of the Bribery Commission arrested a businessman and the former Western Provincial Council member allegedly while accepting a bribe of Rs. 09 million from another businessman at Pita Kotte on the promise of expediting compensation for a land of the complainants relative in Torrington Avenue, which was acquired by the Urban Development Authority (UDA).",

        "content": "Five people have been charged in connection with the death of One Direction singer Liam Payne in Argentina, local media report. The 31-year-old star died on 16 October after falling from the third-floor balcony of a hotel in Buenos Aires. Hotel manager Gilda Martin and hotel employee Esteban Grassi as well as Roger Nores, who reportedly was a friend of Payne, have been charged with manslaughter, Argentinas National Criminal and Correctional Prosecutors Office is quoted as saying. Braian Paiz and Ezequiel Pereyra - who both reportedly worked at the hotel - have been charged with supplying drugs. A judge has ordered that two of the five accused should be remanded in custody, according to the Argentinian news website Infobae. The pair, whose names have not been reported, have been summoned to appear in court within 24 working hours, Infobae added. The BBC has reached out to the prosecutors office for comment. Argentinian authorities have been investigating Paynes final days at the CasaSur hotel. It was previously announced in November that three people had been charged over his death but their names were not released at the time. Speaking to US celebrity news outlet TMZ after Paynes death, Roger Nores said he was a very good friend of the singer and they had spent time together on the day the star died. He said Payne seemed playful and happy when he left him about an hour before the musician fell from the balcony. After Paynes death, police found substances in his hotel room and objects and furniture that had been damaged. Hotel staff had made two calls to emergency services saying they had a guest who had taken too many drugs and alcohol, and was trashing the entire room, it was previously reported.

        "title": "South Korea orders airline safety probe after worst domestic crash kills 179",
        "date": "December 30, 2024 09:47 pm",
        "content": "South Koreas acting President Choi Sang-mok on Monday ordered an emergency safety inspection of the countrys entire airline operation as investigators worked to identify victims and find out what caused the deadliest air disaster on South Korean soil. All 175 passengers and four of the six crew were killed when a Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 belly-landed and skidded off the end of the runway at Muan International Airport, erupting in a fireball as it slammed into a wall. Two crew members were pulled out alive. The top priority for now is identifying the victims, supporting their families and treating the two survivors, Choi told a disaster management meeting in Seoul. Even before the final results are out, we ask that officials transparently disclose the accident investigation process and promptly inform the bereaved families, he said. As soon as the accident recovery is conducted, the transport ministry is requested to conduct an emergency safety inspection of the entire aircraft operation system to prevent recurrence of aircraft accidents, he said. As a first step, the transport ministry announced plans to conduct a special inspection of all 101 Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by South Korean airliners beginning on Monday, focusing on the maintenance record of key components. Jeju Air flight 7C2216, arriving from the Thai capital Bangkok, was trying to land shortly after 9 a.m. on Sunday at the airport in the south of the country. Investigators are examining bird strikes, whether any of the aircrafts control systems were disabled, and the apparent rush by the pilots to attempt a landing soon after declaring an emergency as possible factors in the crash, fire and transportation officials have said. Experts say many questions remain, including why the plane, powered by two CFM 56-7B26 engines, appeared to be travelling so fast and why its landing gear did not appear to be down when it skidded down the runway and into a concrete embankment. CFM International is a joint venture between GE Aerospace and Frances Safran. On Monday, transport ministry officials said as the pilots made a scheduled approach they told air traffic control the aircraft had suffered a bird strike, shortly after the control tower gave them a warning birds were spotted in the vicinity. The pilots then issued a Mayday warning and signalled their intention to abandon the landing and to go around and try again. Shortly afterwards, the aircraft came down on the runway in a belly landing, touching down about 1,200 metres (1,310 yards) along the 2,800 metre (3,062 yard) runway and sliding into the embankment at the end of the landing strip. You dont have a wall Officials are investigating what role the localiser antenna, located at the end of the runway to help in landing, played in the crash, including the concrete embankment on which it was standing, transport ministry officials told a media briefing. Normally, on an airport with a runway at the end, you dont have a wall, said Christian Beckert, a flight safety expert and Lufthansa pilot based in Munich. You more have maybe an engineered material arresting system, which lets the airplane sink into the ground a little bit and brakes (it). The crash killed mostly local residents who were returning from holidays in Thailand, while two Thai nationals also died. I can only accept it, make peace with it, said Boonchuay Duangmanee, 77, the father of one of the Thai victims. When I think about it, I remind myself that it was an accident. Its something that can happen to anyone. So, Ive come to terms with it because no matter what I do, my daughter wont come back. On Monday morning, investigators were trying to identify some of the more than two dozen remaining victims, as anguished families waited inside the Muan airport terminal. Park Han-shin, who lost his brother in the crash, said he was told by authorities that his brother had been identified but has not been able to see his body. Park called on victims families to unite in responding to the disaster, citing a 2014 ferry sinking that killed more than 300 people. Many relatives of the victims of the Sewol ferry disaster complained it took authorities too long to identify those killed and the cause of that accident. Transportation ministry officials said the jets flight data recorder was recovered but appeared to have sustained some damage on the outside and it was not yet clear whether the data was sufficiently intact to be analysed. The recorder has been transported to Seoul and an analysis will begin when a team of U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and Boeing officials arrive in the country late on Monday, the officials told reporters. Muan International Airport remains closed through Wednesday but the rest of South Koreas international and regional airports including the main Incheon International Airport were operating as scheduled. Shares of Jeju Air hit their lowest level on record on Monday, trading as much as 15.7 lower. Boeings U.S.-listed shares fell 4.2 in early trading and were set to lose about 5 billion in market capitalization. Under global aviation rules, South Korea will lead a civil investigation into the crash and automatically involve the NTSB since the plane was designed and built in the United States. A large memorial has been set up in a county gym about 9 km (5 miles) from the crash site, where people including acting President Choi came to pay respects. Choi, who is overseeing recovery efforts and the investigation, became acting leader just three days ago after the countrys president and prime minister were impeached over the imposition of a short-lived martial law. The aviation insurance industry could be looking at a claim for about 15-20 million under the airline hull insurance policy, and total passenger liability claims of 120-180 million due to the crash, according to Marcos Alvarez, managing director of global insurance ratings at Morningstar DBRS.

        "date": "December 31, 2024 09:05 am",
        "content": "A South Korean court on Tuesday approved an arrest warrant for President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has been impeached and suspended from power over his decision to impose martial law on Dec. 3, investigating authorities said. The Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) confirmed the Seoul Western District Court approved the warrant requested by investigators examining Yoons short-lived imposition of martial law. This is the first arrest warrant issued for an incumbent president in South Korea, according to local media. The current arrest warrant is viable until Jan. 6, and once it is exercised, Yoon is expected to be held at the Seoul Detention Center, Yonhap news agency said citing CIO. The court issued the warrant due to the likelihood that Yoon will not respond to summons without a justifiable reason, and there being a substantial reason to suspect Yoon of a crime, Yonhap said. The court declined to comment. Yoon has failed to respond to investigators summons for questioning three times since the Dec. 3 martial law declaration. Yoon is facing criminal investigation on allegations that he was the leader of an insurrection. Insurrection is one of the few charges for which a South Korean president does not have immunity. It was unclear when or how the arrest warrant for Yoon will be carried out. South Koreas presidential security service said in a statement on Tuesday that it will treat the arrest warrant according to due process. The court also approved a search warrant for Yoons residence, the CIO said. Previously, police tried but failed to successfully raid the presidential office as part of the investigation, due to the presidential security service blocking access. The acting leader of South Koreas ruling People Power Party, Kweon Seong-dong, said on Tuesday that attempting to detain a sitting president is inappropriate. Kim Yong-min, a lawmaker in the opposition Democratic Party, which holds a majority in parliament and brought on Yoons impeachment vote, said on Tuesday the process of executing the warrant and investigation could be very difficult, calling for investigators to immediately execute the warrants.

        "date": "December 31, 2024 11:09 am",
        "content": "Chinese state-sponsored hackers breached the U.S. Treasury Departments computer security guardrails this month and stole documents in what Treasury called a major incident, according to a letter to lawmakers, that Treasury officials provided to Reuters on Monday. The hackers compromised third-party cybersecurity service provider BeyondTrust and were able to access unclassified documents, the letter said. According to the letter, hackers gained access to a key used by the vendor to secure a cloud-based service used to remotely provide technical support for Treasury Departmental Offices (DO) end users. With access to the stolen key, the threat actor was able to override the services security, remotely access certain Treasury DO user workstations, and access certain unclassified documents maintained by those users. The Treasury Department said it was alerted to the breach by BeyondTrust on Dec. 8 and that it was working with the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the FBI to assess the hacks impact. Treasury officials didnt immediately respond to an email seeking further details about the hack. The FBI did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment, while CISA referred questions back to the Treasury Department. A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington rejected any responsibility for the hack, saying that Beijing firmly opposes the U.S.s smear attacks against China without any factual basis. A spokesperson for BeyondTrust, based in Johns Creek, Georgia, told Reuters in an email that the company previously identified and took measures to address a security incident in early December 2024 involving its remote support product. BeyondTrust notified the limited number of customers who were involved, and law enforcement was notified, the spokesperson said. BeyondTrust has been supporting the investigative efforts. The spokesperson referred to a statement posted on the companys on Dec. 8 sharing some details from the investigation, including that a digital key had been compromised in the incident and that an investigation was under way. That statement was last updated Dec. on 18. Tom Hegel, a threat researcher at cybersecurity company SentinelOne, said the reported security incident fits a well-documented pattern of operations by PRC-linked groups, with a particular focus on abusing trusted third-party services - a method that has become increasingly prominent in recent years, he said, using an acronym for the Peoples Republic of China.

        "title": "SC delivers verdict in petitions against govts decision on 2024 Scholarship Exam",
        "date": "December 31, 2024 11:11 am",
        "content": "The Supreme Court has declared that the fundamental human rights have been violated through the governments decision to award free marks to all students for the three questions of the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination which are alleged to have been leaked. Accordingly, the court also ordered the Commissioner General of Examinations to immediately implement a suitable recommendation out of the three recommendations made by the experts committee appointed to look into the matter. Additionally, the judge bench also fined the suspects who have allegedly assisted in leaking the three questions of the question paper ii of the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination. Accordingly, the Director of the Planning Division of the National Institute of Education (NIE) in Maharagama, I.G.S. Prematilake, was ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 3 million to the government while Chaminda Kumara Ilangasinghe, a school teacher, was fined Rs. 2 million. Issuing the verdict, the Supreme Court declared that both the provisions of the Constitution as well as the provisions of the Public Examinations Act would not empower either the Minister or the Secretary to the Ministry to participate in the decision-making process, issue directions to the Commissioner of Examinations, assume to themselves the decision-making power, or influence the process in a manner that would take away, curtail or inhibit the discretionary authority vested in the Commissioner of Examinations by the Public Examinations Act. This does not mean that the public functionary cannot engage in a process of consultation with the Minister or the Secretary, subject to the important caveat that the final decision must always be that of the public functionary who is required by law to take such decision, the court verdict reads. Furthermore, the Supreme Court has also stated that however, neither the authority vested in the Minister and the Secretary to engage in superintendence, nor the authority to supervise the functions of the Commissioner of Examinations would include legal authority to usurp the power vested in the Commissioner of Examinations and that similarly, the Commissioner of Examinations cannot abdicate expressly or impliedly either to the Minister or to the Secretary, the decision-making authority vested in him by law. During previous hearings, the court was informed that the Cabinet of Ministers had recommended to award free marks to all students for the 03 questions which were alleged to have been leaked in the 2024 Grade 5 Scholarship Examination. This verdict was issued by the three-member Supreme Court judge bench comprising Justices Yasantha Kodagoda, Kumuduni Wickremesinghe and Arjuna Obeysekara, following the consideration of four petitions filed by a group of students who sat for the examination and their parents, expressing concerns over the fairness of the process. The petitioners had sought a ruling that their fundamental human rights were violated through the governments decision to award free marks to all students for the three questions of the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination which are alleged to have been leaked. On September 20, an investigation was launched by the Department of Examinations after it was alleged that three questions of one of the question papers from the exam had been leaked. Later, the initial investigation report was handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which also launched a separate investigation into the matter. The investigations had uncovered that only three questions from the exam had been leaked in advance. However, the incident stirred controversy as a group of parents, holding press conferences and staging protests on several occasions, had claimed that the entire question paper had been leaked. Against this backdrop, the Director of the Planning Division of the National Institute of Education (NIE) in Maharagama and a school teacher, who were arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) over the question paper issue, were remanded until October 22. The arrested 58-year-old NIE Director was a member of the committee which prepared the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination paper, and the 49-year-old teacher had been conducting tuition classes for Grade 05 students. The parents raised the issue with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and as a result, the evaluation of the answer sheets for the scholarship examination was suspended until the investigation was completed. On October 14, the Commissioner General of Examinations Amith Jayasundara announced that it was decided not to re-conduct the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination. Furthermore, it had been decided to award free marks to all students for the 03 questions which were alleged to have been leaked. However in November, the Supreme Court issued an interim order preventing the release of results of the 2024 Grade 5 Scholarship Examination. SC Verdict by Adaderana Online on Scribd",

The island is precisely 8.5 hours ahead of India and 14 hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time. So when India clocked 3.30 pm today (Dec 31 2024), it was midnight, Wednesday, Jan 1, 2025, in Kiritimati.

As the time zones rolled on, the New Year spread across the globe, with each region bringing its unique traditions and celebrations to the occasion. Kiribatis timely ushering of 2025 showcases how the worlds varying time zones create a continuous stream of joy, with each place marking the arrival of the new year in its own way. Hawaii, American Samoa, and several US territories will join the celebrations much later, with the clock finally striking midnight for them in the early hours of January 1, 2025. With 38 different local times in use, it takes 26 hours for the New Year to encompass all time zones.

        "date": "December 31, 2024 09:50 pm",
        "content": "The former Army Commander and Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Shavendra Silva, has officially retired from the service today (31), concluding a remarkable 41-year career dedicated to safeguarding Sri Lankas security and sovereignty. A formal ceremony marking his retirement was held this afternoon (31) at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH). In a detailed statement issued ahead of his retirement, General Silva reflected on certain significant events that transpired during his tenure, including the civil unrest of 2022, also known as the Aragalaya protest movement. The civil unrest in the country in 2022 was a complex process in my military career that revealed who my true friends and true enemies are. The state army is an official armed force that stands ready to protect the people in the event of a threat to the state, whether external or internal, he stated. The 2022 uprising was an internal civil unrest. I ordered the army to use only minimal force to control the protesters. I did not want any ordinary innocent citizen to die from a military bullet. I was not eager to become a fanatical mass murderer wielding official authority against an unarmed population. The result is that the country did not descend into anarchy. An example of this is the negative consequences of military operations currently being carried out to suppress popular protests in neighboring states, he said. Addressing accusations leveled against him, General Silva rejected claims of personal ambitions. As power-hungry rulers claim, I did not have the obscene and evil purpose of overthrowing the state. Nor did I have the lowly desire to become a pawn of a foreign country or a pet of a foreign embassy. If that were the case, why would I have used the Air Force to rescue the Prime Minister, who was also the fifth Executive President of the country at the time, by dispersing protesters and saving his life? Why would I have driven away the majority of protesters who came to burn down the houses of politicians and saved those houses? Yet, the state rulers interpretation of my tactical strategies during the struggle was unfavorable to me, he noted. Reflecting on the latter part of his career, he explained, While serving as only the second Army Commander to hold the rank of four-star General in the history of the Sri Lankan military, I was seven months away from retiring from service on May 31, 2022, when the authorities officially transferred me from the post of Army Commander to Chief of Defence Staff. Shortly thereafter, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had to flee the country while I was attending a national security conference abroad with state permission, having resigned as Army Commander and serving as the Chief of Defence Staff, he added.",

Xi told Putin their countries will always move forward hand in hand, the official Xinhua News Agency said. China has maintained ties and robust trade with Russia since the latter invaded Ukraine in 2022, helping to offset Western sanctions and attempts to isolate Putin. Xi also addressed Taiwan, the self-ruled island claimed by Beijing: We Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same family. No one can ever sever the bond of kinship between us. In his address to the nation, Putin said Russia has set big goals for ourselves and achieved them, and we overcame difficulties more than once because we were together.

Syrians, meanwhile, expressed hope and uncertainty after the overthrow of leader Bashar Assad.

        "content": "The United States has imposed sanctions on two groups linked to Iranian and Russian efforts to target American voters with disinformation ahead of this years election. Treasury officials announced the sanctions Tuesday, alleging that the two organizations sought to stoke divisions among Americans before Novembers vote. U.S. intelligence has accused both governments of spreading disinformation, including fake videos, news stories and social media posts, designed to manipulate voters and undermine trust in U.S. elections. The governments of Iran and Russia have targeted our election processes and institutions and sought to divide the American people through targeted disinformation campaigns, Bradley T. Smith, Treasurys acting undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement. Authorities said the Russian group, the Moscow-based Center for Geopolitical Expertise, oversaw the creation, financing and dissemination of disinformation about American candidates, including deepfake videos created using artificial intelligence. In addition to the group itself, the new sanctions apply to its director, who authorities say worked closely with Russian military intelligence agents also overseeing cyberattacks and sabotage against the West. Authorities say the center used AI to quickly manufacture fake videos about American candidates created scores of fake news websites designed to look legitimate and even paid U.S. web companies to create pro-Russian content. The Iranian group, the Cognitive Design Production Center, is a subsidiary of Irans paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, U.S. officials said, which the United States has designated a foreign terrorist organization. Officials say the center worked since at least 2023 to incite political tensions in the United States. U.S. intelligence agencies have blamed the Iranian government for seeking to encourage protests in the U.S. over Israels war against Hamas in Gaza. Iran also has been accused of hacking into the accounts of several top current and former U.S. officials, including senior members of Donald Trumps campaign. In the months ahead of the election, U.S. intelligence officials said Russia, Iran and China all sought to undermine confidence in U.S. democracy. They also concluded that Russia sought to prop up the ultimate victor Trump, who has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggested cutting funds to Ukraine and repeatedly criticized the NATO military alliance. Iran, meanwhile, sought to oppose Trumps candidacy, officials said. The president-elects first administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act prompting Irans leaders to vow revenge. Russian and Iranian officials have rejected claims that they sought to influence the outcome of the 2024 election. Russia has not and does not interfere with the internal affairs of other countries, a spokesperson for Russias embassy in Washington wrote in an email Tuesday. A message left with officials from Iran was not immediately returned Tuesday. Source: AP --Agencies",

The IDL is an imaginary line across the Pacific Ocean that demarcates two consecutive calendar dates. In other words, for anyone crossing the lDL travelling East they will lose a day and for those going West, they will gain a day. These passengers will therefore leave Hong Kong in the early hours of New Years day and arrive in LA on New Years Eve. The IDL has no legal international status but is widely understood as the separation between Eastern and Western hemispheres.

        "date": "January 1, 2025 02:06 pm",
        "content": "The 20 Indian fishermen, who were released from jails in Sri Lanka, reached Chennai by flight, said officials in Chennai on Wednesday (Jan. 01). The fishermen were arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy a year ago. They are residents of the Tamil Nadu districts of Pudukkottai, Ramanathapuram, and Tuticorin, and were in Sri Lankan judicial custody. After negotiations between the Indian and Sri Lankan governments, the latter released the 20 fishermen. They were handed over to Indian embassy officials, who provided them with temporary citizenship certificates. The fishermen were then flown from Colombo to Chennai airport. Upon arrival at Chennai airport, the fishermen underwent citizenship verification, customs checks, and other formalities before being released. They were then greeted by fisheries department officials, who arranged for them to be taken to their hometowns in separate vehicles. It may be recalled that fishermen associations across Tamil Nadu have been organising large-scale protests in coastal districts following the regular arrests of fishermen from the state. They have written to the Indian Prime Minister, urging him to intervene and end the mid-sea arrests and seizures of mechanised boats, which form the backbone of the livelihoods of the fishermen. Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar had recently discussed this issue with visiting Sri Lankan President Anura Dissanayake, highlighting the frequent arrests of Tamil Nadu fishermen by the countrys Navy. Former Indian Minister Anbumani Ramadoss also called for strong intervention by the Centre to prevent further arrests of Indian fishermen. Thajudhin, General Secretary of the Tamil Nadu Meenavar Peravai, emphasized the growing hardships faced by fishermen and their families. The livelihood of our fishermen is under threat. Thousands of families who rely on fishing and related activities are facing severe hardship. A sense of fear has already gripped fishermen and their families about venturing out to sea, he said. Thajudhin also raised concerns about the Sri Lankan governments decision to nationalize seized mechanised fishing boats. This action will devastate the industry, as many fishermen have taken loans to purchase these expensive boats, expecting to repay them through their earnings, he explained. Fishermens associations across Tamil Nadu are organising large-scale protests across coastal districts, the Indian media reported. Source: IANS --Agencies",

        "content": "Sunita Williams, Indian-origin NASA astronaut along with her colleagues on the International Space Station (ISS), will have an extraordinary opportunity to welcome the New Year. Sunita Williams, currently in space, will see 16 sunrises and sunsets on New Year as the ISS, where she is located, keeps on the move. A post on X today from the space station handle read: As 2024 comes to a close today, the Exp 72 crew will see 16 sunrises and sunsets while soaring into the New Year. Seen here are several sunsets pictured over the years from the orbital outpost. Sunita Williams to see 16 sunrises and sunsets The Expedition team will observe 16 distinct sunrises and sunsets as they transition into 2025 while orbiting Earth at roughly 400 kilometers above. Williams is the commander of the Expedition 72 mission, which also hosts fellow flight engineers, namely - Alexey Ovchinin, Butch Wilmore, Ivan Vagner, Don Pettit, Aleksandr Gorbunov and Nick Hague. The number of sunrises the crew will see is estimated based on the number of times the ISS orbits the Earth, approximately 15.5 times per day. This is because it travels at an average speed of about 28,000 kilometres per hour (17,500 miles per hour) at an altitude of around 400 kilometres (250 miles). Each orbit takes roughly 90 minutes to complete. Sunita Williams New Year in space Sunita Williams, who started for the space station in June in Boeings Starliner spacecraft along with astronaut Barry Wilmore, and initially expected to be back in 9 days, had to spend Christmas at the space station too. What started as an eight-day mission on Boeings Starliner spacecraft had to be stretched owing to technical snag. Her return is now scheduled for March 2025. This extended duration enables her to experience multiple New Year celebrations, as the ISS completes an orbit approximately every 90 minutes. The crews New Year festivities will include special meals crafted from Earth-supplied fresh ingredients. They will maintain connections with their loved ones through video communications to support their emotional health during this extended mission. Williams has previously shared her enthusiasm about such distinctive experiences, referring to space as her happy place. The crew recently shared their Christmas greetings, demonstrating their festive spirit whilst stationed away from Earth. Aboard the ISS, the astronauts have embraced holiday customs, including decorations and special meal preparations, whilst continuing their vital scientific studies. As they anticipate welcoming 2025 multiple times, Williams and her fellow crew members exemplify the outstanding accomplishments in human space exploration. Williams and Mr Barrymore are now hoping to be back in March after yet another postponement by NASA. They were set to return in February 2025, but it was postponed due to the delay in SpaceXs Crew-10 mission, who have to relieve them. The Crew-9s two astronauts had arrived at the space station in late September, with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams. The plan was for all four to return home in February 2025.

        "content": "The Commissioner General of Examinations, Amith Jayasundara says a decision has been made to award free marks to all students for the three questions which were alleged to have been leaked in the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination, as per the recent Supreme Court order. On Tuesday (31), the Supreme Court declared that the fundamental human rights have been violated through the Cabinet of Ministers decision to award free marks to all students for the three questions of the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination which are alleged to have been leaked. Accordingly, the court also ordered the Commissioner General of Examinations to immediately implement a suitable recommendation out of the three recommendations made by the experts committee appointed to look into the matter. The three recommendations were; 1. Removing the compromised test items from scoring 2. Awarding free marks for all the candidates for the compromised questions 3. Re-administering a new test Issuing a statement today with this regard, the Commissioner General of Examinations stated that accordingly, following a thorough consideration of all pros and cons of the three recommendations made by the experts committee, it was decided that the second option was the most fair and the most suitable solution for the issue. Issuing the verdict on Tuesday, the Supreme Court had declared that both the provisions of the Constitution as well as the provisions of the Public Examinations Act would not empower either the Minister or the Secretary to the Ministry to participate in the decision-making process, issue directions to the Commissioner of Examinations, assume to themselves the decision-making power, or influence the process in a manner that would take away, curtail or inhibit the discretionary authority vested in the Commissioner of Examinations by the Public Examinations Act. This does not mean that the public functionary cannot engage in a process of consultation with the Minister or the Secretary, subject to the important caveat that the final decision must always be that of the public functionary who is required by law to take such decision, the court verdict reads. Furthermore, the Supreme Court had also stated that however, neither the authority vested in the Minister and the Secretary to engage in superintendence, nor the authority to supervise the functions of the Commissioner of Examinations would include legal authority to usurp the power vested in the Commissioner of Examinations and that similarly, the Commissioner of Examinations cannot abdicate expressly or impliedly either to the Minister or to the Secretary, the decision-making authority vested in him by law. During previous hearings, the court was informed that the Cabinet of Ministers had recommended to award free marks to all students for the 03 questions which were alleged to have been leaked in the 2024 Grade 5 Scholarship Examination.",
