Jude Chrysantha has accused Public Security Minister Tiran Alles of making false accusations regarding an alleged appeal made to the Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) on behalf of Fr. Cyril Gamini after a road accident. Convening a special press conference on Friday (22 Dec.) in his capacity as the Director of the Archdiocesan Commission for Social Communications, Fr. Chrysantha said that no such plea for help was made by Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith to Acting IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon. Speaking to the media in this regard, Fr. Chrysantha disclosed that the Cardinal had become aware of the incident only the following morning, suggesting that it was impossible for him to have contacted Tennakoon the night before seeking assistance. Minister Tiran Alles had recently claimed that the Cardinal appealed to Tennakoon for help following a road accident involving Fr. Gamini, who was subsequently taken to the police station. The lawmaker alleged that Fr. Cyril Gamini personally thanked the Acting IGP for his assistance. At the time of the incident, Fr. Cyril Gamini had no idea that someone would alert the Acting IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon of the matter, because by then he, Fr. Cyril Gamini, had already agreed to a settlement of sorts with the aggrieved party. Minister Tiran Alles claims, however, that the Father called the Acting IGP the next day, and thanked him. We urge Minister Tiran Alles to refrain from spreading such falsehoods, Fr. Jude Chrysantha charged, challenging the Minister to prove evidence, if any, with regards to the latter incident. Fr. Jude Chrysantha further pointed out that the Cardinal too, remains baffled as to who may have made the appeal on his behalf, as he the Cardinal has not vested any such powers within any individual or party.

        "content": "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Myanmar have continued to actively seek the assistance and cooperation of the Myanmar authorities on the safe repatriation of Sri Lankan nationals who have been trafficked to Myanmar. Issuing a statement in this regard, the Ministry noted that this situation has been an ongoing issue since 2022. As a result of the rescue and repatriation efforts spearheaded by the Consular Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Embassy in Myanmar and the Myanmar Government authorities, a total of 32 victims were rescued between 2022 and 2023. Given the grave nature of the situation, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry raised concerns on the safety of Sri Lankan nationals with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Myanmar Than Swe on the sidelines of BIMSTEC Foreign Ministers Retreat in Bangkok, Thailand. The Foreign Ministry officials continue to raise serious concerns on the safety of Sri Lankan nationals with the Myanmar Ambassador in Colombo and seek assistance and early intervention to secure their rescue and repatriation, the statement read. As per the information available to the Ministry, 56 Sri Lankan nationals are currently being held in the Myawaddy area in Myanmar. Thus, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs assured that all possible steps are being taken to liaise with Myanmar Government authorities and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to resolve this issue. However, the Myanmar Government has notified the Ministry of its difficulties in accessing that area due to prevailing situation. The statement further read: The Ministry has already taken action to inform and continuously engage with all stakeholders including, National Anti  Human Trafficking Task Force (NAHTTF), Criminal Investigation Department (CID), Human Trafficking, Smuggling Investigation and Maritime Crime Division, and the Department of Immigration  Emigration regarding this issue. On 19 December 2023, Sri Lankas Ambassador in Myanmar Janaka Bandara met Home Affairs Minister of Myanmar Lieutenant General Yar Pyae, and Director General Consular Affairs of the Foreign Ministry of Myanmar, U. Aung Kyaw Oo, in Nay Pyi Taw. During the meeting the Ambassador requested for urgent assistance from the Myanmar Government to rescue the Sri Lankan nationals who were trafficked. It is learnt that the job offers are mainly in the IT sector and Sri Lankan nationals travel to Myanmar using visit visas, instead of work visas and contracts. These workers travel to Myanmar, without registering with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been requesting all Sri Lankan nationals, seeking job opportunities in the Southeast Asia region not to fall prey to human trafficking and criminal syndicates who offer large salaries without proper job contracts and work visas. The Ministry will continue to seek all possible avenues to ensure the safety and security of our nationals and seek early repatriation in consultation with the Government of Myanmar",

        "content": "SriLankan Airlines has expanded its fleet with the addition of a newly leased Airbus A320 aircraft, identified by the serial number 4R  ABS, bringing the total number of aircraft in its fleet to 22. Leased for a period of six years, the aircraft arrived in Colombo from Malaysia on Thursday night (21 Dec.), and is set to enter service promptly after customization and branding. Its inaugural flight is scheduled to take place on 29 December, to the Maldives. The Airbus A320 is equipped with Sharklet wingtips, contributing to reduced drag and increased fuel efficiency, and will primarily serve on short and medium-haul routes covering the Indian subcontinent, the Far East, and the Middle East. Featuring a configuration of 12 Business Class seats and 138 Economy Class seats, the 4R  ABS will enable the national carrier to enhance its seating capacity on these routes. As of now, SriLankan Airlines operates 12 narrow-bodied aircraft and 10 wide-bodied aircraft. Despite the challenges faced by the airline industry throughout the year, including shortages of available aircraft and engines along with supply chain issues, this addition marks the beginning of a fleet expansion. By the start of January 2024, SriLankan anticipates three more aircrafts to join its fleet, including a wet leased A330 and the arrival of two additional engines. Another sister aircraft to 4R  ABS is also expected to be delivered in March 2024. SriLankan Airlines presently operates direct flights between Colombo and 36 cities in 21 countries and is a member of the OneWorld Alliance.",

        "date": "December 23, 2023 03:37 am",
        "content": "The Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara, highlighted the significant improvement in the countrys foreign reserves under the leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. According to Minister Nanayakkara, the foreign reserve was depleted when the current government assumed office, but it has successfully rebounded, reaching a noteworthy USD 3.6 billion. Minister Nanayakkara underscored the challenges faced by the government in making decisions that resonate with the public, emphasizing that the pursuit of popular choices often led to setbacks for the nation. He pointed out that despite the inherent difficulties, the government has managed to overcome obstacles and steer the country towards economic stability. The ministers remarks were made during the Collective Path to a Stable Country media briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre today (22 Dec.). Minister Manusha Nanayakkara further commented: Politicians are often expected to make decisions that resonate with the public, as popular choices tend to garner widespread support. However, there had a pattern of groups including us, protesting against these kinds of popular decisions. But unfortunately, such kind of approaches has led the country into economic turmoil. Even the opposition cannot escape criticism, as they have protested against decisions aimed at national development, dismissing them as mere populism. It is essential to acknowledge that such actions contribute to the countrys economic downfall. In our case, when we assumed office, the country faced a severe economic crisis with no foreign reserves. Expatriate workers possessed more assets than the Central Banks dollar reserves. Despite the challenges, the government successfully increased foreign reserves to USD 3.6 billion, preventing a collapse due to a lack of dollars for imports. Upon taking office, rampant money printing had led to inflation. We addressed this issue and stabilized the exchange rate, reducing the value of the dollar from Rs. 365 to 320. This prevented people from resorting to the black market for foreign currency transactions, ensuring accessibility for education and international transactions. The government also tackled high-interest rates, lowering them from over 25 to a single-digit figure within a year and a half. This allowed the country to secure loans from banks and foster economic growth. In the past, the country experienced negative economic growth, but now we have achieved positive growth. The agriculture, industry and tourism sectors have all seen significant improvements compared to the previous year. Efforts have been made to address public demands for systemic change. Tax collection has been streamlined, ensuring that everyone pays their fair share. Emigrants are also contributing significantly through substantial taxes paid in their host countries. Building a country cannot solely rely on tax concessions, as witnessed in the Samrudhi initiative. The government has initiated operations against the underworld and drug trafficking, although these efforts are criticized as mere media shows. Numerous policy decisions have been implemented to bring about the desired systemic changes. A program emphasizing respect for labour has been launched and the country is undergoing a digital transformation.",

        "content": "French authorities grounded a flight from the United Arab Emirates to Nicaragua carrying 303 Indian passengers after receiving a tip that it could be carrying victims of human trafficking, prosecutors said Friday. Special investigators are questioning all those aboard and two people are in custody pending further examination, the Paris prosecutors office said in a statement. The prosecutors office said an anonymous tip signaled that the flight, operated by small Romania-based charter company Legend Airlines, was carrying people who could be victims of human trafficking. It was grounded Thursday after it stopped for refueling at the Vatry Airport east of Paris, a small airfield in the middle of Champagne country used primarily for charter and cargo flights. The passengers and crew are sequestered in the small Vatry airport, where they will spend a second night Friday on camp cots while the investigation continues, according to an official with the Marne regional administration. They initially remained in the A340 plane, surrounded by police on the tarmac, but were then transferred into the main hall of the airport to sleep Thursday night, the official said. Investigators from a specialized French organized crime unit, border police and aviation gendarmes are working on the case. The Indian Embassy in France posted on X that embassy staff had obtained consular access to the passengers. We are investigating the situation and ensuring the well-being of passengers. Legend Airlines did not respond to requests for comment. Liliana Bakayoko, identified as a Legend Airlines lawyer, said on Frances BFM television that the company denies any role in eventual human trafficking. She said a customer, whom she wouldnt identify, chartered the plane and was responsible for verifying the identity documents of each passenger. The customer communicated the passenger information to the airline 48 hours before the flight, she said. Source: ABC News",

        "content": "Three suspects have been arrested over the trafficking of Sri Lankans to Myanmar. The arrests were made in Wattala and Trincomalee areas. Earlier this week, reports revealed that a group of 56 Sri Lankan nationals are currently being held captive by a terror group in Myanmars Myaweddi area, which is infested with cybercrimes under the grip of an armed group. Lured with tourist visas behind the false front of lucrative job offers in the IT sector, these Sri Lankans had illegally entered Myanmar through its border with Thailand. The Sri Lankans forcibly detained at the terrorist camp in Myaweddi are reported to be working as cyber slaves forced to commit internet scams. The Sri Lankans, who fell victim to this scam, have said that they were initially unaware of the cybercrime camp. Despite initially being told that they would be doing jobs such as data entry, these Sri Lankans have been forced to appear as romantic partners to foreigners, especially Europeans and Americans, in order to steal their money. When they refuse to do as told, the captives are reportedly subjected to acts of torture, which they said include electrocution, waterboarding in cages, hanging them by their hands and starving. On Friday (Dec.22), the Foreign Affairs Ministry said it has, together with the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Myanmar, have continued to actively seek the assistance and cooperation of the Myanmar authorities on the safe repatriation of the Sri Lankan nationals who have been trafficked to Myanmar. According to the ministry, this situation has been going on since 2022. As a result of the rescue and repatriation efforts spearheaded by the Consular Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Embassy in Myanmar and the Myanmar Government authorities, a total of 32 victims have been rescued between 2022 and 2023.

        "date": "December 23, 2023 12:59 pm",
        "content": "The U.N. Security Council called for boosting humanitarian assistance for Gaza, but the U.N. chief said the way Israel was conducting its military operation was creating massive obstacles to aid distribution inside the battered enclave. After days of wrangling to avert a threatened U.S. veto, the Security Council on Friday passed a resolution urging steps to allow safe, unhindered, and expanded humanitarian access to Gaza and conditions for a sustainable cessation of fighting. The resolution was toned down from earlier drafts that called for an immediate end to 11 weeks of war and diluting Israeli control over aid deliveries, clearing the way for the vote in which the United States, Israels main ally, abstained. Washington repeatedly has backed Israels right to self-defense following the Oct. 7 rampage into Israel by Gazas ruling Hamas militants, who killed 1,200 people and took 240 hostages back into the enclave. Gilad Erdan, Israels U.N. ambassador, said the Security Council should have focused more on freeing the hostages and that concentrating on aid mechanisms was unnecessary as Israel permits aid deliveries at the required scale. Hamas and the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority split over the measure, with the former saying it was insufficient to meet the stricken enclaves needs and defied international calls for an end to Israels aggression. The authoritys foreign ministry welcomed the resolution as a step that would help end the aggression, ensure the arrival of aid and protect the Palestinian people. The United States and Israel, which has vowed to eradicate Hamas, oppose a ceasefire, contending it would allow the Islamist militant group to regroup and rearm. U.S. President Joe Bidens administration, however, has grown increasingly critical of the mounting casualty toll and humanitarian crisis that has worsened as Israel presses on with its ground and air offensive. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the way Israel is conducting its operation is creating massive obstacles to the distribution of humanitarian assistance in Gaza, where the United Nations says the aid available is just 10 percent of what is needed. Israel says 5,405 aid trucks - bearing food, water and medical supplies - have entered Gaza since the war started. The latest casualty update from Gazas health ministry said 20,057 Palestinians have been killed and 53,320 wounded in the Israeli offensive that has destroyed huge swaths of the enclave and displaced most of the population of 2.3 million. Israel says 140 of its soldiers have been killed since it launched its ground incursion on Oct. 20. LATE NIGHT AIRSTRIKES, SHELLING Air strikes, artillery bombardments and fighting were reported across Gaza late into Friday night, as hopes dimmed for an imminent breakthrough in talks in Egypt aimed at getting warring Israel and Hamas to agree to a new truce. Israels military ordered residents of Al-Bureij, in central Gaza, to move south immediately. The directive signaled a new focus of the ground assault that has devastated the enclaves north and made a series of incursions in the south. Some residents packed up donkey carts and left. But there was no immediate sign of large numbers from Al-Bureij joining the hundreds of thousands fleeing other areas. Where should we go to? There is no place safe, Ziad, a medic and father of six, told Reuters by phone. They ask people to head to (the central Gaza city of) Deir Al-Balah, where they bomb day and night. An Israeli air strike on a house in Nusseirat refugee camp killed three people including a journalist of Hamas Aqsa TV channel and two relatives, health officials and Hamas media said. The reporters death would bring to at least 69 the number of journalists killed in the conflict, according to a tally by the Committee to Protect Journalists. In the south, at least four civilians died in an air strike on a car in Rafah, a Palestinian rescue worker said. A boy, his face covered in blood, and a girl, were carried away, video showed. There was no immediate Israeli comment. Israels indiscriminate strikes on Gaza have turned the north of the Strip into a pile of rubble, medical charity MSF said in a post on X. In Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, south Gaza, the dead and wounded continue to arrive almost every day... Nowhere is safe. The official Palestinian news agency WAFA said at least 18 Palestinians were killed and dozens others wounded in an air strike on a house in Nuseirat, central Gaza, late Friday night. The Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but has blamed Iran-backed Hamas for operating in densely populated areas or using civilians as human shields, an allegation the group denies. Hamas-affiliated Shehab news agency reported heavy shelling and air strikes on Jabalia al-Balad and Jabalia refugee camp, in northern Gaza, and said that Israeli vehicles were trying to advance from the western side of Jabalia amid the sound of gunfire. WAFA reported that Israeli shelling destroyed a water desalination plant in Jabalia by the Al Amal Hospital. Biden said on Friday he and his wife, Jill, were heartbroken by the news that Gad Haggai, a 73-year-old American-Israeli, is believed to have been killed by Hamas in its Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Haggais wife, Judith Weinstein, is still being held hostage in Gaza, according to Israeli media outlet Haaretz. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "December 23, 2023 02:07 pm",
        "content": "The number of new COVID cases increased by 52 during the past four-odd weeks, the WHO said, with over 850,000 new cases reported during the period. The number of new deaths decreased by 8 per cent as compared to the previous 28-day period, with over 3,000 new fatalities reported, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in its latest press release. As of December 17, over 772 million confirmed cases and nearly seven million deaths have been reported globally since the onset of COVID-19, the WHO noted. Further, the WHO said over 118,000 new COVID-19 hospitalisations and over 1600 new intensive care unit (ICU) admissions have been recorded, with an overall increase of 23 per cent and 51 per cent, respectively, globally. As of December 18, 2023, JN.1, a sub-lineage of BA.2.86 Omicron variant has been designated a separate variant of interest (VOI) apart from its parent lineage BA.2.86 due to its rapid increase in prevalence in recent weeks. Globally, EG.5 remains the most reported variant of interest. Due to its rapidly increasing spread, WHO is classifying the variant JN.1 as a separate variant of interest (VOI) from the parent lineage BA.2.86. It was previously classified as VOI as part of BA.2.86 sublineages. Based on the available evidence, the additional global public health risk posed by JN.1 is currently evaluated as low. Despite this, with the onset of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, JN.1 could increase the burden of respiratory infections in many countries. The WHO had earlier said it was continuously monitoring the evidence and would update the JN.1 risk evaluation as needed. Current vaccines continue to protect against severe disease and death from JN.1 and other circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, it noted. COVID-19 is not the only respiratory disease circulating. Influenza, RSV, and common childhood pneumonia are also on the rise. The WHO advises people to take measures to prevent infections and severe disease using all available tools. These include wearing a mask when in crowded, enclosed, or poorly ventilated areas, keeping a safe distance from others, practising respiratory etiquette (covering coughs and sneezes), cleaning hands regularly, and getting tested if one has any symptoms or if you might have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 or influenza.

        "date": "December 23, 2023 09:40 pm",
        "content": "For the first time since 1917, Ukraine is celebrating Christmas on 25 December. The move is more than just a change of date from 7 January - the date for Christmas in the Julian calendar, which Russia uses. Its the continuation of a significant cultural shift in the country - the latest attempt to eradicate Moscows influence in Ukraine. The adoption of the Western, Gregorian calendar is also a sign of Kyivs continuing bid to align itself with Europe. Whether in war or peacetime, Christmas always comes. Klavdievo-Tarasoves decorations factory, in a small town outside Kyiv, used to be one of three which supplied the whole of the Soviet Union. We used to have many people - not any more, Leokadia tells us. Shes worked on this production line since 1978. She effortlessly blows glass baubles using a gas burner fixed to her desk. Its a welcome source of heat in these cold, industrial surroundings. After years of shrinking output, this factory stopped completely when Russian forces occupied this area for a month soon after the start of the countrys full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. It was very scary when tanks drove down the street, Henya, another worker, explains. We couldnt go outside. We had no information, we were cut off from the world. It was terrible. And yet, despite only a third of the team having returned, decorations are still being made. Small pieces of Christmas cheer are carefully built and sent out around the country. And what is Henyas wish for Ukrainians living under Russian occupation this Christmas? You have to believe, hope - and liberation will happen, it will be like that. Henya works on the more artistic part of the process: she and her colleagues caringly hand paint each individual bauble. You immediately notice a military theme. Miniature soldiers, MIG fighter jets, even a Ukrainian tractor pulling a Russian tank - all hang from a shelf, destined for a Christmas tree. I think that everyone who will take a look at such a bauble will hope for the victory of our country sooner, says Tamila with a defiant tone now typical here in Ukraine. Ukraine and Russia share countless cultural ties, and they will always have to live next to each other. Yet the formers identity is only being strengthened by the latters aggression. Fewer places know that aggression better than the town of Bucha, a couple of miles from the decoration factory. As the Russian advance towards Kyiv slowed last year, invading troops were accused of killing more than 500 civilians in one of the worst atrocities of the war so far. Some of their names appear on a silver memorial next to the Church of St Andrew. As its golden domes glisten in the winter sunshine, you can still see where grass has struggled to regrow. It was here that a mass grave appeared during Russias occupation. The bodies of those who died could only be exhumed after they retreated. Unfortunately for many people in the world, Ukraine is linked to Russia. And Ukraine is always viewed in the context of being a neighbour of Russia, explains Father Andriy in the candlelit crypt of St Andrews. But I think that we are more a neighbour of Europe, he says. And the fact that weve now changed the calendar is not shifting away from Russia. It is us returning back to Europe, where we belong. Given Russia will always be close by, I ask whether he could ever forgive the invading country for what its done to his homeland. God forgives a sinner, but only those who repent. We do not see yet that the Russians are trying to repent for their sins and mistakes, so I think its too early to talk about forgiveness. For Ukraine, any Russian repentance must start with an end of its ongoing invasion. There is still no sign of that happening. Source - BBC - Agencies",

Accordingly, a total of 16 inmates of the Matara prison currently receive treatment at the Matara Hospital, while another inmate was reported dead on Saturday, after being admitted to the hospital. Dissanayake mentioned that two of them are still receiving treatment at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Matara Hospital. On Friday (Dec. 22), a group of inmates at the Matara Prison was reported to have been hospitalized after falling ill. Accordingly, eight inmates were admitted to the hospital due to high fever. In response, several precautionary measures were implemented within the prison to control the potential spread of the virus, the Media Spokesman of the Department of Prisons assured. Later on Saturday, an inmate was reported to have succumbed to an illness, which was presumed to be brain fever. The inmate had been convicted of murder on 30 August, and imprisoned. Meanwhile it was reported that as a preventive step, all new inmates slated to serve their sentences at Matara Prison would be redirected to Angunakolapelessa Prison, following directives from the Commissioner General of Prisons. Against this backdrop, the defence authorities pointed out that although December 24 and 25 were been declared as special days for visiting prisoners, steps will be taken to limit the permission granted to visit the inmates at Matara Prison. The health authorities of the Department of Prisons have reportedly decided to take special care in the process of releasing prisoners in view of Christmas Day. Furthermore, it is reported that several other inmates with fever are still staying in the Matara prison. The prison officials stated that steps will be taken to hospitalize the relevant inmates today (Dec. 24).",

        "date": "December 24, 2023 05:55 pm",
        "content": "Thirteen workers were killed and 46 injured on Sunday in a fire at a nickel smelter furnace owned by Indonesia Tsingshan Stainless Steel (ITSS) on Sulawesi island, the owner of the industrial park where the smelter is located said. The fire occurred when workers repaired the furnace and installed plates at 5:30 a.m. on Sunday (2130 GMT on Saturday), killing nine Indonesian workers and four Chinese workers, Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park (IMIP) said in a statement. The fire was extinguished at 9:10 a.m. local time, it added. It had said earlier that an explosion killed eight Indonesian and five Chinese workers. The furnace was shut off the day before to prepare for maintenance, IMIP said, but during the maintenance process excess iron slag flowed from the furnace. The furnace walls then collapsed and the remaining iron slag flowed out, causing a fire and resulting in some workers at the location suffering injuries and even fatalities, IMIP spokesperson Dedy Kurniawan said in the statement. The workers were injured by hot steam from stainless steel slag and the burning fire, Dedy told a separate interview with local station Metro TV. There was no explosion or oxygen canister on site, he said, revising the companys earlier statement. IMIP is a nickel-focused industrial park owned by Chinas Tsingshan and its local partner Bintang Delapan Group, which produce stainless steel and carbon steel. ITSS is one of the tenants at the industrial park, IMIP said. IMIP will coordinate with related parties to investigate the incident and cover all treatment costs for victims, the company said. Nickel has become increasingly crucial for resource-rich Indonesia, the worlds biggest nickel producer, with billions of dollars of global investment flowing in after the government banned exports of unprocessed ore in 2020. Southeast Asias biggest economy is trying develop downstream nickel industries and lure big-ticket investment from manufacturers of electric vehicles and their batteries. However, several fatal accidents have occurred in Indonesias nickel processing industry in recent years. President Joko Widodo is keen to develop the sector but has also called for improvements in safety and has pledged to enhance the monitoring of environmental standards. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

This year, Christmas is celebrated amidst a backdrop of numerous challenges, Wickremesinghe said highlighting the importance of concentrating on the authentic significance of Jesus Christs birth in a manger, which is embodied by the theme sharing a meal with the less fortunate. The Head of State also noted that the true significance of Christmas is the spiritual transformation within us. Attached below is President Wickremesinghes message for Christmas Day: Christmas represents the celebration of hope. The individuals who traversed in obscurity, burdened with tears and sighs, have witnessed a profound light. In the pursuit of revitalizing that hope, I extend my wishes for all of us to conscientiously fulfil our responsibilities and duties, fostering a Christmas that instils fresh hopes in our nation. Amid our celebratory mood, it is crucial to maintain focus on the authentic significance of Jesus Christs birth in a manger, encapsulated by the theme Sharing a meal with the less fortunate. Christmas serves as a reminder of the birth of Jesus Christ, who, in self-sacrifice on the cross, redeemed humanity from sin. Guided by Christian teachings, we are urged to forgive those who oppose us, those who have wronged us and to relinquish all feelings of animosity and resentment. While the external festivities of Christmas may be apparent, I posit that its true significance remains elusive unless accompanied by a profound spiritual transformation within us. This year, as we commemorate Christmas amidst a backdrop of numerous challenges burdening our society, I extend an invitation to everyone to unite in shouldering their responsibilities, recognizing the genuine adversities confronting our nation.

        "date": "December 25, 2023 09:16 am",
        "content": "One of Chinas most powerful earthquakes in recent years killed at least 149 people in a remote northwestern region, according to state media, with two people still missing after the magnitude 6.2 temblor hit a week ago. The epicentre of the quake straddled the provinces of Gansu and Qinghai in an area where many of Chinas Hui people, a tight-knit ethnic minority characterised by its distinctive Muslim identity, are found. Gansu bore the brunt of the quakes wrath. More than 200,000 homes were wrecked and 15,000 were on the brink of collapse, Chinese state media reported. Displacing 145,000 people, the powerful tremors killed 117 people in the province as of Dec. 22, with 781 wounded. In Qinghai west of Gansu, 32 people died and two remained missing as of 11 p.m. (1500 GMT) on Sunday, according to state media. Local authorities attributed the severity of the damage to the shallowness of the quake. The thrust-type rupture of the earthquake and the relatively soft sedimentary rock in the region also amplified the destructive power of the tremors. Many of the homes destroyed were built from an earlier era, made of earth-wood or brick-wood structures. Their load-bearing walls were constructed from earth, resulting in their poor defences against any earthquake, local authorities said. The tragedy has highlighted the urgency of raising the earthquake resistance of rural homes, they added. Earthquakes are common in provinces on the northeastern boundary of the tectonically active Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, comprising most of Tibet, Qinghai, Gansu, parts of Xinjiang and the rugged highlands in the west of Sichuan. Ten years ago in Sichuan, more than 6,700 people were injured and over 160 were killed in a magnitude 6.6 earthquake. In 2010, a destructive magnitude 7.1 quake killed 2,700 people in Yushu, a largely Tibetan area in Qinghai. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "date": "December 25, 2023 11:48 am",
        "content": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) has urged countries in South-East Asia to strengthen surveillance in view of the increasing cases of respiratory diseases, including due to COVID-19 and its new sub-variant JN.1, and influenza. The WHO also urged people to take protective measures. The COVID-19 virus continues to evolve, change, and circulate in all countries globally. While current evidence suggests the additional public health risk posed by JN.1 is low, we must continue to track the evolution of these viruses to tailor our response. For this, countries must strengthen surveillance and sequencing, and ensure sharing of data, said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO South-East Asia. WHO has classified JN.1 as a variant of interest following its rapid global spread. In recent weeks, JN.1 was reported in multiple countries, and its prevalence has been rapidly increasing globally. Considering the limited available evidence, the additional public health risk posed by JN.1 is currently evaluated as low at the global level, Singh said. It is anticipated that this variant may cause an increase in COVID-19 cases amid surge of infections of other viral and bacterial infections, especially in countries entering the winter season. As people travel and gather for festivities during the holiday season, spending a lot of time together indoors where poor ventilation facilitates transmission of viruses that cause respiratory diseases, they must take protective measures and seek timely clinical care when unwell, said Dr Khetrapal Singh. The regional director also emphasised on the importance of vaccination against COVID-19 and influenza, especially for people at high risk. All WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccines continue to protect against severe diseases and deaths from all variants including JN.1, she said. In May, following sustained decline in the trajectory of COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths, and high levels of population immunity to SARS-CoV2, WHO declared that COVID-19 no longer constituted a public health emergency of international concern. While considerable progress has been made in establishing and strengthening a global system to detect and rapidly assess risks posed by SARS-CoV2, testing and reporting of COVID-19 cases has decreased. With COVID-19 continuing to circulate at high levels globally, countries must strengthen surveillance, sequencing, and reporting to effectively manage respiratory diseases and to protect peoples health, the regional director said.

        "content": "A new programme to raise awareness about tsunami dangers will commence from tomorrow in view of the National Safety Day, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) announced. The Director General of Disaster Management Centre, Major General (Retd) Sudantha Ranasinghe said the relevant awareness programme will be carried out by using a caller tune ringtone of mobile phones. Tomorrow (Dec. 26) marks the 19th anniversary of the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami, one of the worlds deadliest and most destructive natural disasters, which impacted over 10 countries in the Indian Ocean. Thus, a two minutes silence will be observed islandwide tomorrow from 9.25 a.m. to 9.27 a.m. in memory of all who lost their lives in the 2004 tsunami and other natural disasters in Sri Lanka, as per the DMC. A powerful undersea megathrust earthquake, which registered a magnitude of 9.1, struck off the coast of Sumatra Island, Indonesia on a Sunday morning, 26th of December 2004. About 20 minutes after the shock, Indonesias capital Banda Aceh, which was closest to the epicentre of the earthquake, was devastated by massive 100-foot waves, claiming the lives of more than 100,000. A series of turbulent waves then ravaged the coasts of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Maldives, Myanmar and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. In all, deaths from the disaster mounted over 230,000 in a matter of hours. Sri Lanka was one of the hardest-hit countries with over 40,000 fatalities and property damage worth several million rupees. Thousands were left homeless as waves pushed debris several kilometres inland, pounding buildings into rubble. Since 2005, the 26th of December has been declared as National Safety Day and on that day commemoration events are held as a continuous national event each year, with the participation of the political leadership in remembrance of all those who lost their lives in the country due to the various natural disasters including the tsunami disaster.",

        "date": "December 25, 2023 01:24 pm",
        "content": "Many Ukrainian Orthodox Christians are preparing to celebrate Christmas on 25 December for the first time this year. Ukraine has traditionally used the Julian calendar, also used by Russia, where Christmas falls on 7 January. In a further shift from Russia, it is now marking Christmas according to the Western - or Gregorian - calendar, which it uses in everyday life. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky changed the law in July, saying it allowed Ukrainians to abandon the Russian heritage of celebrating Christmas in January. In a Christmas message issued on Sunday evening, Mr Zelensky said all Ukrainians were now together. We all celebrate Christmas together. On the same date, as one big family, as one nation, as one united country. In the capital Kyiv, married couple Lesia Shestakova, a Catholic, and Oleksandr Shestakov, who is Orthodox, are celebrating Christmas together. The pair - who until now marked Christmas twice, with their respective parents - attended the Sunday morning service at the citys Catholic cathedral (pictured above). There is finally a day in Ukraine which my husband and I can spend together in the cathedral and thank God that we are together, alive and in good health, Lesia told Reuters news agency. The Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU), a newly created independent church that held its first service in 2019, has also changed its Christmas date to 25 December. It formally broke away from the Russian Orthodox church over Moscows annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. People prayed and lit candles across the country on Sunday. In the western city of Lviv, which has been little damaged by the war, children in traditional costumes sang carols and took part in festive processions on the streets. In recent years many worshippers have joined the OCU but millions still follow the historically Russia-linked Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC), and so will continue to celebrate Christmas on 7 January. The UOC says that in 2022 it split from Moscow because of Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine although many people remain sceptical. And of course there are expected to be quite a few Ukrainians who will be celebrating twice - the more the merrier. Source - BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "December 25, 2023 04:49 pm",
        "content": "Major Japanese auto manufacturers will invest 150 billion baht (4.34 billion) in Thailand over the next five years, a Thai government spokesperson said on Monday, supporting the Southeast Asian countrys transition to making electric vehicles. Toyota Motor and Honda Motor will invest about 50 billion baht each, while Isuzu Motors will invest 30 billion baht and Mitsubishi Motors 20 billion baht, spokesperson Chai Wacharoke said, adding this would include the production of electric pickup trucks. Thailands Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin concluded a trip to Japan last week. Southeast Asias second-largest economy is the largest car producer and exporter in the region. Japanese manufacturers have dominated the Thai auto sector for decades, but Chinese EV makers have recently been making large investments. The investment by the Japanese automakers will support the governments policy of transitioning from combustion engine vehicles to EVs, Chai said. Toyota, Honda, Isuzu and Mitsubishi did not respond immediately to requests for comment. Thailand is aiming to convert about a third of its annual production of 2.5 million vehicles into EVs by 2030 and is preparing incentives to encourage more investment and conversion into EV manufacturing. Tax cuts and subsidies rolled out by Thailand have already drawn a raft of Chinese carmakers, including BYD and Great Wall Motor, which have committed to investing 1.44 billion in new production facilities in the country. Srettha this month showed executives from U.S. EV maker Tesla industrial estates in Thailand for potential investment.",

        "date": "December 25, 2023 05:00 pm",
        "content": "Reliance Industries, Indias most valuable company, and Walt Disney signed a non-binding term sheet to merge their Indian media operations, the Economic Times reported on Monday, citing sources it did not name. Under the merger Reliance would own 51 through a combination of shares and cash, with Disney holding the remaining 49, giving more control to Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambanis Reliance group, the newspaper said. The deal is likely to be completed by February, with Reliance aiming to finish the process by the end of January, subject to regulatory approvals, it said. Reliance and Disney did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Reuters reported two weeks ago that company executives were meeting in London to discuss the next stage of the media merger. A merger would create one of Indias biggest entertainment empires, competing with television interests such as Zee Entertainment and Sony, and streaming giants including Netflix and Amazon Prime. Reliance runs many TV channels and the JioCinema streaming app through its media and entertainment unit Viacom18. Ambani has been locked in a fierce battle with Disney, offering free streaming of the Indian Premier League cricket tournament, whose digital rights were once with Disney in India. This has sparked a user exodus from Disneys streaming app Hotstar in recent quarters. Since early this year, Disney has been exploring a sale or joint venture partnership for its India business, which includes many TV channels. The proposed deal would create a unit under Reliances Viacom18 to take control of Star India through a stock swap, the Economic Times said. The parties are working on a plan to invest 1 billion to 1.5 billion in the business, it said, without specifying whether this was the total or the amount each would invest. The board is expected to include an equal number of directors from Reliance and Disney, with at least two representatives each, the newspaper said. They are also in consideration of having at least two independent directors, but this might change in the coming weeks, the report said. Source - Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "The Ministry of Health says that according to data presently available, the pandemic spread of the new Covid-19 sub-strain JN-1 is minimal in Sri Lanka. Issuing a statement on Monday (Dec. 25), the Ministry of Health stated that based on the tests carried out for the past couple of months, there has been a very low number of Covid-19 cases reported. Meanwhile the countrys health officials have taken measures to obtain samples from the main hospitals across the island with special attention to the duration of the last few days and in accordance with the relevant technical instructions, and have sent them to the Medical Research Institute for testing, the statement mentioned, adding that none of the samples tested positive for COVID-19. The Ministry of Health further emphasized in the statement that as per the experts advice, in order to prevent the spread of respiratory diseases including COVID-19 and Influenza it is advised to wear masks in closed, poor-ventilated and crowded places, wash hands frequently, maintain social distancing, and maintaining cough and sneeze etiquette. In the meantime, people over the age of 60 with chronic illnesses and pregnant mothers are at increased risk of complications if they suffer from respiratory diseases, therefore such individuals are requested to remain especially careful, it added. Against this backdrop, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has urged countries in South-East Asia to strengthen surveillance in view of the increasing cases of respiratory diseases, including COVID-19 and its new sub-variant JN.1, and influenza. The WHO also urged people to take protective measures. WHO has classified JN.1 as a variant of interest following its rapid global spread. In recent weeks, JN.1 was reported in multiple countries, and its prevalence has been rapidly increasing globally.",

        "content": "The Human Trafficking, Human Smuggling, and Maritime Crimes Division of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has initiated two special investigations into the incident of cyber slavery involving a group of Sri Lankans in Myanmar, said Sri Lanka Police. Police Media Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa stated that investigations are underway regarding 04 suspects including three Sri Lankans and a Chinese national based on four complaints received by the police. Ada Derana recently revealed an incident of 56 Sri Lankans being forcibly detained in a Burmese terrorist camp and put to work as cyber slaves. Reportedly, Sri Lankan youths are facing this tragedy since 2022, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had previously rescued 32 such Sri Lankans on several occasions. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already sought the assistance of Sri Lankan Embassy in Yangon to rescue the Sri Lankans who are currently in cyber slavery in Myanmar. Against this backdrop, the police urge the public to avoid going abroad for work on tourist visas. On Sunday, the CID revealed that three persons who had been engaged in the trafficking of Sri Lankans to Myanmar had been identified through investigations. The trio was said to be the residents of Aralaganwila, Wathuregama and Dorathiyawa areas, and have fled the areas by now.",

        "content": "A two minutes silence will be observed island-wide today (26 December) on National Safety Day from 9.25 a.m. to 9.27 a.m. in memory of all who lost their lives in the 2004 tsunami and other natural disasters in Sri Lanka, the Disaster Management Center (DMC) said. Meanwhile the DMC says a new programme to raise awareness about tsunami dangers will commence from today in view of the National Safety Day. The Director General of Disaster Management Centre, Major General (Retd) Sudantha Ranasinghe said the relevant awareness programme will be carried out by using a caller tune ringtone for mobile phones. Today (Dec. 26) marks the 19th anniversary of the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami, one of the worlds deadliest and most destructive natural disasters, which impacted over 10 countries in the Indian Ocean. Thus, a two minutes silence will be observed island-wide today from 9.25 a.m. to 9.27 a.m. in memory of all who lost their lives in the 2004 tsunami and other natural disasters in Sri Lanka, as per the DMC. A powerful undersea megathrust earthquake, which registered a magnitude of 9.1, struck off the coast of Sumatra Island, Indonesia on a Sunday morning, 26th of December 2004. About 20 minutes after the shock, Indonesias capital Banda Aceh, which was closest to the epicentre of the earthquake, was devastated by massive 100-foot waves, claiming the lives of more than 100,000. A series of turbulent waves then ravaged the coasts of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Maldives, Myanmar and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. In all, deaths from the disaster mounted over 230,000 in a matter of hours. Sri Lanka was one of the hardest-hit countries with over 40,000 fatalities and property damage worth several million rupees. Thousands were left homeless as waves pushed debris several kilometres inland, pounding buildings into rubble. Since 2005, the 26th of December has been declared as National Safety Day and on that day commemoration events are held as a continuous national event each year, with the participation of the political leadership in remembrance of all those who lost their lives in the country due to the various natural disasters including the tsunami disaster.",

        "date": "December 26, 2023 04:00 pm",
        "content": "Japans SLIM space probe has entered the moons orbit in a major step towards the countrys first successful lunar landing, expected next month. The Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) is nicknamed the Moon Sniper because it is designed to land within 100 metres (328 feet) of a specific target on the lunar surface. If successful, the touchdown would make Japan only the fifth country to have successfully landed a probe on the Moon, after the United States, Russia, China and India. On Monday, SLIM successfully entered the moons orbit at 04.51pm Japan time, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) said in a statement. Its trajectory shift was achieved as originally planned, and there is nothing out of the ordinary about the probes conditions, the agency said. The landers descent towards the moon is expected to start around midnight Japan time on January 20, with its landing on the surface scheduled for 20 minutes later, JAXA said. The H-IIA rocket lifted off in September from the southern island of Tanegashima carrying the lander, after three postponements linked to bad weather. JAXA said this month that the mission would be an unprecedentedly high precision landing on the Moon. The lander is equipped with a spherical probe that was developed with a toy company. Slightly bigger than a tennis ball, it can change its shape to move on the lunar surface. Compared to previous probes that landed a few or 10-plus kilometres away from targets, SLIMs purported margin of error of under 100 metres suggests a level of accuracy once thought impossible, thanks to the culmination of a 20-year effort by researchers, according to JAXA. With the advance of technology, demand is growing to pinpoint targets like craters and rocks on the lunar surface, Shinichiro Sakai, JAXAs SLIM project manager, told reporters this month. Gone are the days when merely exploring somewhere on the moon was desired, he said. Hopes are also high that SLIMs exactitude will make sampling of lunar permafrost easier, bringing scientists a step closer to uncovering the mystery around water resources on the moon, Sakai added. Japanese missions have failed twice  one public and one private. Last year, the country unsuccessfully sent a lunar probe named Omotenashi as part of the United States Artemis 1 mission. In April, Japanese start-up ispace tried in vain to become the first private company to land on the Moon, losing communication with its craft after what it described as a hard landing.

On Monday, SLIM successfully entered the moons orbit at 04.51pm Japan time, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) said in a statement. Its trajectory shift was achieved as originally planned, and there is nothing out of the ordinary about the probes conditions, the agency said. The landers descent towards the moon is expected to start around midnight Japan time on January 20, with its landing on the surface scheduled for 20 minutes later, JAXA said. The H-IIA rocket lifted off in September from the southern island of Tanegashima carrying the lander, after three postponements linked to bad weather. JAXA said this month that the mission would be an unprecedentedly high precision landing on the Moon. The lander is equipped with a spherical probe that was developed with a toy company. Slightly bigger than a tennis ball, it can change its shape to move on the lunar surface. Compared to previous probes that landed a few or 10-plus kilometres away from targets, SLIMs purported margin of error of under 100 metres suggests a level of accuracy once thought impossible, thanks to the culmination of a 20-year effort by researchers, according to JAXA. With the advance of technology, demand is growing to pinpoint targets like craters and rocks on the lunar surface, Shinichiro Sakai, JAXAs SLIM project manager, told reporters this month. Gone are the days when merely exploring somewhere on the moon was desired, he said. Hopes are also high that SLIMs exactitude will make sampling of lunar permafrost easier, bringing scientists a step closer to uncovering the mystery around water resources on the moon, Sakai added. Japanese missions have failed twice  one public and one private. Last year, the country unsuccessfully sent a lunar probe named Omotenashi as part of the United States Artemis 1 mission. In April, Japanese start-up ispace tried in vain to become the first private company to land on the Moon, losing communication with its craft after what it described as a hard landing.

        "content": "Former Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella was not interrogated by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) as a suspect or an accused in the controversial sub-standard Immunoglobulin import issue, but the minister voluntarily provided a further statement to the CID, according to Attorney-at-Law Manoj Gamage. Furthermore, he claimed that the CID did not arrive at the former Health Ministers house to investigate into Rambukwellas connection with the incident in question as reported by certain media, and that instead they had arrived following a request made by the former minister through Presidents Counsel U.R. de Silva on his behalf, in order to provide some evidence documents for further investigations. The initial case pertaining to this issue was also filed under the directives of MP Keheliya Rambukwella, he told reporters after statement was recorded. Meanwhile, Gamage also said that the former Health Minister submitted several written and digital evidence including some video evidence pertaining to the issue of importing substandard Immunoglobulin vials, to the CID today. Issuing a statement in this regard, the Media Secretary of Minister Keheliya Rambukwella also confirmed the matter. Earlier today (Dec. 26), it was reported that a team from the CID had arrived at former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwellas residence for recording a statement over the controversial sub-standard Immunoglobulin import issue. It was also reported that the CID officers had later left the ministers home after recording a statement for over 02 hours. So far, several high profile arrests have been made in connection with the case including the former Secretary of the Ministry of Health, the Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the relevant company which is said to have imported the batch of substandard Immunoglobulin vials by forging documents. They are currently in remand custody.",

Their bodies were found on Monday night in a bloodied apartment in the town of Meaux, 40 km (25 miles) northeast of Paris. Local prosecutor Jean-Baptiste Bladier said the mother and two daughters had been stabbed so many times it was impossible to determine how many blows they had received. The familys two younger sons appeared to have been suffocated or drowned. Police detained the childrens father, 33, at his residence in a nearby town on Monday night. The prosecutor has opened a murder investigation. The children were aged between 9 months and 10 years. Neighbours told investigators they had heard screams during the early hours of Christmas Day. The alarm was raised later in the day after they failed to get any response from the family. The husband had a history of mental illness, the prosecutor said. In 2019, he assaulted his wife with a knife. She did not press charges and the case was dropped due to his mental health at the time. Investigators found medical documents and prescriptions for anti-depressants in the family flat, the prosecutor said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The navy was investigating the nature of the attack on the vessel, MV Chem Pluto, which docked in Mumbai on Monday, and initial reports pointed to a drone attack, a navy statement said. Further forensic and technical analysis will be required to establish the vector of attack, including type and amount of explosive used, the statement added. India was committed to keeping sea lanes in the Indian ocean region safe and secure for maritime trade, the defence minister said on Tuesday.

Lee has gone through three rounds of police questioning on suspicions of using marijuana and other illegal drugs at the home of a hostess working at a high-end bar in Seouls Gangnam district on multiple occasions since early this year, including last Saturday. The actor claimed he was tricked by the hostess into taking the drugs and that he did not know what he was taking. Lee tested negative in both the brief reagent test conducted during police investigations and the lab-based drug test by the National Forensic Service last month. The previous day, Lee submitted a polygraph test request to the Incheon Metropolitan Police Agency charged with the investigation, claiming his innocence.

        "date": "December 27, 2023 11:40 am",
        "content": "Israels war on Hamas will last months, Israels military chief said, as a string of incidents outside the Gaza Strip highlighted the risk of the conflict spreading. Israels Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi told reporters in a televised statement on Tuesday from the Gaza border that the war would go on for many months. There are no magic solutions, there are no shortcuts in dismantling a terrorist organization, only determined and persistent fighting, Halevi said. We will reach Hamas leadership too, whether it takes a week or if it takes months. Israeli actions intensified around Christmas, particularly in a central area just south of the seasonal waterway that bisects the Gaza Strip. The Israeli army told civilians to leave the area, though many said there was no safe place left to go. We are gravely concerned about the continued bombardment of Middle Gaza by Israeli forces, which has claimed more than 100 Palestinian lives since Christmas Eve, said U.N. Human Rights Office spokesperson Seif Magango on Tuesday. Israeli forces must take all measures available to protect civilians. Warnings and evacuation orders do not absolve them of the full range of their international humanitarian law obligations. Israel is determined to destroy Hamas despite global calls for a ceasefire in the 11-week-old war. Since Hamas killed 1,200 people and captured 240 hostages on Oct. 7 in the deadliest day in Israeli history, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has responded with an assault that has laid much of Hamas-ruled Gaza to waste. Palestinian health authorities say nearly 21,000 people have been killed in Israeli strikes, with thousands more feared buried under rubble. Nearly all the enclaves 2.3 million people have been driven from their homes, many several times. Gaza authorities buried 80 unidentified Palestinians on Tuesday whose bodies were handed over by Israel through the Kerem Shalom border crossing, the health ministry said. According to the Islamic Waqf, or religious affairs ministry, the bodies were collected from the northern part of the Gaza Strip. They were buried in a long ditch at a Rafah cemetery in the south. Pictures are being taken to identify them later, a representative of the Gaza Islamic Waqf said during the burials. Israel says it is doing what it can to protect civilians, and blames Hamas for putting them in harms way by operating among them, which Hamas denies. But even Israels closest ally the United States has said it should do more to reduce civilian deaths from what President Joe Biden has called indiscriminate bombing. SPREAD THREAT There are growing signs the conflict is starting to spread. Yemens Iran-backed Houthi militia claimed responsibility for a missile attack on Tuesday on a container ship in the Red Sea and for an attempt to attack Israel with drones. The Houthis have been attacking ships they say have links to Israel in the entrance to the Red Sea, one of the worlds busiest shipping lanes. The attacks are a response to Israels assault on Gaza, the militia says. An Israeli airstrike killed a senior leader of Irans Revolutionary Guards in Syria on Monday. And on the Lebanon border on Tuesday, Israel said Hezbollah fired anti-tank missiles at a church, wounding nine Israeli soldiers and a civilian, after which it fired rockets from near a mosque, drawing retaliatory airstrikes. In India, meanwhile, there was an explosion near the Israeli embassy in New Delhi. Authorities said no staff were hurt. We are in a multi-front war and are coming under attack from seven theatres: Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Judea and Samaria (the West Bank), Iraq, Yemen and Iran, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told lawmakers on Tuesday, listing six places where Iran-backed militants are active, as well as Iran itself. We have already responded and taken action in six of these theatres, he said, without specifying the one that had yet to see Israeli action. Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer was meeting U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan in Washington on Tuesday for talks on the war and the return of hostages, the White House said. The United States has openly pressed Israel in recent weeks to scale down its war to a more targeted operation of raids on Hamas leaders. But Washington is still seen in the region as a supporter of Israel and U.S. forces have been attacked by Iran-backed militants in the Middle East. The U.S. military carried out retaliatory airstrikes on Kataib Hezbollah militants in Iraq on Monday after a drone attack on a U.S. base in Erbil left one U.S. service member in critical condition and wounded two.

After months of controversy over his remarks, Fernando returned to the island on Wednesday morning (29 Nov.). He had arrived from Singapore on board a Qatar Airlines flight and left the airport through the Gold Route at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake. As per a court directive, the CIDs Cyber Crime Investigation Division obtained a statement from the pastor within 48 hours of his arrival on the island. On 17 November, the Court of Appeal ordered the CID not to arrest Pastor Fernando upon his arrival in the country. The ruling also mentioned Pastor Jerome should record a statement with the CIDs Cyber Crime Investigation Division within 48 hours of his arrival. This interim order was issued in respect of the petition filed by Pastor Fernando, seeking to prevent the CID from arresting him.",

        "content": "The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has admitted that it is at fault for the recent island-wide power interruptions, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) said on Wednesday (Dec.27). Citing the state-owned electricity supplier, the PUCSL said the CEB is responsible for failing to restore the power supply for over 5 hours following the sudden major outage reported earlier this month and that it was a problematic situation. The CEB has said it could not maintain an additional power generator to be used in the event of such emergencies, due to inadequate funds. The PUCSL, meanwhile, has stressed that in order for the CEB to find maintenance costs for an additional power generator, the members of the public will have to bear the burden. On December 09, a sudden major power outage was reported across the country at around 5:10 p.m. The cause of island-wide power failures was attributed to the breakdown in the transmission line from Kotmale to Biyagama, which the CEB said was a result of lightning strikes.",

        "content": "The chief custodian of the Ruhunu Kataragama Devalaya has been granted bail on orders of the Tissamaharama Magistrates Court. Somipala. T. Ratnayake was produced before the court after he was arrested in connection with the disappearance of a golden tray offered to the Kataragama Devalaya. Accordingly, the suspect was released on two personal bails of Rs.500,000 each, and on the condition that he appear before the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) on the last Sunday of each month. Somipala. T. Ratnayaka was arrested after he surrendered to the CCD earlier today (27 Dec.). Earlier on 19 December, the custodian responsible for the storage room of the Devalaya had surrendered to the CCD in connection with the same incident. Following submissions to the Tissamaharama Court, the Attorney General directed the CCD to arrest both custodians. When CCD officers visited the homes of the two custodians, family members stated that they had traveled to Colombo for medical treatment. In 2019, the wife of the notorious fugitive gangster Angoda Lokka, found dead in Coimbatore, India in 2020, had offered the 38-pound golden tray to the Kataragama Devalaya. Subsequent investigations revealed that the golden tray had been placed inside the room of the chief custodian, Somipala Ratnayake. Upon learning of the disappearance of the item, a formal complaint was lodged in 2021 by the Basnayake Nilame of Kataragama Devalaya. The investigations were later handed over to the CCD on the directives of Acting IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon. The CCD officers sought advice from the Attorney General in this regard.",

        "date": "December 27, 2023 05:09 pm",
        "content": "The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has vehemently denied the statement made by the chairman of Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) that it had accepted the blame for the major power outage on December 09. Dismissing the statement as incorrect, the state-owned electricity supplier noted that investigations into the matter are still in progress. Statements can be made in this regard following the conclusion of the investigations, CEBs media spokesman Eng. Noel Priyantha said in a press release. Earlier today, the electricity sector regulators chairman Prof. Manjula Fernando, citing the CEB, said the state-owned electricity supplier had admitted that it was at fault for the most recent island-wide power failure. Investigations into the incident are being carried out by two committees, namely the Internal Investigation Committee, chaired by an additional general manager of the CEB, and the External Investigation Committee, appointed by the Power  Energy Ministry. The internal committee is tasked with studying the main reasons for the power outage, looking into the procedures followed by the CEB officials and employees in respect of the incident, and making recommendations to prevent the recurrence of such failures in the future. Meanwhile, the external committee, which comprises experts including university lecturers and professors, is tasked with looking into the origin of the incident, conducting investigations on technical issues, reviewing the time window taken to restore the interrupted electricity supply and presenting recommendations and measures to ensure that such incidents do not recur. On December 09, a sudden major power outage was reported across the country at around 5:10 p.m. and the electricity supply was reported after more than 5 hours. As per initial data, the cause of island-wide power failures was attributed to the breakdown in the transmission line from Kotmale to Biyagama, which the CEB said was a result of lightning strikes.",
