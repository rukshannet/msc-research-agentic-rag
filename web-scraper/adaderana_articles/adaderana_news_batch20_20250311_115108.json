        "title": "Sri Lanka to import coconut?",
        "date": "January 22, 2025 07:54 am",
        "content": "The Ceylon Chamber of Coconut Industries has urged the government for permission to import 200 million coconuts with the next few months. President of the Ceylon Chamber of Coconut Industries Jayantha Samarakoon said that the major reason for the current coconut shortage is the spike in fertilizer prices. Speaking at a media briefing held at the National Chamber of Commerce Auditorium yesterday (21), he mentioned that the coconut imports are essential at this time to counter a severe shortage that threatens both domestic supply and export revenue. Samarakoon attributed the coconut shortfall to skyrocketing fertilizer prices, which have discouraged growers from adequately nourishing coconut crops. He warned that if coconut stocks needed for the coconut-based export industry are not imported immediately, Sri Lanka could lose approximately USD 1 billion in revenue. He further highlighted that the countrys monthly coconut demand stands at 250 million nuts, of which 150 million are consumed domestically while 100 million are utilized by the industrial sector. However, production has failed to keep pace. Sri Lankas annual coconut yield, which previously averaged 3 billion nuts, dropped to 2.68 billion nuts last year. The Coconut Research Institute has forecast a further decline this year, with production estimated to fall to between 2.4 and 2.6 billion nuts. The institute also predicts a shortfall of 200 million coconuts between January and April 2025, exacerbating the crisis. In response, the Chamber has proposed importing alternative coconut products such as coconut milk, coconut kernel, dried coconut kernel, or peeled coconuts to bridge the deficit. Additionally, Samarakoon noted that a steep increase in fertilizer costsfrom Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 12,000 per 50 kg baghas resulted in reducing the growers using fertilizer to less than 10, further worsening the production slump. The Chamber has requested that the government provide fertilizer at a subsidized price of Rs. 4,000 per bag and expressed optimism that the upcoming budget will address this issue. The Chamber also urged the government to introduce subsidies for water supply and soil conservation, which are critical to sustaining coconut cultivation.",

        "title": "Netflix raises prices after reporting its biggest-ever subscriber jump",
        "date": "January 22, 2025 09:35 am",
        "content": "Netflix announced Tuesday it will raise prices on most of its subscription tiers in the US and Canada after the streaming giant reported 19 million new subscribers in the last quarter of 2024. The jump in subscribers, Netflixs biggest-ever, puts the streaming giant at 302 million globally, solidifying the companys hold on the top spot in the industry. Netflix attributed the services latest success to the Mike Tyson and Jake Paul boxing match in November, which it said drew 108 million viewers worldwide, making it the most-streamed sporting event ever. Netflix later hosted two Christmas Day NFL games, which averaged 30 million global viewers, making them the most-streamed football games in history. Subscriptions were also buoyed by the success of Squid Game season two, the platforms biggest premiere to date, which drew 68 million views in its first week. Earlier this month, Netflix also added WWE Raw live broadcasts on Monday nights. The price increases announced Tuesday will see the standard monthly membership without advertisements increase from 15.49 to 17.99, while a standard account with ads will rise one dollar to 7.99. Its highest-priced premium tier, which includes 4K video quality, will increase by 2 to 24.99. As we continue to invest in programming and deliver more value for our members, we will occasionally ask our members to pay a little more so that we can re-invest to further improve Netflix, the company said in a letter to investors. The price hike is the latest for consumers as streaming services increasingly ratchet up monthly costs and push subscribers toward lower-priced ad-supported plans to increase profitability. In recent years, Disney, Max, Peacock, Apple and others have all raised their prices. Netflix last increased the price of its standard plan in 2022. The company on Tuesday reported its revenue increased 16 last quarter, exceeding 10 billion for the first time in its history, while operating income totaled 2.3 billion, a 52 on-year increase. Netflix also announced a 15 billion stock buyback. The news sent shares soaring 13 Tuesday afternoon. On the companys investor call, Ted Sarandos, Netflix co-chief executive, underscored the streamers recent success with live sporting events. Even in an amazing quarter where we had three huge live events  we had an incredible fight, two NFL games  we had one of our biggest TV series ever in Squid Game season two, all very successful events and titles that we are thrilled about, Sarandos said. Sarandos added the company will continue to look to live events and sports for future growth. If there was a path where we could actually make the economics work, for both us and the league, we certainly would explore, Sarandos said. But, right now, we believe that the live events business is where we really want to be, and sports is a very important part of that, but it is a part of that expansion. Tuesdays earnings marks the final time Netflix will publicly report its paid membership figures on a quarterly basis. Instead, the company said it will begin reporting a twice annual engagement report with updates. The surge in paid subscriptions cements Netflixs dominance in the streaming space. In recent years, legacy media companies have poured billions into launching their own streaming services to compete with Netflix as their traditional cable and broadcast businesses wither. While some competitors, including Disney and CNNs parent company Warner Bros. Discovery, have recently reached profitability in the streaming space for the first time, the rivals have struggled to match Netflixs market share. Were fortunate that we dont have distractions like managing declining linear networks and, with our focus and continued investment, we have good and improving productmarket fit around the world, Netflix said in its earnings report.

        "title": "Trump administration directs all federal diversity, equity and inclusion staff be put on leave",
        "date": "January 22, 2025 10:55 am",
        "content": "President Donald Trump s administration moved Tuesday to end affirmative action in federal contracting and directed that all federal diversity, equity and inclusion staff be put on paid leave and eventually be laid off. The moves follow an executive order Trump signed on his first day ordering a sweeping dismantling of the federal governments diversity and inclusion programs that could touch on everything from anti-bias training to funding for minority farmers and homeowners. Trump has called the programs discrimination and insisted on restoring strictly merit-based hiring. The executive order on affirmative action revokes an order issued by President Lyndon Johnson, and curtails DEI programs by federal contractors and grant recipients. Its using one of the key tools utilized by the Biden administration to promote DEI programs across the private sector  pushing their use by federal contractors  to now eradicate them. The Office of Personnel Management in a Tuesday memo directed agencies to place DEI office staffers on paid leave by 5 p.m. Wednesday and take down all public DEI-focused webpages by the same deadline. Several federal departments had removed the webpages even before the memorandum. Agencies must also cancel any DEI-related training and end any related contracts, and federal workers are being asked to report to Trumps Office of Personnel Management if they suspect any DEI-related program has been renamed to obfuscate its purpose within 10 days or face adverse consequences. By Thursday, federal agencies are directed to compile a list of federal DEI offices and workers as of Election Day. By next Friday, they are expected to develop a plan to execute a reduction-in-force action against those federal workers. The memo was first reported by CBS News. The move comes after Mondays executive order accused former President Joe Biden of forcing discrimination programs into virtually all aspects of the federal government through diversity, equity and inclusion programs, known as DEI. That step is the first salvo in an aggressive campaign to upend DEI efforts nationwide, including leveraging the Justice Department and other agencies to investigate private companies pursuing training and hiring practices that conservative critics consider discriminatory against non-minority groups such as white men. The executive order picks up where Trumps first administration left off: One of Trumps final acts during his first term was an executive order banning federal agency contractors and recipients of federal funding from conducting anti-bias training that addressed concepts like systemic racism. Biden promptly rescinded that order on his first day in office and issued a pair of executive orders  now rescinded  outlining a plan to promote DEI throughout the federal government. While many changes may take months or even years to implement, Trumps new anti-DEI agenda is more aggressive than his first and comes amid far more amenable terrain in the corporate world. Prominent companies from Walmart to Facebook have already scaled back or ended some of their diversity practices in response to Trumps election and conservative-backed lawsuits against them. Heres a look at some of the policies and programs that Trump will aim to dismantle: Diversity offices, training and accountability Trumps order will immediately gut Bidens wide-ranging effort to embed diversity and inclusion practices in the federal workforce, the nations largest at about 2.4 million people. Biden had mandated all agencies to develop a diversity plan, issue yearly progress reports, and contribute data for a government-wide dashboard to track demographic trends in hiring and promotions. The administration also set up a Chief Diversity Officers Council to oversee the implementation of the DEI plan. The government released its first DEI progress report in 2022 that included demographic data for the federal workforce, which is about 60 white and 55 male overall, and more than 75 white and more than 60 male at the senior executive level. Trumps executive order will toss out equity plans developed by federal agencies and terminate any roles or offices dedicated to promoting diversity. It will include eliminating initiatives such as DEI-related training or diversity goals in performance reviews. Federal grant and benefits programs Trumps order paves the way for an aggressive but bureaucratically complicated overhaul of billions of dollars in federal spending that conservative activists claim unfairly carve out preference for racial minorities and women. The order does not specify which programs it will target but mandates a government-wide review to ensure that contracts and grants are compliant with the Trump administrations anti-DEI stance. It also proposes that the federal government settle ongoing lawsuits against federal programs that benefit historically underserved communities, including some that date back decades. Trumps executive order is a seismic shift and a complete change in the focus and direction of the federal government, said Dan Lennington, deputy council for the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law  Liberty, which has pursued several lawsuits against federal programs. The institute recently released an influential report listing dozens of programs the Trump administration should consider dismantling, such as credits for minority farmers or emergency relief assistance for majority-Black neighborhoods. He acknowledged that unwinding some entrenched programs may be difficult. For example, the Treasury Department implements housing and other assistance programs through block grants to states that have their own methods for implementing diversity criteria. Pay equity and hiring practices Its not clear whether the Trump administration will target every initiative that stemmed from Bidens DEI executive order. For example, the Biden administration banned federal agencies from asking about an applicants salary history when setting compensation, a practice many civil rights activists say perpetuates pay disparities for women and people of color. It took three years for the Biden administration to issue the final regulations, and Trump would have to embark on a similar rule-making process, including a notice and comment period, to rescind it, said Chiraag Bains, former deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under Biden and now a nonresident senior fellow with Brookings Metro. Noreen Farrell, executive director of gender rights group Equal Rights Advocates, said that she was hopeful that the Trump administration will not go out of its way to undo the rule, which she said has proved popular in some state and cities that have enacted similar policies. And Bidens DEI plan encompassed some initiatives with bipartisan support, said Bains. For example, he tasked the Chief Diversity Officers Executive Council with expanding federal employment opportunities for those with criminal records. That initiative stems from the Fair Chance Act, which Trump signed into law in 2019 and bans federal agencies and contractors from asking about an applicants criminal history before a conditional job offer is made. Bains said thats what Bidens DEI policies were about: ensuring that the federal government was structured to include historically marginalized communities, not institute reverse discrimination against white men. Despite the sweeping language of Trumps order, Farrell said, the reality of implementing such massive structural changes is far more complex. Federal agencies have deeply embedded policies and procedures that cant simply be switched off overnight, she added. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

The MP raised this issue in Parliament today (21) while participating in the debate on the Clean Sri Lanka national initiative. On January 9, 2025, I questioned the Minister of Power and Energy regarding the possibility of reducing electricity tariffs. As a follow-up, I pointed out that the Ceylon Electricity Board had recorded a profit of Rs. 167 billion in 2024. However, the Minister refuted this, asserting that the board was burdened with a debt of Rs. 322 billion, and insisted that the alleged profit must be proven. MP Jayasekara further explained that the Chairman of the Committee on Public Finance Dr. Harsha de Silva later contradicted the Ministers statement. At that moment, Dr. Harsha de Silva stood up and referenced page 36 of the 2024 Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report, which confirmed that the Electricity Board had made a profit of Rs. 119.209 billion as of June 30, 2024. By denying this officially recorded profit and presenting false information to the Parliament, the Minister not only misled the Parliament but also obstructed my duties as an MP, amounting to a breach of privilege, Jayasekara argued.

        "date": "January 22, 2025 02:57 pm",
        "content": "Israels military chief has resigned, saying he recognised his responsibility for its failure on 7 October 2023, when the Palestinian armed group Hamas carried out a deadly attack on the country that triggered the Gaza war. In a letter to the defence minister, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi admitted the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had failed in its mission to protect the citizens of Israel. My responsibility for the terrible failure accompanies me every day, every hour, and will be so for the rest of my life, he added. The general said he would leave his role on 6 March at a time of significant achievements for the IDF, although he acknowledged that not all of Israels war goals had been achieved. The military will continue to fight to further dismantle Hamas and its governing capabilities, ensure the return of the hostages and enable Israelis displaced by attacks by armed groups to return home, he added. Shortly afterwards, the chief of the IDFs Southern Command, Maj Gen Yaron Finkelman, also announced he was also stepping down, saying he had had failed in his duty to protect the Western Negev and its beloved, heroic residents. Their resignations come three days after the start of a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal agreed with Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and others. Israeli military and intelligence officials missed or ignored many warnings before hundreds of Hamas gunmen breached Israels Gaza perimeter fence at multiple locations 15 months ago and attacked nearby Israeli communities, IDF bases and a music festival. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. The IDF responded by launching an air and ground campaign in Gaza, during which more than 47,100 Palestinians have been killed, according to the territorys Hamas-run health ministry. Gen Halevi said in a televised address on Tuesday that Hamass military wing had been severely damaged, with most of the groups leadership and military commanders have been killed along with almost 20,000 operatives. He also promised that the IDFs inquiry into the events of 7 October, which he plans to complete before leaving his role, would be high quality, thorough, and fully transparent. However, he warned that the military inquiry is focused solely on the IDF and does not encompass the broader factors that could prevent similar events in the future. A commission of inquiry or any other external body can investigate and examine and will receive full transparency from the IDF, he said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked Gen Halevi for his many years of service and for commanding the IDF during the war, saying it had led to major achievements for Israel. Up to now, Netanyahu has said only that he is deeply sorry about what happened on 7 October and that he will have to answer some tough questions over his role, without acknowledging any responsibility. He has also said an independent commission of inquiry should wait until the end of the Gaza war. Opposition leader Yair Lapid praised Halevis decision and called on Netanyahu to follow suit. Now, it is time for them to take responsibility and resign - the prime minister and his entire catastrophic government, he said. Gen Halevi is currently overseeing the IDFs compliance with a three-phase Gaza ceasefire deal with Hamas that should see the remaining Israeli hostages released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. In total, 33 hostages should be released during the first phase lasting six weeks. Hamas handed over three women on Sunday, when the ceasefire took effect, and has said it will free another four women on Saturday. Israeli forces should also withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza, displaced Palestinians should be allowed to begin returning to their homes, and hundreds of aid lorries should be allowed into the territory each day. Negotiations for the second phase - which should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli troop withdrawal and the restoration of sustainable calm - should start in just over two weeks. The third and final stage should involve the reconstruction of Gaza, which could take years, and the return of any remaining hostages bodies. However, there is high anxiety among Palestinians in Gaza and the hostages families about whether the deal will hold. New US President Donald Trump, who has taken credit for brokering the ceasefire, said on Monday that he was not confident that all three phases would be implemented. Netanyahu has said Israel already has US backing to return to the fighting if it reaches the conclusion that the second phase negotiations are ineffectual. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "The World Bank has reaffirmed its support for poverty reduction, digital development, and the Clean Sri Lanka initiative, with plans to finance three major projects over the next three months, totaling USD 200 million. World Bank Vice President for South Asia, Martin Raiser, concluded a 2-day visit to Sri Lanka today, where he met with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya and other government officials, private investors, and development partners to discuss the countrys ongoing efforts towards economic recovery and long-term growth. Raiser was grateful for the opportunity to meet the new government and understand their development priorities for Sri Lanka. He was also encouraged by discussions with private sector stakeholders about potential opportunities to foster growth and job creation, says the World Bank. Key areas of focus during the visit included the governments commitment to poverty reduction, digital development, and the Clean Sri Lanka initiative. The World Bank reaffirmed its support in these areas, with plans to finance three key projects over the next three months totaling 200 million. These projects will support rural development and education and will establish a facility to attract private investment in renewable energy. The World Bank is committed to supporting Sri Lankas development agenda, particularly in the areas of poverty reduction, digital transformation, and sustainability, said Martin Raiser. We look forward to financing projects that will have a direct impact on improving the livelihoods of the Sri Lankan people. Raiser and the Sri Lankan authorities also discussed priorities for World Bank support over the medium-term, including enhancing the tourism sector; supporting the development of lagging regionsespecially in the North; promoting the logistics sector as a driver of growth; improving service delivery, and ensuring the workforce is equipped with the skills required by a rapidly evolving labor market, the statement said. Raiser emphasized the importance of maintaining macroeconomic stability, improving governance and attracting private sector investment as critical factors for boosting incomes and creating jobs. Sri Lankas growth prospects depend on the mobilization of additional private sector investment, including foreign direct investment. Ample opportunities exist in the digital economy, tourism, logistics, agricultural value chains, and renewable energy, but realizing this potential will require further improvements in the business climate, Raiser added. The World Banks program in Sri Lanka for the coming years will be summarized in the upcoming mid-term review of the World Bank Groups Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Sri Lanka. The updated CPF, scheduled to be finalized within the next six months, will build on the governments key priorities and serve as a roadmap for continued collaboration between Sri Lanka and the World Bank Group, it added. Raiser concluded his visit by reiterating the World Banks readiness to offer comprehensive support for Sri Lanka as the country transitions from recovery to sustained, inclusive economic growth by bringing together the public and private sector arms of the World Bank Group.",

        "date": "January 22, 2025 05:10 pm",
        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake emphasized that a country cannot progress solely through laws and regulations and highlighted that tradition is a vital component of a nation. President Disanayake emphasized that Sri Lanka has accomplished a remarkable mission through the traditions built on Buddhism and that it is the responsibility of everyone to safeguard these Buddhist traditions and pass them down securely to future generations. The President expressed these views during a discussion held today (22) at the Presidential Secretariat on the 74th Upasampada Vinaya Karma ceremony of the Sri Lanka Rāmañña Maha Nikāya, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) stated. The President, recalling the historical significance of the Upasampada Vinaya Karma, a major ceremony in Buddhism, stated that the cessation of ordained monks (Upasampada Bhikkhus) would mean the dissolution of the Buddhist institution itself. He emphasized the importance of preserving these ancient traditions and carrying them forward with honour. The national Upasampada Vinaya Karma ceremony, organized biennially by the Sri Lanka Rāmañña Maha Nikāya, is scheduled to take place from June 30 to July 5, 2025, at the Punyawardhanarama Viharaya in Vijithapura, Palugaswewa, within the Udakukkhepa Sima Malakaya, the PMD said. This grand ceremony, which will ordain over 250 novice monks (Samanera), will be conducted under state sponsorship. As the government considers the national Upasampada Vinaya Karma ceremony, which is held every two years, a dignified task, the President instructed officials to ensure that all necessary facilities are provided without any shortcomings, the statement added. The discussion was attended by prominent figures, including the Most Venerable Makulewe Wimala Mahanayake Thero, the highest prelate of the Sri Lanka Rāmañña Maha Nikāya of the Sangha ancestry of Mahavihara; Most Venerable Professor Aththangane Rathanapala Nayaka Thero, Supreme Judicial Leader of Sri Lanka Rāmañña Maha Nikāya; the Anu Nayaka Theros, Most Venerable Waleboda Gunasiri Thero and Most Venerable Ankumbure Premavansa Thero; along with the Maha Sangha, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment, and Tourism Vijitha Herath; Minister of Buddha Sasana, Religious, and Cultural Affairs Dr. Hiniduma Sunil Senevi; Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake; Senior Additional Secretary to the President Roshan Gamage; former High Court Justice and Governor of the North Central Province Wasantha Kumara Wimalasiri; Chairman of the Rāmañña Nikayarakshaka Sabha and former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya; Secretary of the Rāmañña Nikayarakshaka Sabha and former Member of Parliament Lasantha Alagiyawanna, among others. --PMD--",

        "date": "January 22, 2025 05:40 pm",
        "content": "Prince Harry settled his privacy claim against Rupert Murdochs UK newspaper group on Wednesday after the publisher admitted unlawful actions at its Sun tabloid for the first time, bringing the fiercely-contested legal battle to a dramatic end. In a stunning victory for Harry, 40, the younger son of King Charles, News Group Newspapers (NGN), publisher of The Sun and the now-defunct News of the World, also admitted it had intruded into the private life of his late mother, Princess Diana. Harrys lawyer, David Sherborne, said the publisher had agreed to pay the prince substantial damages. A source familiar with the settlement said it involved an eight-figure sum. Harry had been suing NGN at the High Court in London, accusing its newspapers of unlawfully obtaining private information about him from 1996 until 2011. The trial to consider the royals case, and a similar lawsuit from former senior British lawmaker Tom Watson, was due to start on Tuesday but following last-gasp talks, the two sides reached a settlement, with NGN saying there had been wrongdoing at The Sun, something it had denied for years. NGN offers a full and unequivocal apology to the Duke of Sussex for the serious intrusion by The Sun between 1996 and 2011 into his private life, including incidents of unlawful activities carried out by private investigators working for The Sun, Sherborne said. NGN further apologises to the Duke for the impact on him of the extensive coverage and serious intrusion into his private life as well as the private life of Diana, Princess of Wales, his late mother, in particular during his younger years. ACCOUNTABILITY NGN has paid out hundreds of millions of pounds to victims of phone-hacking and other unlawful information gathering by the News of the World, and settled more than 1,300 lawsuits involving celebrities, politicians, well-known sports figures and ordinary people who were connected to them or major events. But it had always rejected any claims that there was wrongdoing at The Sun newspaper, or that any senior figures knew about it or tried to cover it up, as Harrys lawsuit alleges. Harry said his mission was to get the truth and accountability, after other claimants settled cases to avoid the risk of a multi-million pound legal bill that could be imposed even if they won in court but rejected NGNs offer. He said the reason he had not settled was because his lawsuit was not about money, but because he wanted the publishers executives and editors to be held to account and to admit their wrongdoing.

        "date": "January 22, 2025 07:06 pm",
        "content": "Shares of Netflix soared 15 to hit an all-time high on Wednesday after the streaming giants big bet on sports helped add a record 18.9 million subscribers in the holiday quarter, reassuring investors it still has more room to grow. The company also unveiled price hikes on Tuesday in markets including the U.S., aiming to boost revenue just as it shifts focus from subscriber growth to other performance metrics such as sales. We thought it was a typo. Netflix defied the odds once again, delivering subscriber additions far beyond even the most unreasonable subscriber bogey, Bernstein analyst Laurent Yoon said. Netflix, already worth more than the combined valuations of rivals Disney, Comcast, Paramount and Warner Bros Discovery, was set to add nearly 56 billion to its market capitalization of about 370 billion, based on premarket share movements. Its shares soared more than 80 last year, driven by Netflixs expansion into live sports with content including a boxing match between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson, as well as the debut of popular National Football League games on Christmas Day - which included a half-time performance from popstar Beyonce. The Nov. 15 Tyson-Paul bout was the most-streamed sporting event ever and drove the most sign-ups for Netflix for any event since Antenna started tracking this data in 2019. Its strong content slate in the quarter also included the second season of Squid Game and the hit streaming movie Carry-On. Netflixs global subscriber base now exceeds 300 million, giving it a commanding lead in the streaming wars and more leverage in talks with marketing firms as it looks to grow its ad-supported business. Sports rights can be incredibly expensive and it makes sense that Netflix has opted to go with special events. Such events are also perfect for attracting advertisers keen to reach a large audience, said Dan Coatsworth, analyst at AJ Bell. Coatsworth, as well as several other analysts, said Netflix would now inevitably start bidding for other major sports rights. The company has already secured U.S. broadcast rights for the 2027 and 2031 editions of FIFA Womens World Cups. NARROW REVENUE BEAT The strong report, however, masked one concern: the subscriber surge did not translate into a similar spike in revenue. Sales rose 16 and were only around 100 million above estimates, while the subscriber growth was about twice the expected number. The narrow beat could be attributed to both subscriber growth from lower average revenue per user (ARPU) countries and the significant number of sign-ups for the ad-supported tier, said Ben Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot. But he added that the already announced price hikes and those expected to roll out over the course of 2025 should boost sales. This year, Netflix is expected to showcase new seasons of highly popular shows such as Stranger Things and Wednesday. It has already started streaming WWE RAW. At least 20 analysts raised their price targets on the stock, bringing the median target to 970, according to LSEG data. The stocks 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio stands at 35.43 compared with Walt Disneys 19.19. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The primary objective of the Food Policy and Security Committee is to take necessary actions to implement the governments policy of ensuring a safe, secure and sustainable food system for all citizens, the Presidents Media Division (PMD). During the meeting, it was emphasized that accurate data and information are essential for making informed policy decisions related to food security. The government highlighted that it is unwilling to take risks by making decisions without reliable data. Consequently, establishing a robust data and information system has been identified as a top priority, the statement said. The Minister of Agriculture further highlighted the need to provide rice not only for direct consumption but also as an essential resource for industries such as poultry, egg production and beer manufacturing, all of which contribute to human consumption. He stressed the importance of considering these needs in the implementation of the governments progressive agricultural policies. Additionally, the Minister emphasized the necessity of studying the countrys food consumption patterns to foster a healthier population and minimize food waste. He advised committee members to take appropriate steps in this regard. Several key areas were discussed, including the establishment of a national food security policy framework, the maintenance of an essential food information system, the formulation of new strategies aligned with internationally recognized standards and the development of plans to increase and distribute local production based on scientific evidence. The discussions also addressed food security, food pricing and market management, according to the PMD. The meeting was attended by committee members, including Secretary to the Prime Minister G.P.

        "date": "January 23, 2025 06:15 am",
        "content": "A new wildfire that broke out north of Los Angeles on Wednesday rapidly spread to more than 8,000 acres (32 square km), fueled by strong winds and dry brush, forcing mandatory evacuation orders for more than 19,000 people. The Hughes fire about 50 miles (80 km) north of Los Angeles further taxed firefighters in the region who have managed to bring two major fires burning in the metropolitan area largely under control. In just a few hours on Wednesday the new fire grew to more than half the size of the Eaton Fire, one of the two monster conflagrations that have ravaged the Los Angeles area. Officials warned people in the Castaic Lake area of Los Angeles County that they faced immediate threat to life, while much of Southern California remained under a red-flag warning for extreme fire risk due to strong, dry winds. Some 19,000 people, a number roughly equal to the entire population of the community of Castaic, were under mandatory evacuation orders, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said. Another 16,000 were under evacuation warnings. Los Angeles County, the state of California and the U.S. Forest Service said their firefighters were responding. The Angeles National Forest said its entire 700,000-acre (2,800-sq-km) park in the San Gabriel Mountains was closed to visitors. As a result of the red-flag warning, some 1,100 firefighters were deployed around Southern California in anticipation of fast-moving fires, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said. Southern California has gone without significant rain for nine months, contributing to hazardous conditions, but some rain was forecast from Saturday through Monday, possibly giving firefighters much-needed relief. Helicopters scooped water out of a lake to drop on the fire while fixed-wing aircraft dropped fire retardant on the hills, video on KTLA television showed. Flames spread to the waters edge. Interstate 5, the major north-south highway in the western United States, was closed in the mountain pass areas known as the Grapevine due to poor visibility from the smoke, the California Highway Patrol said. While the new fire raged, the two deadly fires that have ravaged Los Angeles came under greater control, Cal Fire said. The Eaton Fire that scorched 14,021 acres (57 square km) east of Los Angeles was 91 contained, while the larger Palisades Fire, which has consumed 23,448 acres (95 square km) on the west side of Los Angeles, stood at 68 contained. Containment measures the percentage of a fires perimeter that firefighters have under control. Since the two fires broke out on Jan. 7, they have burned an area nearly the size of Washington, D.C., killed 28 people and damaged or destroyed nearly 16,000 structures, Cal Fire said. At one point, 180,000 people were under evacuation orders, according to Los Angeles County officials. Private forecaster AccuWeather projects damage and economic losses at more than 250 billion. A series of smaller wildfires has been extinguished or brought largely under control in Southern California the past two weeks. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

On his X account, Annamalali tagged a video clip of Tamil Nadu Congress Committee President K Selvaperunthagai purportedly saying the ceding was a strategic maneuver by India Gandhi. He constantly repeats this to emphasise how Indians should be thankful to Smt Indira Gandhi. The DMK  Congress have, for the last 4 decades, led to the loss of lives of our fishermen and put the lives of Tamil Fishermen at risk through their unilateral decision-making by gifting away Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka without even tabling this decision in the Parliament for discussion in 1974, Annamalai said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been working tirelessly to safeguard the nations sovereignty and has bridged the gap in infrastructure in Jammu  Kashmir and the Northeastern region, which remained neglected during the Congress regime. And here we have Congress boasting with pride that gifting away a critical island that belonged to India was Smt Indira Gandhis strategic maneuver. Does Thiru SPK_TNCC realise that Congress  DMKs strategic maneuver has cost the lives of our fishermen, many losing their livelihood due to constant arrest  loss of shipping vessels, he asked.

        "date": "January 23, 2025 07:49 am",
        "content": "It was a simple, sunny afternoon on Canadas Prince Edward Island as Joe Velaidum and his partner, Laura Kelly, set off to walk their dog. Noticing a stray leash lying in the yard, Velaidum briefly stopped to pick it up before setting off on a quick walk. Minutes later, a meteorite pummeled the walkway  exactly where Velaidum had been standing  and a Ring doorbell camera captured the entire incident on video. I never stop on that spot  ever, Velaidum told CNN about the incident, which occurred in July 2024. And looking back on it now, we noticed, because of the video, if I had stayed on that very spot for just two minutes longer, I absolutely would have been struck and probably killed by this meteor. Months later, after undergoing lab analysis that confirmed it was, in fact, a rock that had plummeted from space, the object has been officially cataloged in a database kept by the nonprofit Meteoritical Society. The specimen  named Charlottetown after the nearby city  stands out because of its accompanying video, which the University of Alberta released last week. While the doorbell footage showing its arrival is not the first caught on video, its remarkable because the incident was captured at very close range and with recorded sound, according to Dr. Chris Herd, a professor of Earth and atmospheric sciences at the University of Alberta in Canada. The Charlottetown Meteorite sure announced its arrival in a spectacular way, Herd, who collected the specimen and curates the University of Albertas meteorite collection, told CNN. No other meteorite fall has been documented like this, complete with sound, he said. A rare find Even in Herds line of work, incidents like the meteorite strike in Prince Edward Island  Canadas smallest province that lies just north of Nova Scotia  almost never come up. The University of Albertas online meteorite reporting system receives about 10 submissions a week. But .1 or less of inquiries that come in actually turn out to be meteorites, Herd said. Velaidum, a university professor himself, did not readily accept the possibility that the object that struck his front yard was extraterrestrial in origin. More likely, he guessed, it fell from an aircraft or off the roof. The rational part of my brain just said, No, this has got to be something much more mundane than a meteorite, right? Velaidum said. Initially, he said, the couple began to sweep the detritus off the sidewalk. It was Kellys father, who lives nearby, who prompted the couple to dredge up some samples for further inspection. Using a vacuum and magnet  which can attract the metals found in meteorites  they scraped together a 95-gram (3-ounce) sample. When a quick online search turned up the University of Albertas meteorite collection, the couple reached out, sending along some photos. Herd said he knew instantly that they had a bona fide space rock. I have the expertise that Ive looked at hundreds, if not thousands of these types of photos, Herd said, noting that meteorites are coated with a black shell that forms when space rocks react with Earths thick atmosphere while traveling more than 45,000 miles (72,420 kilometers) per hour. What makes the occurrence more special, Herd said, is the fact that a camera captured the moment of impact  a stunning observation not just because it confirms the meteorites arrival, but also because the footage can benefit science. We are working on analyzing the video to see if we can say more about the meteorites fall  including speed, Herd said. We might be able to analyze the sound, for example, to say something about the physical properties of the rock. A special specimen Herd and Velaidum also pointed out a string of bizarre coincidences associated with the meteorites arrival. First and perhaps most sobering, Velaidum would have been struck by the object if it had arrived just a few minutes earlier. It was the first confirmed meteorite strike in the history of the 2,200 square-mile (5,700 square-kilometer) Prince Edward Island. And Herd happened to have a family vacation planned on the island about 10 days after the incident, so he was able to retrieve the specimen in person. Its crazy. This story is full of all kinds of things like that  serendipity, Herd said. Velaidum added that he teaches a religious studies course on the meaning of life at the University of Prince Edward Island, which includes a discussion of the vastness and power of the wider universe. We have a section of the course that deals with the immensity of space and how insignificant our existence seems when considered against that backdrop, Velaidum said, which is another strange coincidence . The type of space rock that hit his property, however, is not all that rare. Its classified as an ordinary chondrite  dubbed ordinary because they are common as far as meteorites go. But its origin is no less fascinating: Were quite certain in the scientific community that these types of meteorites come from broken pieces off of asteroids in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, Herd said. This one chunk that arrived to Earth last July 25 at 5:02 p.m.  was probably in space for millions or tens of millions of years prior to that, he added. Why meteorites matter Today, the Charlottetown meteorite is part of the University of Albertas Meteorite Collection, which houses more than 1,800 specimens  the largest of its kind in Canada. Herd, the curator of the collection, said members of the public who hope to submit a suspected meteorite for consideration should keep in mind that some earthly objects are often mistaken for space rocks. Slag, for example, is the rocky black substance that is discarded as a by-product from smelting or refining metal. But slag often has visible bubbles  and bubbles are extremely rare in in meteorites. Whats valuable and fascinating about sorting the meteorwrongs, as the scientific community jokingly refers to them, from the meteorites is the information about our universe that these space rocks can offer. Everything on the Earth is newer because of geology and active processes (on our home planets surface), Herd said. Theres no rocks of that age  4 and a half billion years old  that are preserved on the Earth. This is amazing!!A doorbell camera capturing a meteorite impact. https:t.coicWj2aeV3a pic.twitter.comr8YN0igg0d tern (1goodtern) January 16, 2025 Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "date": "January 23, 2025 09:11 am",
        "content": "Respiratory specialist Dr. Samanmalee Dalpadathu has revealed that 10 of Sri Lankans over the age of 40 suffer from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a condition often caused by smoking, prolonged exposure to air pollution, or untreated asthma. Speaking at a media briefing organized by the Health Promotion Bureau, Dr. Dalpadathu highlighted the lack of awareness about COPD among the general public, despite its significant impact. COPD is the 7th leading cause of death globally. Many people develop it unknowingly due to factors such as untreated asthma or smoking. Initially, the symptoms are hidden, but as the disease progresses, patients experience breathing difficulties, especially during physical activities like climbing stairs or hills, she explained. Dr. Dalpadathu referred to a 2017 survey that found one in ten Sri Lankans over 40 have COPD. She emphasized that this lack of early detection stems from a poor understanding of the disease and its risk factors. Preventing and Managing COPD Dr. Dalpadathu also stressed the importance of prevention and long-term management of COPD. Preventing unnecessary exposure to air pollution and consistently wearing masks in high-risk environments can significantly reduce the risk of developing COPD. Parents with undiagnosed COPD often struggle to breathe and are severely affected by even minor respiratory infections, she stated. She clarified that while COPD differs from asthma, the only effective treatment is the long-term use of inhalers. There is no cure for COPD. It is a chronic condition requiring sustained management with inhalers, she added. Dr. Dalpadathu urged greater public awareness and early intervention to mitigate the diseases impact, which often remains unnoticed until its advanced stages.",

        "date": "January 23, 2025 09:44 am",
        "content": "Hundreds of same-sex couples are set to tie the knot on Thursday as Thailand officially becomes the first Southeast Asian nation to recognise marriage equality. The landmark legislation, passed last year and now coming into effect, represents a monumental victory for the LGBTQ community after over a decade of relentless advocacy. This could be a model for the world, said Kittinun Daramadhaj, president of the Rainbow Sky Association of Thailand. There is true marriage equality in Thailand. Under the groundbreaking law, same-sex couples gain full legal, financial, and medical rights, including adoption and inheritance protections. For many, this legislation signals a new chapter of inclusion and progress in a country long celebrated for its vibrant LGBTQ culture. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra praised the achievement during an event last week, where she welcomed LGBTQ couples and activists to the governments offices. This demonstrates that Thailand is ready to embrace diversity and accept love in all its forms, she said. 200 couples to tie knot Festivities to mark this historic occasion are set to unfold across the country. In Bangkok, at least 200 couples will tie the knot in a mass wedding at a bustling shopping mall, co-organised by Bangkok Pride and local authorities. A colourful pride carpet will be rolled out for the newlyweds, accompanied by performances from celebrities and drag queens. Celebrations will also ripple through other regions, from the coastal city of Pattaya to the mountainous city of Chiang Mai, with rainbow flags waving as symbols of love and resilience. This is not just a victory for the LGBTQ community but for all of Thailand, said one participant in Bangkok. It shows that love truly knows no boundaries. Pioneering equality in Asia Thailands achievement places it alongside Taiwan and Nepal as the only Asian jurisdictions recognising same-sex marriage. However, rights experts caution that Thailand may remain an outlier in the region, where progress on LGBTQ rights has been slow. Globally, more than 30 jurisdictions recognise same-sex marriage, primarily in Europe, the Americas, and Australasia, according to the Pew Research Center. Looking ahead: Advocacy for trans rights While Thursdays celebrations mark a significant milestone, advocates emphasise that the fight for equality is far from over. Activists are now pushing for the Thai government to allow transgender individuals to legally change their gender identity, a long-overdue recognition for the countrys estimated 314,000 trans people. Theres a misconception that trans people are fully embraced in Thailand, but theres still a lot of work to be done, said Hua Boonyapisomparn of the Foundation of Transgender Alliance for Human Rights.

Dr. Amarasuriya made this remark while speaking during todays (23) parliamentary session. Responding to a question raised regarding the matter in the Parliament, the Prime Minister stated that the situation which led to the delay of the releasing of results was a misfortune, adding that the answer sheets evaluation activities of the examination is currently underway. However, she assured that the releasing of results and the process of admission of students to Grade 06 will be expedited. An investigation was launched on September 20, 2024 by the Department of Examinations after allegations surfaced regarding the leakage of three questions from the 2024 Grade 5 Scholarship Examination. While the initial probe revealed only three questions were leaked, controversy escalated as some parents, staging protests and holding press conferences, claimed that the entire question paper had been compromised. Following this, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) took over the investigation, uncovering that the Director of the Planning Division of the National Institute of Education (NIE) and a school teacher were involved in the incident. Both were arrested and remanded until October 22. In response to the public outcry, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake intervened, leading to the suspension of the evaluation of answer sheets until the investigation was concluded. On October 14, Commissioner General of Examinations Amith Jayasundara announced that the examination would not be re-conducted, and free marks would be awarded for the three leaked questions. However, in November, the Supreme Court issued an interim order halting the release of the 2024 Grade 5 Scholarship Examination results until further proceedings. On December 31, 2024, the Supreme Court declared that the fundamental human rights have been violated through the Cabinet of Ministers decision to award free marks to all students for the three questions of the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination which are alleged to have been leaked. Accordingly, the court also ordered the Commissioner General of Examinations to immediately implement a suitable recommendation out of the three recommendations made by the experts committee appointed to look into the matter. Later on, the Commissioner General of Examinations, Amith Jayasundara announced that it was decided to award free marks to all students for the three questions which were alleged to have been leaked in the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination, as per the Supreme Court verdict pertaining to the case.",

At least six other people were injured, the news agency cited police officer Dattatraya Karale as saying. The accident occurred in Jalgaon, one of the largest cities in Maharashtra, near the Pardhade railroad station, 410 kilometers (255 miles) northeast of Mumbai, Indias financial capital. PTI said the victims jumped off the Pushpak Express train, which had stopped after some passengers pulled an emergency chain. Those who disembarked were hit by another express train on the adjacent railroad track, PTI quoted railway spokesman Swapnil Nila as saying. Our preliminary information is that there were sparks inside one of the coaches of the Pushpak Express due to either a hot axle or brake-binding (jamming), and some passengers panicked. They pulled the chain, and some of them jumped down on the tracks. At the same time, Karnataka Express was passing on the adjoining track, a senior railway official told PTI. Despite government efforts to improve rail safety, hundred of accidents occur every year on Indias railways, which is the largest train network under one management in the world. In 2023, two passenger trains collided after derailing in eastern India, killing more than 280 people and injuring hundreds in one of the countrys deadliest rail crashes in decades. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is focusing on the modernization of the British colonial-era railroad network in India, which has become the worlds most populous country with 1.42 billion people.

Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya addressed the inquiry, asserting that no vehicles have been distributed to the members of the 10th Parliament. However, the Prime Minister noted that the Presidential Secretariat had issued one vehicle, KR-5844, to MP Sugath Wasantha de Silva considering it a specific requirement. She clarified that the vehicle was provided without a driver and that no fuel had been supplied for its use. Countering this explanation, MP Chamara Sampath highlighted alleged discrepancies. There are vehicles at the Madiwela Housing Complex being used irresponsibly, he claimed, adding that A Range Rover, more expensive than a V8, is being driven by a minister in this Parliament. Should I name him? Wasantha Samarasinghe. He further alleged that another Range Rover, which recently gained attention on social media, is registered under the name of the Secretary of the Ministry of Tourism and is being used by another MP. While refraining from naming the individual, MP Chamara Sampath claimed that the vehicle is actively in use at the Poonagala Estate in Bandarawela.",

Urgent Passport Applications The Minister explained that a committee within the Department of Immigration and Emigration handles urgent passport requests. Citizens with immediate needs can apply through this committee, which assesses and approves such requests, enabling applicants to receive their passports on the same day. In addition to the standard service, we have developed a system to ensure that urgent passport needs are met.

        "date": "January 23, 2025 04:45 pm",
        "content": "Japanese TV host Masahiro Nakai, one of the countrys most recognisable faces on television, has announced that he is retiring after a sexual assault allegation that has rocked the countrys entertainment industry. Nakai, who presented for Fuji Television, was accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a 2023 dinner party held by staff. Dozens of companies have pulled their commercials from Fuji Television amid claims that the companys staff had tried to cover up the scandal. Nakai has denied using violence against the woman, and said on 9 January that he had resolved the matter with her through a settlement. But this did little to quell public anger. In a social media statement posted on Thursday, Nakai said that he was truly sorry for causing trouble and losses to so many people. Im really, really sorry for saying good-bye this way. His resignation comes days after Fuji Television president Koichi Minato confirmed that the company did not disclose Nakais scandal despite being aware of it long before it was reported in the media. Vehicle makers Nissan and Toyota, as well as retail company Seven  I holdings which runs the retail 7-eleven convenience store chain, were among those that announced they were pulling advertising from Fuji Television over the scandal. Fuji Television is expected to set up an independent committee to investigate the scandal. Appearances of Nakai have also been scrubbed from programmes. Nakai soared to stardom in the 1990s as the leader of Japanese boy band SMAP, one of Asias most successful acts. The group released more than 50 singles - many of which became chart toppers - and launched a weekly variety show on prime-time television. After SMAP disbanded in 2016, Nakai went on to become a television host as well as one of the wealthiest celebrities in Japan. Japans entertainment industry is facing a reckoning with long unspoken cases of sexual assault. In 2023, J-pop executive Johnny Kitagawa, who by then had been dead for four years, was exposed to have sexually abused hundreds of boys and young men for decades. His talent agency, Johnny  Associates, had managed SMAP among other boy bands. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "January 23, 2025 04:55 pm",
        "content": "Meta, the company which owns social media networks Facebook and Instagram, has denied forcing users to follow official accounts belonging to senior figures in the new Trump administration. Some users of the platforms had complained following Donald Trumps inauguration on Monday that they had automatically been made to follow the new president, as well as Vice-President JD Vance and First Lady Melania Trump. Meta spokesman Andy Stone explained that the accounts were managed by the White House, which had updated them to reflect the new position holders. This is the same procedure we followed during the last presidential transition, he wrote in a statement. The accounts carry the handles Potus - which stands for president of the United States - as well as VicePresident and Flotus, an acronym for the first lady. Archived versions of the pages show the Potus and Flotus accounts previously carried the name and official portrait of Joe Biden and Jill Biden, respectively. Mr Stone added that it may take some time for follow and unfollow requests to go through as these accounts change hands. Trump became US president for the second time on Monday and quickly set about issuing a range of executive orders and directives asserting his political agenda - ranging from withdrawing from the World Health Organisation to declaring a national emergency at the border with Mexico. His inauguration was attended by some of the most influential tech billionaires, including Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg and X chief Elon Musk, who also has an advisory role in the new administration. Trump has previously been heavily critical of Meta, which banned him in 2021 for what it described as his praise for people engaged in violence during the 6 January riots at the US Capitol. The president and his allies also accused the firm of co-operating with the Biden administration to supress reports concerning allegations about Bidens son, Hunter, and some content surrounding the Covid pandemic. Mr Zuckerberg said he regretted the decision. In August, Trump wrote in a book that Mr Zuckerberg would spend the rest of his life in prison if he attempted to interfere in the 2024 presidential election. Since Trumps election win in early November, though, Mr Zuckerberg appears to have curried favour with him, dining with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence at the end of the month and donating 1m (786,000) towards his inauguration a few weeks later. Meta also said earlier this month that it would end third-party fact-checking in favour of an approach similar to Xs community notes, in an apparent attempt to address some of Trumps prior criticisms. The company said this marked a return to its fundamental commitment to free expression. Source: BBC --Agencies",

The Examinations Department said that approximately 323,900 students had applied while 319,284 had sat for the exam. Meanwhile, a total of 51,244 students have achieved marks above the cutoff mark of the exam, it said. It further said that appeals for the scrutiny of results are requested to be submitted online between January 27 and February 06, 2025. Speaking in Parliament today (23), Prime Minister and the Minister of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education Dr. Harini Amarasuriya had assured that the results of the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination would be released as soon as possible. Responding to a question raised regarding the matter in the Parliament, the Prime Minister stated that the situation which led to the delay in the releasing of results was a misfortune, adding that the answer sheets evaluation activities of the examination are currently underway. However, she assured that the release of results and the process of admission of students to Grade 06 will be expedited. An investigation was launched on September 20, 2024, by the Department of Examinations after allegations surfaced regarding the leakage of three questions from the 2024 Grade 5 Scholarship Examination. While the initial probe revealed only three questions were leaked, the controversy escalated as some parents, staging protests and holding press conferences, claimed that the entire question paper had been compromised. Following this, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) took over the investigation, uncovering that the Director of the Planning Division of the National Institute of Education (NIE) and a school teacher were involved in the incident. Both were arrested and remanded until October 22. In response to the public outcry, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake intervened, leading to the suspension of the evaluation of answer sheets until the investigation was concluded. On October 14, Commissioner General of Examinations Amith Jayasundara announced that the examination would not be re-conducted, and free marks would be awarded for the three leaked questions. However, in November, the Supreme Court issued an interim order halting the release of the 2024 Grade 5 Scholarship Examination results until further proceedings. On December 31, 2024, the Supreme Court declared that fundamental human rights had been violated through the Cabinet of Ministers decision to award free marks to all students for the three questions of the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination which are alleged to have been leaked. Accordingly, the court also ordered the Commissioner General of Examinations to immediately implement a suitable recommendation out of the three recommendations made by the experts committee appointed to look into the matter. Later on, the Commissioner General of Examinations, Amith Jayasundara announced that it was decided to award free marks to all students for the three questions which were alleged to have been leaked in the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination, as per the Supreme Court verdict pertaining to the case.",

        "date": "January 23, 2025 09:58 pm",
        "content": "Micheál Martin became Irelands taoiseach (prime minister) for the second time in his political career on Thursday, a day later than planned. The Irish parliament descended into uproar on Wednesday, its first day back in session after weeks of political horse-trading and coalition-building, following the countrys general election in November. Wednesdays order of business was scheduled to start with the vote to elect a new taoiseach but this formality was delayed repeatedly. It was then ultimately abandoned for the day, as opposition parties took to their feet in loud protest over the granting of extended speaking rights to independent parliamentarians who support the incoming government. Attempts to resolve the dispute continued into Thursday morning when the government acknowledged that there was ambiguity in speaking rights and an agreement was reached that government-supporting independents cannot for now retain extended speaking rights from the opposition benches. The 64-year-old Martin, leader of the Fianna Fáil party, was finally elected taoiseach before 2 p.m. in Dublin, saying it was a profound honor to be nominated to serve as head of the government in a free, democratic and diverse republic. Martin stressed the importance of Irelands relationships with Europe, the United States and the United Kingdom, noting that his nations kinship with the US went back to before the formation of the Irish state and endures because we have continued to renew bonds of respect and cooperation. The Ireland-America relationship is one that benefits us both and will emerge strongly no matter what, Martin told the packed chamber of parliament. Although Irelands November election bucked the 2024 trend that saw so many countries reject incumbent governments, no political party had a resounding win. The countrys center-right Fianna Fáil party won the most seats on November 29 but did not secure enough for a parliamentary majority. It returned to its most recent coalition partnership with the countrys other centrist party, Fine Gael, and spent recent weeks in pursuit of further political backing. Last week it was announced that the two parties had secured the support of a group of regional independent lawmakers and was ready to form a government. Martin becomes Irish taoiseach for the second time. He first assumed the office when Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil entered their coalition government in 2020, joining forces against a surge in support for Sinn Féin, Irelands nationalist party. That groundbreaking partnership between Irelands long-time vying parties saw party leaders Leo Varadkar and Martin swap the roles of prime minister and deputy every two years until Varadkar unexpectedly stepped down last year. He was replaced by Simon Harris, who became Irelands youngest ever leader. Harris, the outgoing taoiseach, assumed the role of deputy prime minister Thursday, and will expect to step back into the role of Irelands leader again in 2027. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "date": "January 24, 2025 06:45 am",
        "content": "Police have arrested a 23-year-old suspect involved in a series of thefts at the World Trade Center (WTC) in Colombo. The suspect, identified as Khalid Riyal Muheideen, a Sudanese national of Eritrean origin, targeted four offices on the 26th floor of the East Tower during the early hours of January 17. Police investigations revealed that the man, who appeared well-dressed and wore a face mask, had entered the WTC at approximately 1.00 a.m. on the day of the thefts. CCTV footage captured him using keys retrieved from keyboards to access the offices, where he stole laptops and mobile phones valued at nearly Rs. 3 million. A peculiar clue led investigators to the breakthroughas after committing the thefts, the suspect wrote the word BATMAN on the walls of each office. This prompted officers to analyze CCTV footage and review social media profiles of individuals previously associated with the WTC, as the police suspected that the individual must be a previous employee at the WTC. Their attention was drawn to a Facebook account featuring several BATMAN images, which led them to identify Muheideen as the prime suspect. He was arrested near a major casino in Colombo. During questioning, Muheideen confessed to the crimes, explaining that his familiarity with the WTCs layout and security systems came from his father, who had operated a fish export consultancy business at the WTC years ago. He also admitted to selling the stolen items at a low price to fund his gambling at casinos. Fort Police has recovered the stolen goods and continue to investigate the case.",

        "title": "US judge blocks Trumps executive order redefining birthright citizenship",
        "date": "January 24, 2025 07:01 am",
        "content": "A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked President Donald Trumps executive order denying U.S. citizenship to the children of parents living in the country illegally, calling it blatantly unconstitutional during the first hearing in a multi-state effort challenging the order. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution promises citizenship to those born on U.S. soil, a measure ratified in 1868 to ensure citizenship for former slaves after the Civil War. But in an effort to curb unlawful immigration, Trump issued the executive order just after being sworn in for his second term on Monday. The order would deny citizenship to those born after Feb. 19 whose parents are in the country illegally. It also forbids U.S. agencies from issuing any document or accepting any state document recognizing citizenship for such children. Trumps order drew immediate legal challenges across the country, with at least five lawsuits being brought by 22 states and a number of immigrants rights groups. A lawsuit brought by Washington, Arizona, Oregon and Illinois was the first to get a hearing. Ive been on the bench for over four decades. I cant remember another case where the question presented was as clear as this one is, U.S. District Judge John Coughenour told a Justice Department attorney. This is a blatantly unconstitutional order. Thursdays decision prevents the Trump administration from taking steps to implement the executive order for 14 days. In the meantime, the parties will submit further arguments about the merits of Trumps order. Coughenour scheduled a hearing on Feb. 6 to decide whether to block it long term as the case proceeds. Coughenour, 84, a Ronald Reagan appointee who was nominated to the federal bench in 1981, grilled the DOJ attorney, Brett Shumate, asking whether Shumate personally believed the order was constitutional. I have difficulty understanding how a member of the bar could state unequivocally that this is a constitutional order, he added. Shumate assured the judge he did  absolutely. He said the arguments the Trump administration is making now have never previously been litigated, and that there was no reason to issue a 14-day temporary restraining order when it would expire before the executive order takes effect. The Department of Justice later said in a statement that it will vigorously defend the presidents executive order, which it said correctly interprets the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. We look forward to presenting a full merits argument to the Court and to the American people, who are desperate to see our Nations laws enforced, the department said. The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship  the principle of jus soli or right of the soil  is applied. Most are in the Americas, and Canada and Mexico are among them. The 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868, in the aftermath of the Civil War, to ensure citizenship for former slaves and free African Americans. It states: All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. Trumps order asserts that the children of noncitizens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and therefore not entitled to citizenship. Arguing for the states on Thursday, Washington assistant attorney general Lane Polozola called that absurd, noting that neither those who have immigrated illegally nor their children are immune from U.S. law. Are they not subject to the decisions of the immigration courts? Polozola asked. Must they not follow the law while they are here? Polozola also said the restraining order was warranted because, among other reasons, the executive order would immediately start requiring the states to spend millions to revamp health care and benefits systems to reconsider an applicants citizenship status. The executive order will impact hundreds of thousands of citizens nationwide who will lose their citizenship under this new rule, Polozola said. Births cannot be paused while the court considers this case. Washington Attorney General Nick Brown told reporters afterward he was not surprised that Coughenour had little patience with the Justice Departments position, considering that the Citizenship Clause arose from one of the darkest chapters of American law, the Supreme Courts 1857 Dred Scott decision, which held that African Americans, whether enslaved or free, were not entitled to citizenship. Babies are being born today, tomorrow, every day, all across this country, and so we had to act now, Brown said. He added that it has been the law of the land for generations, that you are an American citizen if you are born on American soil, period. Nothing that the president can do will change that, he said. A key case involving birthright citizenship unfolded in 1898. The Supreme Court held that Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrants, was a U.S. citizen because he was born in the country. After a trip abroad, he had faced being denied reentry by the federal government on the grounds that he wasnt a citizen under the Chinese Exclusion Act. But some advocates of immigration restrictions have argued that case clearly applied to children born to parents who were both legal immigrants. They say its less clear whether it applies to children born to parents living in the country illegally. Trumps order prompted attorneys general to share their personal connections to birthright citizenship. Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, for instance, a U.S. citizen by birthright and the nations first Chinese American elected attorney general, said the lawsuit was personal for him. Later Thursday, he said Coughenour made the right decision. There is no legitimate legal debate on this question. But the fact that Trump is dead wrong will not prevent him from inflicting serious harm right now on American families like my own, Tong said this week. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "January 24, 2025 08:57 am",
        "content": "Former President Maithripala Sirisena has called on the government to expedite the construction of canals to divert excess water from the Moragahakanda and Kalu Ganga reservoirs to Anuradhapura and the North Western Province, highlighting the urgent need to mitigate flood damage in the Polonnaruwa District. The Polonnaruwa District has been severely affected by recent heavy rains, which have destroyed crops, damaged property, and caused significant hardship for residents. Sirisena attributed the devastation to the lack of proper infrastructure to manage water flow from the reservoirs. In 2019, approximately 15 to 20 kilometers of canals were constructed to carry water from Moragahakanda to Anuradhapura and the North West. However, from 2019 to 2024, the construction of these vital canals stalled completely under subsequent governments, Sirisena said in his statement. He stressed that had the canals been completed during that period, Polonnaruwa would not have suffered such extensive destruction. Instead, the water overflow now falls into the Mahaweli River, with large volumes ultimately flowing into the sea, wasting valuable resources that could otherwise support agricultural development. Sirisena urged the current administration to prioritize the construction of the remaining canals, emphasizing their importance in preventing future flood damage and enhancing agricultural output in the North Western Province and Anuradhapura District. The government must act promptly to ensure that this vital water does not go to waste. By diverting it effectively, we can alleviate the suffering in Polonnaruwa and boost agricultural development in the affected regions, he added.",

Selvaperunthagai said on Thursday that the committee would recommend to the State government to facilitate the return of refugees who wish to go back to Sri Lanka. The committee members, including MLAs J. Mohamed Shahnawaz, Agri Krishnamurthy, C.V.M.P. Ezhilarasan, S. Chandran, Kadarbatcha Muthuramalingam, S. Murugesan and R.M.

The refugees, who came here from the island nation following economic crisis, had been provided shelter by the State government since the last two or three years. Around 280 people, including women and children, lived there. Following representations to the PAC chairperson, Mr. Selvaperunthagai, who is the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president, told presspersons that they would recommend to the government to take steps for safe return of the refugees to Sri Lanka as per the law.

        "title": "Emilia Pérez tops Oscar nominations with 13",
        "date": "January 24, 2025 10:34 am",
        "content": "In the wake of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles that struck at the heart of the movie industry, an embattled Hollywood lined up behind the Netflix narco-musical about trans identity Emilia Pérez in Oscar nominations Thursday. Jacques Audiards Emilia Pérez, a Spanish-language, French-made film, dominated the nominations with a leading 13 nominations, including best picture and best actress for Karla Sofía Gascón, making her the first openly trans actor ever nominated for an Oscar. The film also landed nominations for directing, original screenplay, two for its songs and for Zoe Saldaña s supporting performance. This recognition is a celebration of the global world we live in, Audiard said in a statement. Netflix, despite its starring role in Hollywood, has never won best picture. Many of its top contenders have previously racked up large numbers of nominations (including Mank, The Irishman and Roma) but gone home with only a handful of trophies. Emilia Pérez, though, may be its best chance yet. It became the most nominated non-English language film ever, surpassing Netflixs own Roma, which landed 10 nominations. Only three films  All About Eve, Titanic and La La Land  have scored more nominations in Academy Awards history. Another musical  Wicked, the smash Broadway adaptation  came away with nearly as many nominations. Jon M. Chus lavish Wizard of Oz riff collected 10 nominations, including best picture and acting nods for its stars, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. The Brutalist, Brady Corbets postwar epic filmed in VistaVision and released by A24, also came away with a commanding 10 nominations, including best picture, best director and acting nominations for Adrien Brody, Guy Pearce and Felicity Jones. The 10 nominees for best picture are: Anora; The Brutalist; A Complete Unknown; Conclave; Dune: Part Two; Emilia Pérez; Im Still Here.; Nickel Boys; The Substance and Wicked. Last year, Oppenheimer rolled. This year is different In a wide-open Oscar race, the six most honored films  Emilia Pérez, Wicked, The Brutalist, Anora (six nominations) Conclave (eight nominations) and A Complete Unknown (eight nominations)  all fared as expected. The biggest surprises were the Brazilian film Im Still Here, a portrait of political resistance under Brazils military dictatorship that also landed Fernanda Torres a best actress nomination, and RaMell Ross Nickel Boys, a daringly crafted first-person POV-shot drama that reconsiders how Black life and pain is depicted on screen. Nickel Boys director RaMell Ross watched the nominations with popcorn Thursday morning in Providence, Rhode Island. This film forces a subjective response. It forces someone to speak their mind, said Ross. This film is a film that needs discourse. Its a film thats built for discourse. The film is a discourse amongst itself. I cant wait to do it more. Those nominees likely displaced a few best picture possibilities in the prison drama Sing Sing, the journalism thriller September 5 and the tender comedy A Real Pain, though those films all landed nominations elsewhere. One of 2024s most audacious films, The Apprentice landed a surprising pair of nominations, for Sebastian Stan and Jeremy Strong. The film dramatizes the formative years of President Donald Trump (Stan) in New York real estate under the tutelage of attorney Roy Cohn (Strong). Trump has called those involved with the film human scum. He called us human scum, and I actually feel afraid talking to you about that right now. And that is an alarming feeling to be having in this country in 2025, Strong said by phone Thursday from his home in Brooklyn. On a level of artistry, today, for me personally, is an incredible day and I feel very happy, Strong added of his first Oscar nomination. And I have complicated feelings about the character I played. It was the role of a lifetime and at the same time his legacy is real and its playing out in situ in front of our eyes in very frightening ways. In the best actor category, where Stan and Brody were nominated, the other nominees were Timothée Chalamet (A Complete Unknown), Colman Domingo (Sing Sing) and Ralph Fiennes (Conclave). Most notably left out was Daniel Craig, acclaimed for his very un-James Bond performance in Queer. Best actress, a category that Demi Moore has appeared to have locked up for her full-bodied performance in The Substance, saw nominations for Moore, Gascón, Torres, Erivo and the star of Anora, Mikey Madison. Arguably the years most competitive category, that left out Marianne Jean-Baptiste (Hard Truths), Pamela Anderson, (The Last Showgirl), Nicole Kidman (Babygirl) and Angelina Jolie (Maria). Im a Los Angeles native and so theres been so much devastation these past few weeks and my heart breaks for LA. but its really beautiful to see everyone coming together, Madison said Thursday. Hollywood coming together and celebrating film right now is really beautiful. In the directing category, The Substance filmmaker Coralie Fargeat managed to crack into the otherwise all-male group of Sean Baker (Anora), Corbet, Audiard and James Mangold (A Complete Unknown). Most had expected Edward Berger to be nominated for directing the papal thriller Conclave. Supporting actor was led by Kieran Culkin, the favorite for the award, for his performance in A Real Pain. The other nominees were: Yura Borisov (Anora), Guy Pearce (The Brutalist), Edward Norton (A Complete Unknown) and Strong. Supporting actress nominations went to Grande, Saldaña, Jones, Monica Barbaro (A Complete Unknown) and Isabella Rossellini (Conclave). Oscars push ahead, despite fires The nominations had originally been planned for Jan. 17. But after wildfires on Jan. 7 began burning through the Pacific Palisades, Altadena and other areas around Los Angeles, leaving behind historic levels of destruction, the academy extended its voting window and twice postponed the nominations announcement. Fresh fires outside Los Angeles continued during the nominations, announced by Bowen Yang and Rachel Sennott. With so many in the film industry reeling, some called on the academy to cancel the Oscars altogether. Academy leaders have argued the March 2 ceremony must go ahead, for their economic impact on Los Angeles and as a symbol of resilience. Organizers have vowed this years awards will celebrate the work that unites us as a global film community and acknowledge those who fought so bravely against the wildfires. We will reflect on the recent events while highlighting the strength, creativity, and optimism that defines Los Angeles and our industry, Bill Kramer, academy chief executive, and Janet Yang, president, said in an email to members Wednesday. But much of the usual frothiness Hollywoods awards season has been severely curtailed due to the fires. The film academy canceled its annual nominees luncheon. Other events have been postponed or downsized. On Wednesday, Kramer and Yang said original song nominees wont be performed this year. Conan OBrien, whose Pacific Palisades home was spared by the fires, is hosting. Blockbusters (mostly) sit it out The Oscar nominations followed an up-and-down year for Hollywood that saw expansive post-strike delays, wide swaths of unemployed workers due to an industry-wide production slowdown and the tragedy of the fires. Most humbling, perhaps, was the presidential election that returned Trump to office in a race where podcaster Joe Rogan seemed to hold more sway than all A-listers combined. At the same time, even amid a downturn for the superhero film, the industry rallied behind some galvanizing hits, including Universal Pictures Wicked, and three Walt Disney Co. 1 billion grossers in Inside Out 2, Deadpool and Wolverine and Moana 2. Those films missed nominations except for Inside Out 2, which joined the best animated nominees of The Wild Robot, Flow, Memoir of a Snail and Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl. Otherwise, the biggest hits to join the Oscar mix were Wicked (710.3 million worldwide) and Dune: Part Two (714.6 million). Netflix doesnt report box office, so Emilia Pérez has no tallied ticket sales, and hasnt been among the streamers top watches, either. That uncertain state of the movies seemed to be reflected in the nominations, which were spread across films both widely seen and little noticed, theatrically released and predominantly streaming. Several movies that studios and streamers had declined to release  including The Apprentice and the Israeli-Palestinian documentary No Other Land, which still lacks a distributor  were vindicated with nominations. But unlike last year, when Hollywood rallied around the success of Oppenheimer, this year offered up no clear frontrunner for the industrys top honor. With five weeks to go until the Oscar ceremony, at least four or five movies  including The Brutalist, Emilia Pérez, Anora, Conclave and Wicked  are seen having a shot at best picture.

        "date": "January 24, 2025 10:55 am",
        "content": "The Commissioner General of Examinations Amith Jayasundara says that the highest score achieved in the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination across Sri Lanka is 188. Speaking at a press conference held this morning (24), Jayasundara noted that while one student scored the top mark of 188, several candidates achieved scores of 187, 186, and so on. Commenting further in this regard, the Exams Commissioner General highlighted that this years highest score is relatively lower compared to previous years, noting that in past examinations, the top scores typically exceeded 195, with a perfect score of 200 achieved in 2020. However, the exams chief attributed this decline to a possible increased difficulty level of the question paper in 2024. Furthermore, Jayasundara highlighted the immense mental pressure placed on 10-year-old students by this highly competitive examination, a situation that he noted is not commonly found in other countries. He emphasized the importance of finding an alternative to the Grade 05 Scholarship Examination to achieve its objectives without putting undue stress on young children. Until such an alternative is implemented, however, the examination will continue, he said, noting that to mitigate pressure on students, the Department of Examinations has decided not to disclose the names of the highest-scoring candidates this year. The results of the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination were released online last evening (23) and can be viewed on the departments official website: www.doenets.lk. Meanwhile, the highest district cut-off mark is also set at a relatively lower mark this year, which is 143. The 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination was held on September 15 at 2,849 centres across the island. The Examinations Department said that approximately 323,900 students had applied while 319,284 had sat for the exam. Meanwhile, a total of 51,244 students have achieved marks above the cutoff mark of the exam, it said. It further said that appeals for the scrutiny of results are requested to be submitted online between January 27 and February 06, 2025.",

        "date": "January 24, 2025 11:33 am",
        "content": "South Sudanese authorities have suspended access to social media platforms for a minimum of 30 days after videos depicting the alleged killings of South Sudanese nationals in Sudans El Gezira state triggered riots and deadly revenge attacks. The block was to be implemented at midnight on Wednesday, Napoleon Adok, director general of the National Communications Authority, wrote in a letter dated Wednesday to internet service providers. This is culminating from the recent upheaval in Sudan, that has exposed the South Sudanese population to unprecedented levels of extreme violence through social media posts, Adok wrote in the letter seen by Reuters. Customers of mobile operators MTN South Sudan and Zain would not be able to access Facebook, TikTok and other platforms for a maximum period of 90 days, the companies said in statements issued on Wednesday. A Reuters reporter in Juba was unable to access Facebook or TikTok. At least 16 Sudanese nationals were killed last week when riots erupted in South Sudans capital Juba and elsewhere in the country. Youths in several cities looted and vandalised shops owned by Sudanese nationals and burned several homes, police said, in retaliation for what they believed was the involvement of Sudans military and allied groups in the killings in El Gezira. The Sudanese army has condemned what it called individual violations in El Gezira. The effect is a bit huge because as an artist, I depend so much on social media, said Isaac Anthony Lumori, also known as Mc Lumoex, a popular South Sudanese musician and founder of a comedy show. My message to the government is to seek an amicable way of solving this issue, especially engaging the government of Sudan to make sure that (their) army does not misbehave to the extent of taking human life, he told Reuters.

        "date": "January 24, 2025 11:39 am",
        "content": "A rare plant known as the corpse flower bloomed in Sydney on Friday for the first time in more than a decade, emitting an odour likened to rotting flesh and delighting thousands who queued for a whiff. For the past week, curiosity seekers have been visiting the specimen nicknamed Putricia  a combination of putrid and Patricia  at the citys Royal Botanic Garden. The institution stayed open until midnight on Thursday to accommodate the crowd. The corpse flowers scientific name is amorphophallus titanum and is called bunga bangkai in Indonesia, where it is found in the wild. The oversize flower features fluted crimson petals and can measure more than a metre (3 feet) across with a pointed centre stalk that can top 3 metres (10 feet). The plant typically does not bloom more than once every few years and it lasts only about a day. A specimen has not bloomed in Sydney since 2010. As the long-awaited unfurling of Putricias petals began on Thursday afternoon, queues lengthened and visitors waited as long as three hours. The fact that its so huge, it takes so long to bloom, and it smells so foul really attracts people to it, Sydney Botanic Gardens chief scientist Brett Summerell said. I liken the smell to a dead possum, he said. Sydney resident Rebecca McGee-Collett, who waited 90 minutes to see the flower on Thursday evening, said the flower was beautiful but the smell was like hot garbage. A live stream of the plant has accumulated close to one million hits. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The officers of the Bribery Commission arrested a businessman and the former Western Provincial Council member while accepting a bribe of Rs. 09 million from another businessman at Pita Kotte on December 28, 2024. This arrest was made based on a complaint lodged by a resident of the Madiwela area of Kotte, the Bribery Commission said. Subsequently, he was produced before Colombo Additional Magistrate and was ordered to be remanded until today (06). The duo had allegedly solicited the bribe on the promise of expediting compensation for a land of the complainants relative in Torington Avenue, which was acquired by the Urban Development Authority (UDA), according the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC).",

        "date": "January 24, 2025 12:46 pm",
        "content": "Incumbent Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) President Shammi Silva is set to be re-elected to the top post for his third successive two-year term during the Boards Annual General Meeting (AGM) to be held on March 31, Indian media reported. In the list of nominations declared by SLCs election committee for the election of office bearers for 2025-27 term, Silva will only face friendly fire from his own camp. Therefore, he is assured of re-election at the AGM on March 31, according to analysts. In December last year, Silva succeeded Indias current ICC Chairman Jay Shah as the Asian Cricket Council boss. A businessman, Silva clashed with the then Sri Lanka sports minister Roshan Ranasinghe in 2023. The ministers appointment of an interim committee due to a purported personal clash with Silva caused Sri Lankas suspension from the ICC. As an immediate fall out of the ICC suspension, the U-19 Mens World Cup scheduled to be held in Sri Lanka in January last year was shifted to South Africa. The sports minister was later sacked and the court reinstated the SLC administration of Silva. Since Sri Lanka won the 1996 World Cup, the cash-rich bodys positions became a matter of prestige for the local business leaders. There have been much acrimony at annual elections among rival camps. In 1998, the involvement of the then Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratungas security division at the AGM caused fisticuffs between rival factions. Source: PTI --Agencies",

        "date": "January 24, 2025 01:06 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas Charith Asalanka has been named the captain of the ICC Mens ODI Team of the Year for 2024, with Kusal Mendis included as the wicketkeeper while Pathum Nissanka and Wanindu Hasaranga are also part of the team. The ICC Mens ODI Team of the Year 2024 not only offers quality, as expected, but also a great balance of star power, consistency and versatility. Pathum Nissanka (Sri Lanka) 12 Matches, 694 Runs, 210 Highest Score, 63.1 Average, 106.4 Strike Rate, 3 Centuries, 2 Half-Centuries Nissankas 210 in February against Afghanistan was the 6th-highest score by an opener in ODI history, setting up his strong season for the Lions. Much of his production came in the front half of the year, tonning up twice when Afghanistan toured and then again in Bangladesh in March. Nissanka scored the second-most One-Day International runs in 2024, behind only team-mate Kusal Mendis. Kusal Mendis (WK) (Sri Lanka) 17 Matches, 742 Runs, 143 Highest Score, 53 Average, 90.6 Strike Rate, 1 Century, 6 Half-Centuries Mendis 742 runs were the most scored of any player in ODIs in 2024. His highest score, a 143 against New Zealand in November, was the 27th-highest total by a wicketkeeper in ODI history. He finished the calendar year with a bang, notching up a total of 217 runs in Sri Lankas two ODIs against the Black Caps. Mendis consistency was undeniable, only failing to reach double figures once from 17 innings. Charith Asalanka (C) (Sri Lanka) 16 Matches, 605 Runs, 101 Highest Score, 50.2 Average, 97.1 Strike Rate, 1 Century, 4 Half-Centuries Sri Lankans scoring ODI runs was undoubtedly a theme in 2024, with Asalanka being no exception. He started the year with a ton against Zimbabwe, his only century of the calendar year, but proceeded to contribute handsomely with the bat, reaching 50 on four separate occasions  two of those scores in the 90s. Asalanka also took three wickets in two of Sri Lankas three series games against India. Wanindu Hasaranga (Sri Lanka) 10 Matches, 26 Wickets, 15.6 Bowling Average, 719 Best Bowling Hasarangas 719 against Zimbabwe in January is the fifth-best return in an innings in ODI history, joining an elite club of bowlers that have taken seven scalps in a match. He averaged 2.6 wickets per game in 2024 and kept his bowling average well under 20. Shaheen Shah Afridi (Pakistan) 6 Matches, 15 Wickets, 17.6 Bowling Average, 447 Best Bowling Shaheen Shah Afridi made a big impact despite playing only six ODIs in the calendar year. Possessing one of world crickets best bowling strike rates, he continued to prove himself as one of the most consistent performers at the international level. Haris Rauf (Pakistan) 8 Matches, 13 Wickets, 22.4 Bowling Average, 529 Best Bowling Rauf finished 2024 firing on all cylinders, taking 10 wickets across Pakistans three-ODI series in Australia, which included his five-for in Adelaide  a contest the touring team ended up winning comfortably. AM Ghazanfar (Afghanistan) 11 Matches, 21 Wickets, 13.57 Average, 626 Best Bowling Rising star alert. 18-year-old AM Ghazanfar had an incredible 2024, after making his ODI debut in March against Ireland. The off-spinner became the fifth-youngest Mens player to take a five-for in an ODI, picking up 626 against Bangladesh in November. He recorded another five-wicket haul in his last ODI appearance of 2024, grabbing 533 against Harare in December. Ghazanfar has already become an important member of Afghanistans team and will be pivotal for their upcoming Champions Trophy claims. Azmatullah Omarzai (Afghanistan) 12 Matches, 417 Runs, 149 Highest Score, 52.1 Average, 105.6 Strike Rate, 1 Century, 3 Half-Centuries, 17 Wickets, 418 Best Bowling Omarzais all-round contribution was of great use to Afghanistan throughout 2024 in ODIs, combining high-end batting production with some very useful bowling performances. In the third and deciding ODI against Bangladesh in November, with the series locked up at 1-1, he took 437 with the ball and followed that up with an innings of 70 not out to steer them to a five-wicket win with 10 balls to spare. Sherfane Rutherford (West Indies) 9 Matches, 425 Runs, 113 Highest Score, 106.2 Average, 120.1 Strike Rate, 1 Century, 4 Half-Centuries What a star. Rutherford played in nine ODIs in 2024, after only making his debut in December 2023, yet scored runs for fun. The 26-year-old from Guyana scored 425 runs, well faster than a run-a-ball, from seven innings for the West Indies. Rutherford played the middle-order role to perfection, finishing unbeaten on three separate occasions. His lowest score for the year was 24 and his run of five straight innings reaching 50 is the 13th-best streak in ODIs. Rahmanullah Gurbaz (Afghanistan) 11 Matches, 531 Runs, 121 Highest Score, 48.2 Average, 89.7 Strike Rate, 3 Centuries, 2 Half-Centuries Rahmanullah Gurbaz continues to produce the game-wrecking performances hes been known for ever since his famous century on debut in 2021.

Saim Ayub (Pakistan) 9 Matches, 515 Runs, 113 no Highest Score, 64.37 Average, 105.53 Strike Rate, 3 Centuries, 1 Half-century What a breakout season its been for the Pakistan southpaw, capped off by selection at the top of the order in the ICC Mens ODI Team of the Year. Saim only debuted in November, but arrived immediately, scoring a combined 125 runs from three One-Day Internationals in Australia, before scoring a maiden ODI ton in Zimbabwe shortly after. Three of his last five innings have produced centuries, including two in South Africa in December, a three-match series that saw him average 78.3. --ICC--",

Speaking on the matter, Deputy Minister Kodituwakku stated, This process is carried out under specific criteria. These 323 containers were released through a committee of three members. It is impractical to inspect and release all 2,000 containers that arrive at the port daily, so a portion is cleared without inspection to ease congestion. However, this issue cannot be resolved without expanding to new yards. The release of these containers has sparked controversy following revelations by the Customs Trade Union Alliance.

In his petition, the former President says that as the leader who provided leadership to end the war that lasted for almost three decades in the country, he is facing terrorist threats and that there have also been threats to his life.

Sri Lanka opened the probe into the Groups local projects, the AFP reported, after U.S. authorities indicted billionaire Gautam Adani and other group executives in November on bribery and other charges, all of which the Group has denied. While President Anura Kumara Dissanayakes cabinet has revoked the 20-year deal power purchase deal signed in May 2024, it has not cancelled the project and has appointed a committee to review the project, the AFP reported, citing an official document and an energy ministry official. Sri Lankas Power and Energy Ministry declined to comment. But two ministry sources told Reuters they were still reviewing the project and the power purchase deal had not been revoked. The Adani Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The U.S. allegations had raised concerns among some partners and investors of the group, with at least one Indian state reviewing its power deal with Adani and TotalEnergies halting further investments in the conglomerate. Overseas, Kenya has scrapped more than 2.5 billion in deals with the Adani Group, including contracts to develop an airport and build power transmission lines, after the U.S. indictment. Under the power purchase deal, Adani Green Energy was to build two 484 megawatts wind power stations in the South Asian island nations northern province, with a total investment of 442 million. The company would be paid 8.26 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh). The cash-strapped country, which has suffered from crippling power blackouts and fuel shortages, has been trying to speed green power generation to hedge against surges in imported fuel costs. The Adani Group is also involved in building a 700 million terminal project at Sri Lankas largest port in Colombo. Adani Green Energy shares were trading 1 lower in Mumbai.

JAAF points out the sector has demonstrated resilience over the past five years despite the pandemic-induced dip in 2020 when exports plummeted to 4.1bn,  a 22 drop from 2019. After peaking temporarily in 2022 due to overestimated post-Covid recovery expectations, the industry faced challenges again in 2023 due to inflationary pressures and reduced consumer spending. The current years growth also reflects pricing pressures faced by the industry. At the same time, key trends in market performance suggest encouraging developments. --Agencies",

        "title": "Hamas set to release four Israeli soldier hostages in second swap",
        "date": "January 25, 2025 07:52 am",
        "content": "The Palestinian militant movement Hamas is expected to release four female Israeli soldiers on Saturday in exchange for a group of Palestinian prisoners under a ceasefire agreement aimed at ending the 15-month-old war in Gaza. The four soldiers - Karina Ariev, Daniela Gilboa, Naama Levy and Liri Albag - were all stationed at an observation post on the edge of Gaza and abducted by Hamas fighters who overran their base during the attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The Hamas prisoners media office said it expected 200 prisoners to be freed on Saturday as part of the exchange, including 120 serving life sentences and 80 prisoners with other lengthy sentences. Saturdays exchange would be the second since the ceasefire began Sunday and Hamas handed over three Israeli civilians in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas identified on Friday the four hostages to be released in the second swap. But Israel has not commented officially and may not do so until it actually receives them. The ceasefire agreement, worked out after months of on-off negotiations brokered by Qatar and Egypt and backed by the United States, has halted the fighting for the first time since a truce that lasted just a week in November 2023. In the first six-week phase of the deal, Hamas has agreed to release 33 hostages, including children, women, older men and the sick and injured, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, while Israeli troops pull back from some of their positions in the Gaza Strip. In a subsequent phase, the two sides would negotiate the exchange of the remaining hostages, including men of military age, and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, which lies largely in ruins after 15 months of fighting and Israeli bombardment. Israel launched its campaign in Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, when militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, more than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to health authorities there. After the release on Sunday of hostages Romi Gonen, Emily Damari and Doron Steinbrecher and the recovery of the body of an Israeli soldier missing for a decade, Israel says 94 Israelis and foreigners remain held in Gaza, though it is unclear how many of them are still alive.

        "title": "Belarus election is poised to extend the 30-year rule of Europes last dictator",
        "date": "January 25, 2025 10:42 am",
        "content": "The last time Belarus staged a presidential election in 2020, authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko was declared the winner with 80 of the vote. That triggered cries of fraud, months of protests and a harsh crackdown with thousands of arrests. Not wanting to risk such unrest again by those opposing his three decades of iron-fisted rule, Lukashenko advanced the timing of the 2025 election  from the warmth of August to frigid January, when demonstrators are less likely to fill the streets. With many of his political opponents either jailed or exiled abroad, the 70-year-old Lukashenko is back on the ballot, and when the election concludes on Sunday, he is all but certain to add a seventh term as the only leader most people in post-Soviet Belarus have ever known. Heres what to know about Belarus, its election and its relationship with Russia: Europes last dictator and his reliance on Russia Belarus was part of the Soviet Union until its collapse in 1991. The Slavic nation of 9 million people is sandwiched between Russia and Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, the latter three all NATO members. It was overrun by Nazi Germany in World War II. Its been closely allied with Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin  himself in power for a quarter century. Lukashenko, a former state farm director, was first elected in 1994, riding public anger over a catastrophic plunge in living standards after chaotic and painful free-market reforms. He promised to combat corruption. Throughout his rule, hes relied on subsidies and political support from Russia, allowing it to use Belarusian territory to invade Ukraine in 2022 and later agreeing to host some of Russias tactical nuclear weapons. Lukashenko was dubbed Europes last dictator early in his tenure, and he has lived up to that nickname, harshly silencing dissent and extending his rule through elections that the West has called neither free nor fair. An open admirer of the Soviet Union, he has restored Soviet-style controls on the economy, discouraged use of the Belarusian language in favor of Russian, and pushed for abandoning the countrys red-and-white national flag in favor of one similar to what it used as a Soviet republic. Belarus top security agency kept its fearsome Soviet-era name of the KGB, and its the only country in Europe to keep the death penalty, with executions carried out with a gunshot to the back of the head. Flirtation with the West, repression at home As he bargained with the Kremlin over the years for more subsidies, Lukashenko periodically tried to appease the West by easing repressions. Such flirtations ended after he unleashed a violent suppression of dissent after the 2020 election. That election to his sixth term was widely seen at home and abroad as rigged, and it sparked months of massive protests, the largest ever seen in Belarus. Authorities responded with a sweeping crackdown in which over 65,000 people were arrested, thousands were beaten by police and hundreds of independent media outlets and nongovernmental organizations were closed and outlawed, drawing Western sanctions. Leading opposition figures have either been imprisoned or fled the country. Human rights activists say Belarus holds about 1,300 political prisoners, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski, the founder of the countrys top rights group, Viasna. Through a brutal campaign against all dissent, the authorities have created a suffocating climate of fear, silencing anything and anyone who challenges the government, said Marie Struthers, Amnesty Internationals Eastern Europe and Central Asia director. Maneuvering before the election Although Lukashenkos current term doesnt expire until summer, the election was moved up in what officials said would allow him to exercise his powers at the initial stage of strategic planning. Belarusian political analyst Valery Karbalevich gave a different reason. There wont be mass protests in freezing January, he said. In other maneuvering, Lukashenko has recently pardoned more than 250 people described as political prisoners by rights activists. The pardons, however, come amid heightened repressions aimed at uprooting any remaining signs of dissent. Hundreds have been arrested in raids that targeted relatives and friends of political prisoners. Other arrests include participants in online chats organized by residents of apartment buildings in various cities. Katya Glod, policy fellow with the European Leadership Network, noted the election takes place in the atmosphere of fear and repression, which has been really unrelenting since 2020. Unlike the 2020 election, Lukashenko faces only token challengers, with other opposition candidates rejected for the ballot by the Central Election Commission. The election began with early voting Tuesday and concludes Sunday. The politicians who once dared to challenge Lukashenko are now literally rotting in prison in torture conditions, there has been no contact with them for over a year, and some of them are in very poor health, said Viasna representative Pavel Sapelka. Opposition leader-in-exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who challenged Lukashenko in the 2020 election and was forced to flee the country afterward, says the latest vote is a farce and urged Belarusians to vote against every candidate. Her husband, activist Siarhei Tsikhanouski, tried to run four years ago but was jailed and remains imprisoned. Under Russias nuclear umbrella In December 2024, Lukashenko and Putin signed a treaty that gave security guarantees to Belarus that included the possible use of Russian nuclear weapons. The pact followed Moscows revision of its nuclear doctrine, which for the first time placed Belarus under the Russian nuclear umbrella amid tensions with the West over the war in Ukraine. Lukashenko says Belarus is hosting dozens of Russian tactical nuclear weapons. Their deployment extends Russias capability to target Ukraine and NATO allies in Europe. He also said Belarus will prepare to host Russias Oreshnik hypersonic missile that was used in Ukraine for the first time in November. Putin said the missiles could be deployed to Belarus in the second half of 2025, remaining under Moscows control while Minsk will select the targets. Source: AP --Agencies",
