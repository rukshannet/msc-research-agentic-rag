        "date": "August 5, 2023 12:10 pm",
        "content": "The Ministry of Ports, Sipping and Aviation has decided to reconstruct the Talaimannar pier to facilitate passengers from Rameswaram, India. The move was made in a bid to further improve people-to-people ties with India, sources reported. The pier is set to be reconstructed after 37 years, with the project having an estimated cost of Rs. 1.8 billion. Issuing a statement in this regard, the Ministry revealed that parallel to the reconstruction of the pier, nearly 10 acres of state-owned land bordering the port will be acquired for the development of relevant infrastructure. It was also highlighted that a modern passenger terminal and a warehouse facility will also be constructed. Accordingly, requests for proposals to carry out these developments will be called for under a private-public partnership, the Ministry noted, adding that India has completed developments at the Rameswaram Port, and clearance has been declared to commence a passenger ferry service between Mannar and Rameswaram. Subject Minster Nimal Siripala de Silva visited the Talaimannar Pier for an inspection on Friday (04 August), during which he deemed the development of the pier essential for the strengthening of people-to-people ties between the two nations. But for that purpose, we need to repair the pier. This is a benefit we are going to give from the money we earned from the port of Colombo to the people of the North and East. Therefore I am sure when this project is implemented, there will be a lot of benefits, he said, emphasisng that this was a gesture from President Ranil Wickremeisnghe to ensure that both the North and the South are being treated equally.",

        "date": "August 5, 2023 01:45 pm",
        "content": "Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has been given three-year jail sentence over corruption allegations. Mr Khan was found guilty of not declaring money earned from selling gifts he received in office. He denies the charges and says he will appeal. After the verdict, Mr Khan was taken into custody from his home in Lahore. In a pre-recorded statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, he told his supporters: I have only one appeal, dont sit at home silently. The former cricketer-turned-politician, 70, was elected in 2018, but was ousted in a no-confidence vote last year after falling out with Pakistans powerful military. Mr Khan is facing more than 100 cases brought against him since his removal - charges he says are politically motivated. Saturdays verdict centred on charges that he incorrectly declared details of presents from foreign dignitaries and proceeds from their alleged sale. The gifts - reported to be worth more than 140m Pakistani rupees (635,000; 500,000) - included Rolex watches, a ring and a pair of cuff links. His dishonesty has been established beyond doubt, judge Humayun Dilawar wrote in his ruling. Mr Khans barrister Gohar Khan said the verdict was a murder of justice. We werent even given a chance. We werent even allowed to cross examine, to say anything in defence or conduct our arguments. I havent seen this kind of injustice before, he told Dawn newspaper. As the court decision was announced, a crowd, which included some prosecuting lawyers, began chanting Imran Khan is a thief outside the building. His party, Tehreek-e-Insaf, confirmed to the BBC that after being arrested in Lahore, Mr Khan was flown to the capital, Islamabad, to begin serving his sentence. For months he had avoided arrest, with his supporters at times fighting pitched battles with police to keep him out of custody. In May, Mr Khan was arrested for not appearing at court as requested. He was then released, with the arrest declared illegal. Since then, his party has been under intense pressure from the authorities. Many senior officials have left and thousands of supporters have been arrested, accused of being involved in the protests that followed Mr Khans arrest. When questioned by BBC HARDTalk as to whether he had created an atmosphere of hostility to the military resulting in violence, Mr Khan said he and his party had never advocated the use of violence and had a record of peaceful protest. Mr Khan said the army in Pakistan was petrified of elections which his party would win hands-down and, for that reason, theyre dismantling a democracy. Pakistans army plays a prominent role in politics, sometimes seizing power in military coups, and, on other occasions, pulling levers behind the scenes. Many analysts believe Mr Khans election win in 2018 happened with the help of the military. In opposition, he has been one of its most vocal critics, and analysts say the armys popularity has fallen. Since being ousted, Mr Khan has been campaigning for early elections. Conviction would disqualify Mr Khan from standing for office, possibly for life. Pakistans parliament will be dissolved on August 9, leaving a caretaker government to take over in the run up to the elections. No election date has been announced, although constitutionally they should take place by early November. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "date": "August 5, 2023 03:01 pm",
        "content": "Director-General of Health Services says a ministerial-level investigation would be initiated against Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) Dr. M.N. Ruhul Haq, who had conducted post-mortems including two significant ones, despite a suspension imposed by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). Dr. Haq had performed the post-mortems of the well-known late businessman Dinesh Schaffter, whose murder still remains a mystery, and the child who died at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital (LRH) for Children in Colombo following a kidney surgery. The SLMC gave Dr. Ruhul Haq (SLMC Registration 15168) an 8-month suspension with effect from December 20, 2022, after an inquiry into the complaint made by Mr. S.A. Rathnasena. The councils website mentions, The Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) has decided that commencing from the 20th of December 2022 Dr. Ruhul Haq should be imposed a suspension for a period of eight (08) months from exercising his rights, privileges and immunities conferred upon him by registration as a Medical Practitioner in terms of the provisions of the Disciplinary Regulations published in the Extraordinary Gazette Notification No 7577 dated 10th March 1993 and Medical Ordinance No. 26 of 1927 as amended. Although the suspension is supposed to come to an end on August 20, 2023, Dr. Haq was found to have been practising during this period and has performed the much-talked-about post-mortems of murdered businessman Dinesh Schaffter and Hamdi Fazleen, a three-year-old who was receiving treatment at the LRH. According to Dr. Gunawardena, on January 02, 2023, he had approved the suspension of Dr. Haq after receiving a letter from the SLMC conveying its decision. The health services chief, noting that the responsibility of implementing the suspension lies with the head of the respective institution, assured that a ministerial-level probe would be carried out into the matter. He mentioned that the Public Service Commission has been informed of the matter and that they are awaiting its response to decide on the disciplinary action that should be taken against Dr. Haq, who was previously under fire after the court ruled that the reports of the post-mortems he had performed contained contradictory findings. In the post-mortem report on Hamdi Fazleens death, Dr. Haq had mentioned that the boy was born with only one kidney  a condition called renal agenesis. However, Colombo Additional Magistrate Rajindra Jayasuriya had ordered Borella Police not to continue with the investigations based solely on Dr. Haqs forensic analysis as contradictions and obscurities in his reports had been confirmed during previous court proceedings. The Additional Magistrate had earlier stated that contradictory particulars were observed in the original report and the final report compiled by Dr. Haq after performing the post-mortem of Dinesh Schaffter. Speaking on the matter, Dr. Haq had said he had been reinstated after he appealed to the Health Ministry against the SLMCs suspension.",

        "title": "Ocean surface hits highest ever recorded temperature",
        "date": "August 5, 2023 04:45 pm",
        "content": "The surface temperature of the worlds oceans has hit its highest ever level as climate breakdown from burning fossil fuels causes the oceans to heat. Global average daily sea surface temperatures (SST) hit 20.96C this week, breaking the record of 20.95C reached in 2016, according to the Copernicus climate modelling service. Scientists say it is likely the record will continue to be broken, as usually oceans are at their hottest globally in March, not August. Dr Samantha Burgess, from Copernicus, said: The fact that weve seen the record now makes me nervous about how much warmer the ocean may get between now and next March. It is likely the temperatures are partly driven by the El Niño weather phenomenon  2016 was also an El Niño year. However, these weather patterns are probably exacerbated by climate breakdown and the heating atmosphere. The more we burn fossil fuels, the more excess heat will be taken out by the oceans, which means the longer it will take to stabilise them and get them back to where they were, Burgess told the BBC. This week, the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, announced more than 100 new oil and gas licences in the North Sea, against the advice of climate experts. Oceans also regulate the climate, soaking up heat, driving weather patterns, acting as a carbon sink and providing respite as cool air blowing off the sea can make hot land temperatures more bearable. However, these useful impacts lessen as the oceans heat, and warm waters also have less ability to absorb carbon dioxide, which means there will be more of the greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Warming oceans also contribute to ice melting, which causes sea level rise. Sea surface temperature measurements made from ships go back more than 150 years and are some of the longest instrumental records available for understanding the climate. For the past 40 years, there have also been measurements available from satellites and buoys. From this data, scientists have found that over the full period of the records, global mean sea surface temperature has increased by close to 0.9C, and that the increase over the past four decades is about 0.6C. The latest five-year average is about 0.2C above the average between 1991 and 2020. Some of the fastest warming areas are parts of the Arctic Ocean, the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea and parts of the extra-tropical Pacific. Several marine heatwaves have occurred around the world this year, including in the UK and Ireland earlier this summer. Last week, waters off Florida had unprecedented temperatures of 38C. Marine heatwaves are becoming more numerous, a 2019 study found, with the number of heatwave days having tripled in the past couple of years studied. The number of heatwave days rose by more than 50 in the 30 years to 2016, compared with 1925-54. Scientists said at the time the heat destroyed swathes of sealife like wildfires take out huge areas of forest. The damage caused in these hotspots is also harmful to humanity, which relies on the oceans for oxygen, food, storm protection and the removal of climate-heating carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

        "title": "President urges for sustainable, environmentally conscious practices in SL architecture",
        "date": "August 5, 2023 07:42 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has emphasised that integrating sustainable and environmentally conscious practices into Sri Lankas architectural designs will be instrumental in achieving the nations climate goals ahead of the set timeline. The Head of State made these remarks at an international conference on Architecture, which was organized by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Chapter in Sri Lanka, in collaboration with the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and the Italian Embassy of Sri Lanka, on the theme: Architecture: A Lasting Impact, held this morning (05) at Cinnamon Grand, Colombo. Accordingly, President Wickremesinghe emphasised that Sri Lanka has demonstrated a strong commitment to addressing climate change goals. Going forward, Sri Lankan architects will play a pivotal role in this endeavor, the Presidents media Division (PMD) reported. He noted that they will need to integrate climate change criteria into their designs, ensuring that the built environment aligns with sustainable and environmentally responsible practices, adding that together, we a resilient and environmentally friendly future can built for Sri Lanka, contributing to global efforts to combat climate change and protect the planet for generations to come. The President further mentioned prominent examples of significant architectural achievements such as the grand dagabas, including Ruwanwelisaya, Abhayagiri, and Jetavanaramaya, as well as iconic structures like Sigiriya, which stands as a prime example of exceptional architecture recognized worldwide. These architectural marvels are further exemplified by the structures found in Polonnaruwa. Notably, even during a period of decline, architectural endeavours persevered, evidenced by the expansion of the Dalada Maligawa featuring its octagonal design, and the construction of the Kandy Lake under the reign of the last king. President Wickremesinghe further stressed that throughout history, Sri Lanka has showcased its architectural prowess, evident in remarkable structures like the Trinity College Chapel, Kelaniya Vihara, Lake House building, Peradeniya University, Independence Square, and the Art Gallery, among others. The iconic Parliament building designed by Jeffrey Bawa has added to this rich architectural heritage. The President emphasized that if remarkable architectural feats were accomplished 2,000 or 1,000 years ago, there is no reason why the same level of excellence cannot be achieved in the present and future. The responsibility to create a lasting impact through architecture was entrusted to the Architects. The vision to transform Colombo into a beautiful city is already in motion, with plans provided by Surbana Jurong. Similar plans have been prepared for Trincomalee, aiming to enhance the development in that region as well. Additionally, Surbana Jurong is actively involved in creating a tourist zone from Verugal Aru to Batticaloa and Arugam Bay areas, contributing to the growth of the tourism industry. The focus on expanding the tourist industry is expected to create opportunities for non-government universities in Sri Lanka. The recent enactment of the new act, allowing provincial councils to establish universities, marks the beginning of this endeavour. There is a growing need for skilled professionals, including engineers, architects, IT specialists, and others, with the demand estimated to be at least 10,000 engineers alone. To address these requirements, discussions are underway with Japan, which has shown a willingness to assist in the past. Despite some challenges posed by the recent crisis, the commitment to progressing these plans remains strong, with the hope of securing the necessary support to meet the countrys developmental needs. Envisioning the future, the potential for architects to participate in the development of the Port City holds significant promise. A notable portion of the Port City land is under government ownership and is slated for diverse utilization. The involvement of the private sector in this initiative offers an added avenue to harness architectural expertise. This exploration requires collaborative dialogues involving relevant chambers and stakeholders. These emerging opportunities symbolize valuable prospects for Sri Lanka. Seizing these chances has the potential to establish a notable standing for the nation. Its imperative to acknowledge that as Indias progress persists, architectural possibilities might also arise there. Those with established recognition could potentially tap into this market, mirroring the engagement of architects in Africa for house design. Effectively orchestrating these prospects is critical for architects personal growth and the broader advancement of the discipline. By tapping into these potentials, Sri Lankan architects can substantially contribute to the countrys advancement while carving an illustrious identity for themselves on both regional and global platforms. The President acknowledged that his expertise lies primarily in the field of the economy and not architecture. As the discussion revolves around architecture and the lasting impression it creates, the President opted not to delve into the topic extensively. It was emphasized that ancient architects achieved the task of leaving a lasting impression through their work. Numerous architects have contributed to this legacy with their creations. However, the present challenge lies in not only preserving this rich heritage but also elevating it to meet global standards. This endeavour comes at a time when the construction industry is facing a downturn, a consequence of the recent crisis. Over the past two years, this sector has experienced significant setbacks, resulting in the unfortunate loss of numerous jobs and a noticeable reduction in available projects. However, amidst the challenges faced by the construction industry, the country now stands at a critical juncture. The last two years have witnessed a downturn in the construction sector, leading to job losses for many and a decline in available projects. Despite these difficulties, there is a pressing need to preserve and elevate this architectural legacy to international standards. The future lies in how the nation can continue its architectural journey and build upon its heritage to create structures that not only exemplify Sri Lankas identity but also meet global standards. Emphasizing innovation and creativity will be crucial in revitalizing the construction industry and rekindling its growth for a promising future. In the past, the economy predominantly revolved around concrete-based development, primarily directed at infrastructure like roads and irrigation projects. However, the resulting debt burden has contributed to the current crisis. This situation doesnt mandate a complete halt to construction; rather, economic restructuring calls for a shift in focus to other sectors. While revitalizing construction is desired, it may not reach previous levels. Furthermore, theres a need to encourage our construction companies to explore international opportunities. As part of the approach, the government is looking to involve private companies in building homes and structures. This is just the beginning. It will create more affordable housing for people with low and middle incomes. The government land thats worth more than the buildings can be used for this purpose and to relocate people from there and give the land to private companies to build affordable homes and apartments. This will also free up space in Colombo for other developments. Its like a cycle  more buildings, more possibilities. Imagine what could happen if they repurpose places like Welikada Prison or even the railway area. Some buildings on Mount Mary can be kept, but the rest can be used for new projects. Many areas could benefit from this. And the cost of land today makes it feasible. The Treasury is working on the details, so starting maybe next year or the year after, as the economy gets stronger, this could become a reality. The government is actively engaged in the promotion of tourism, with a target of increasing the number of tourists from 2.5 million to 5 million, and potentially up to 7.5 million. This endeavor entails diverse categories of accommodations, including various styles of bungalows. The restoration of historical structures to create smaller boutique hotels and the revitalization of larger hotels in various regions across the country represents a significant focus area. This ambitious goal involves doubling the existing capacity. Its important to note that the majority of this expansion will be realized through the construction of new buildings or the renovation of existing ones, thereby offering yet another avenue for the involvement of architects. A third strategic initiative involves the expansion of our existing investment promotion zones. The current discussions revolve around the establishment of expansive zones spanning thousands of acres, which will be gradually opened up. This expansion is set to facilitate the construction of additional factory buildings to accommodate growing industries. With Sri Lankas increasing role as a logistical hub, there will also be a heightened demand for logistics buildings, which are relatively straightforward to design. These represent just a few of the concepts were considering. As the economy gains momentum, its likely that well witness an increase in the construction of skyscrapers, high-rise structures, and residential homes. However, strategic planning is crucial to determine the locations, methods, and integration with our evolving transportation system. This is the direction I envision for the future, and its where our dedicated efforts must be focused. The re-planning of Kandy Town to potentially extend its boundaries up to Teldeniya, along with considerations for incorporating Peradeniya and potentially Talatu Oya, are subjects currently under committee deliberation. The committee will be responsible for making informed decisions regarding these proposals. Notably, the extension of the new town and bridge to Peradeniya is viewed as a significant priority. These opportunities signify important prospects for development. Similarly, Galle is engaged in evaluating the enhancement of its urban landscape, particularly the sea frontage. Additionally, it is likely that other regions, such as Nuwara Eliya town, will also require reimagining and redesigning in new locations. This presents a significant task. The pertinent question is whether we are prepared to embrace this challenge, which we must undertake. Collaboration with international counterparts will also be essential for successful execution. The impending tasks are undoubtedly of substantial magnitude. However, there is another crucial aspect that warrants attention. Sri Lanka remains steadfast in its commitment to climate change objectives. Notably, upon assuming leadership, adjustments were made to hasten the timeline from 2060 to 2050 for achieving climate change targets. Recent discussions at a UN session, prompted by the concerning fires in Europe, have spurred a re-evaluation of this timeline. There is a contemplation of expediting these efforts even before 2050. This endeavors feasibility rests, in part, upon available resources. Consequently, architects now face the imperative of aligning their designs with climate change criteria, marking a significant shift in their role and responsibilities. Reflecting on the past, Jeffrey Bawas remarkable work, such as the Kandalama project, highlights a growing trend of impressive designs in various scales. Sri Lankan architects are excelling in creating climate-responsive buildings, outperforming their counterparts elsewhere. Future laws and regulations will demand climate-adaptive constructions. An innovative concept emerges: establishing the International Climate Change University, comparable in size to Peradeniya University, within the former Kotmale Skanska camp. This presents significant opportunities. Presently, architects have a mission: leaving a lasting impact, reminiscent of historical achievements. The ability to achieve greatness in the past prompts a pertinent question: Why not now and in the future? This call is directed towards those pioneering architectural progress. The blueprint is set, and the drive to establish an enduring legacy rests with the architects of tomorrow. Douglas E. Sonnek, Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Colombo, Lisa Whanstall, the Acting British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Representatives from the Italian Embassy in Colombo, and nearly 350 people, including architects from Sri Lanka and South and Southeast Asia, attended the event. - PMD",

In his letter, Seneviratne explained that CEBs income reduced by roughly Rs. 33 billion for the year 2023, as a result of the recent tariff revision approved by PUCSL. Apart from this, he also stated that the outstanding amount due to be paid for the generation of renewable energy currently stands at a total of Rs. 29.7 billion. Meanwhile, Seneviratne further noted that while 4,500 gigawatts of hydropower was expected to be obtained this year, only 1,738 gigawatts have been obtained owing to the extreme dry weather conditions, further worsening the CEBs situation. Despite their reasonings, however, the PUCSL rejected the request in question, in writing, citing that as per an investigation conducted by the commission, the existing tariffs remain sufficient.",

The raid took place at a warehouse in the Hendala area in Wattala, while the stock of food items, including rice and canned fish, is valued at an estimate of over Rs. 500 million. This is believed to be the largest raid conducted by the CAA. Ada Deranas Ukussa visited the warehouse in question with officers from the Emergency Raid Unit of the CAA, upon receiving information about an attempt to release stocks of food, including 80,000 tins of canned food including mushrooms and fish, deemed unfit for human consumption, into the market. Upon inspection, the said tins were found inside the warehouse along with stocks of expired Basmati rice which had been imported, and were being prepared to be sold in the market after the respective labels had been changed. Stocks of dhal, extra virgin coconut oil, coriander and wheat flour were also amongst the rations found, Ada Derana learned. The warehouse reportedly belongs to the owner of a shop located down Fourth Cross Street in Colombo. Accordingly, samples were gathered from all the rations and food items which were stocked at the warehouse by CAA officers, and measures were taken to send the said samples to the analyst.",

Officials from Taliban-ruled Ministry of Education told principals of schools and short-term training classes in Ghazni province that any girl over 10 years of age is not allowed to study in primary schools, BBC Persian reported. A student in sixth grade- for which the Taliban had permitted education last year- said that girls who are over 10 years old were not allowed to enter the school. In some provinces, the local authorities of the Ministry for Preaching and Guidance separated girls based on age, the report claimed, adding that officials asked the principals of the girls school to send the female students above the third grade home. Talibans history of banning women education Following the exit of US and NATO-led regime in Afghanistan, Taliban in September 2021 banned girls from secondary education, ordering high schools to be reopened for boys only. Last December, it banned college and university-going women and imposed an indefinite ban on university education for thousands. Last month, the UN criticised Taliban for further increasing restrictions on women and girls in Afghanistan in recent months, including on education and employment. The regime has barred women from most areas of public life and work. This includes banning girls from going to school beyond the sixth grade and prohibiting Afghan women from working at local and non-governmental organisations. The ban was also extended to employees of the United Nations in April. Source - Hindustan Times -Agencies",

Cook said in a quarterly earnings call Thursday that Apple TV had beaten its subscriber targets over the three months ending July 1. He attributed some of that success to an uptick in interest after Messi signed for Inter Miami CF last month, bringing his star power to the comparatively minor US domestic game. We are excited about our MLS partnership, and were thrilled to see Messi suiting up with Inter Miami, the tech giants CEO told analysts. Its clearly in the early days, but we are beating our expectation in terms of subscribers, and the fact that Messi went to Inter Miami helped us out there a bit  and so were very excited about it, Cook added. Apple kicked off a 10-year partnership with the top US soccer league in February, launching a Season Pass that cost subscribers 13 a month and non-subscribers 15 a month. In June, Messi signaled he would join Inter Miami upon the expiry of his deal with Paris Saint-Germain, with the signing officially announced the following month. The World Cup winner has enjoyed a sensational start to life stateside, scoring five goals in his first three games for his new club. The Florida-based team will pay Messi 150 million over the next two-and-a-half years, per Sportico, including a regular salary, signing bonus, and equity in the team. The Athletic reported in June that Messi had also inked revenue-sharing agreements with both Apple TV and Adidas, which is one of MLSs largest corporate sponsors.

Gunawardena emphasized that necessary measures will be taken to prepare the relevant development plan aiming at various sectors including agriculture, livestock and fisheries. He urged all the communities as well as public servants to extend fullest cooperation for speedy implementation of the development plan. Speaking at the Batticaloa district program of the National Integration Participatory Development Program  Aluth Gamak  Aluth Ratak, the Prime Minister further mentioned that appropriate measures will be sought in order to solve the issues that have arisen in the agricultural sector and that the government has paid special attention to providing all the necessary facilities for that purpose. The Prime Minister said in his speech; I hope that the GA in this development plan, which has to be prepared by the development committee, that a clear development plan frame work is established on which we can work on in next two years. It is also important issue that we have embarked this programme. A special priority has been given to food security around the country. All of us know that in last year there was not only a food security warning within Sri Lanka there was a warning on food security internationally too. The Government was able to relax some of the obstacles that caused impediment for the farmers to engage in better production. I feel you would agree with all data statistics which shows that farmers were able to earn income through our harvest over an unprecedented level over the last two years which gave the country further confidence. Initially I would like to thank the farmers of Batticaloa because amidst all the problems they were able to produce a very high harvest. It is an important factor. It also gives confidence to our country internationally. Most of our friendly countries and international organisations have commended this achievement. The GA will be supporting livestock and agricultural sector in Batticaloa. Farmers were able to achieve the targets that have been agreed upon. President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Government are confident that we would be able to reach self-sufficiency in most of the agricultural products. That is why we assemble to appeal all of you in the Government service to contribute in maximum for the production to reach these targets. This will not only bring rupees to farmers it will also save the dollars that will otherwise have to fall out. We have failed to bring better livelihood and conditions in these districts. So many issues have been raised in relation to the farmers. We will give due attention to these along with the officials. There are some areas which have to be solved by way of increased financial crisis. Present situation is better than that of the last year. In the next budget president plans that we could make an increased allocation to the districts in order to go through their development. Already insurances have been given by most of the donor countries where the work has been stopped due to the financial crisis will be restored. We look forward to resume from October these rural projects, district projects which were stopped. It will contribute further in a multiplier effect through financial services that wont be able to benefit from it and the people who are involved in those services and construction sectors. In addition to that whatever the complaints I would like to bring to your notice there are our ministries, my secretary, officials and two state ministers are always available for any other matter to be raised and to be contacted. We will do wherever we could to support these development activities in the district. Minister Nazir Ahmed, Governor Senthil Thonaaman, State Ministers Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan (Pillayan), Ashoka Priyantha, Janaka Wakkumbura, MPs Rasamanickam Shanakyam, Govinda Karunakaran, Yadamini Gunawardena, Presidentail Adviser Suren Batagoda, Public Administration Secretary Ranjith Ashoka, District Secretary Kalamathi Pathmaraja and District officials were present at the relevant meeting.",

        "date": "August 6, 2023 08:23 pm",
        "content": "The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) emphasizes that schools will be charged for the additional water usage exceeding the allotted unit quantity, due to the fact that the free supply of water hitherto provided to the schools has been misused. Commenting further on the matter, Deputy General Manager of the NWSDB Piyal Padmanatha said that he had recently received information regarding such schools misusing the free water supply. Water supply is provided to schools free of charge since 1988, according to a Cabinet decision. Recently, it was observed that the water supply provided to the schools for free is being used for activities which are not related with schools, he said. If one person in a school uses 20 liters of water per day, and the school is held 20 days a month, it will be 400 liters for one person per month. Accordingly, if there are 1,000 users, we will provide 400,000 liters of water to a school without any charges. The amount of allocated free water supply increases as the number of students, non-academic staff and teachers increase in a school. If the use of water goes beyond that amount, you will definitely have to pay for that amount, Mr. Padmanatha explained. Meanwhile, he also highlighted that it has been decided to issue an electronic water bill starting from January 2024 and as its initial step, e-bills are expected to be issued in 04 selected areas. Accordingly, the consumers in the districts of Polonnaruwa, Trincomalee, Colombo-South and Kandy-South will only receive their water bills in the form of an e-bill as well as a SMS. The general public can send their water bills account number and e-mail address to the contact number 071 939 9999 in a text message, in order to automatically register their mobile numbers and e-mail addresses with the NWSDB. Furthermore, the Deputy General Manager of the NWSDB claimed that they expect to issue the water bill only through SMS and in the form of an E-bill in Sri Lanka starting from January 01, 2024.",

In order to make that effort successful, the Cabinet approved the implementation of the strategic program presented by the Ministry of Environment as the proponent of establishing the Climate Justice Forum. The Major activities to be carried out by the Ministry for this year include the formulation of a national climatic change policy, formulation of a national mineral policy, formulation of a national cooling policy for Sri Lanka, formulation of a Sri Lanka Road map for net zero Carbon by 2025, prohibition of four (04) environmentally harmful single-use plastic products and the establishment of climate cells to facilitate implementation of Provincial Adaptation Plan. Under waste management, we have introduced new rules for plastic use and recycling. The Central Environment Authority (CEA) has already incorporated the provisions of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and polluter pays the principal to National Environment Act amendment. Two pilot projects have already been implemented to practice EPR voluntarily.",

        "date": "August 6, 2023 09:56 pm",
        "content": "Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi stated that his country is willing to share its scientific and technical skills with Sri Lanka. President Raisi praised the two nations cordial and expanding relations during a meeting with Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry on Sunday in Tehran. Speaking of Irans remarkable progress in the fields of technology and science despite Western sanctions, Raisi expressed that Iran was prepared to share its capabilities with friendly nations, such as Sri Lanka. He emphasized Sri Lankas immense development potential, adding that global states may flourish and expand without colonial and self-interested foreign interference. Sri Lankas Foreign Minister lauded Iran for making significant progress in several domains despite international sanctions, touching on the constructive activities of Iranian companies in the country, and further pointing out that Colombo is excited to work on the promotion of financial, technological, and medical cooperation with Tehran. Sabry called his country the entrance to East Asia in a meeting with his Iranian counterpart on Saturday, stating, I invite Iranian companies to pay attention to Sri Lanka, explaining that Asia will account for two-thirds of future growth. Sabry also encouraged Iranian enterprises to invest in the country. In July, a report published by writer Giancarlo Elia Valori for Modern Diplomacy detailed the means by which Iran has thrived despite sanctions through various strategies and mechanisms of State intervention and non-intervention. The Iranian government has actively sought to ease the effects of sanctions on its knowledge-based industries through the implementation of various innovative financial mechanisms. For instance, in 2018, the National Innovation Fund underwent major changes, evolving from a quasi-banking institution to a financial regulator with the aim of facilitating the transfer of crucial funds to knowledge-based companies. Valori says that Iranian policies have evolved in three distinct stages: the first, spanning from 1990-2000, mainly focused on the development of higher education and an increase in the number of academic works; the second, from 2000-2010, focused on support for emerging technologies; and the present one is characterized by a shift towards science, technology, and innovation.

        "date": "August 7, 2023 07:48 am",
        "content": "MULTAN, Pakistan (AP)  Ten cars of a passenger train derailed in southern Pakistan on Sunday, killing 30 people and injuring more than 90 others, officials said. Some of the derailed cars on the Hazara Express train overturned in the crash near the town of Nawabshah, senior railway officer Mahmoodur Rehman Lakho said. The train was going from Karachi to Rawalpindi when the 10 cars went off the tracks near the Sarhari railway station. The derailed cars sprawled across or near the tracks in the flat, rural landscape. Local television showed rescue teams extracting women, children and elderly passengers from damaged and overturned cars. Some of the injured lay on the ground crying for help while locals gave out water and food. Senior police officer Abid Baloch said from the scene that the rescue operation was complete by early evening: Dozens of the injured were brought to safety and the last flipped car cleared. Expressing grief over the loss of life, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif prayed during a political gathering in Punjab for the souls of the departed and for the quick recovery of those injured. We all pray, may Allah grant a place in heaven to those who passed away and I wish quick recovery for the injured, he said. Lakho, who is in charge of railways in the accident area, said rescue crews took injured passengers to the Peoples Hospital in Nawabshah. Ihtesham Ali lost his family members and was looking for them in the chaotic situation. Seven members of my family and 22 from my neighborhood were missing and so far we found only four of them, rest are still missing. Mohsin Sayal, another senior railway officer, said train traffic was suspended on the main line as repair trains were dispatched to the scene. Sayal said alternative travel arrangements and medical care would be made available for the trains passengers. All trains in both directions were held at the nearest stations till the tracks could be cleared, while all departures were delayed. Passengers at Karachi station complained that they were waiting in hope as railway authorities kept changing departure times. Owais Iqbal, a Lahore bound passenger at Karachi railway station said: Our train was to depart at 5 p.m. Now we have been told that it will leave at 8 p.m. It may even get later. We are waiting. We are suffering because of the poor railway system. Minister for Railways Khwaja Saad Rafiq said an investigation into the cause of the crash was underway. He said that military and paramilitary troops helped rescue workers to rescue the trapped passengers. The most seriously injured passengers were transported to distant hospitals in military helicopters for better treatment. Train crashes often happen on poorly maintained railways tracks in Pakistan, where colonial-era communications and signal systems havent been modernized and safety standards are poor.

Amaraweera has given these instructions to the Chairman of the Agrarian Insurance Board, W.M.M.B.

Commenting on the matter following the discussion, Amaraweera stated to the media that they expect to submit the report of the damage caused to rice cultivation due to the drought condition to the President and to provide them with the compensation through the Agrarian Insurance Board. Currently we can only provide a compensation of Rs. 100,000 per hectare. But in some areas the situation is different. So we have focused on increasing the amount.

        "date": "August 7, 2023 12:10 pm",
        "content": "Nearly half a billion children in South Asia are exposed to extreme high temperatures as life-threatening heat waves caused by the climate crisis become stronger and more frequent, according to the United Nations childrens agency. In a news release Monday, UNICEF said its analysis of 2020 data showed an estimated 460 million children in countries including Afghanistan, India and Pakistan were exposed to temperatures where 83 or more days in a year exceeded 35 degrees Celsius (95 Fahrenheit)  making South Asia the hardest-hit region for those under age 18. The analysis showed 76 of children in South Asia were exposed to extreme high temperature compared to 32 globally, UNICEF said. Countries in the region are not the hottest in the world right now but the heat here brings life-threatening risks for millions of vulnerable children, said Sanjay Wijesekera, UNICEF regional director for South Asia. We are particularly concerned about babies, toddlers, malnourished children and pregnant women as they are most vulnerable to heat strokes and other serious effects. Temperatures in some parts of India soared to 47 degrees Celsius (116 Fahrenheit) in June, killing at least 44 people and sickening hundreds with heat-related illnesses. Some cities in Pakistan also saw similarly high temperatures the same month, raising fears especially for laborers who spend hours toiling outdoors and for poor populations with little to no cooling options. In parts of the countrys southern Sindh province, about 1.8 million people were exposed to temperatures of 40 degrees Celsius (104 F) and higher, UNICEF said, giving rise to short and long-term health risks, including dehydration and organ failure. UNICEF warns the situation is exacerbated for children as they are unable to quickly adapt to such temperature change. The risks can be life threatening  from fainting and poor mental development to neurological dysfunction, seizures and cardiovascular diseases. Pregnant woman are particularly susceptible to heat and can experience preterm births and stillbirths, UNICEF said. Prolonged heat and weather extremes Experts say the climate crisis is only going to cause more frequent and longer heat waves in the future, testing the regions ability to adapt. India, the worlds most populous nation of 1.4 billion, often experiences heat waves during the summer months of May and June, but in recent years, they have arrived earlier and become more prolonged. In April 2022, India experienced a heat wave that saw temperatures in the capital New Delhi exceed 40 degrees Celsius for seven consecutive days. In some states, the heat closed schools, damaged crops and put pressure on energy supplies, as officials warned residents to remain indoors and keep hydrated. Experts have also warned the threat facing Afghanistan is particularly stark. Not only is there high potential for record extreme heat, the impacts are compounded by dire social and economic problems. At the same time, extreme weather has had a deadly impact in other parts of the region. Flooding caused by record monsoon rains and melting glaciers in Pakistan submerged a third of the country last year, killing nearly 1,600 people  more than a third of whom were children. While the water washed away homes and destroyed villages, water-related ailments began infecting children, giving rise to a new disaster in the nation of 230 million. In its report, UNICEF warned that ultimately children, adolescents and women are among those who pay the highest price for extreme weather events. Young children simply cannot handle the heat, Wijesekera said. Unless we act now, these children will continue to bear the brunt of more frequent and more severe heat waves in the coming years, for no fault of theirs. Source  CNN -Agencies",

        "content": "In a meeting between Governor of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) Mohammad-Reza Farzin and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka Ali Sabry in Tehran, the two sides stressed the need for the development of monetary and banking relations between the two countries as a prerequisite for the expansion of bilateral economic ties. In the meeting on Sunday, Farzin referred to the important role of the Asian Clearing Union (ACU) in the development of trade relations between the two countries, saying: The ACU is a very suitable platform for the development of trade and monetary relations between the two countries and this platform can also be used to settle payments. The CBI governor proposed the formation of a specialized banking and monetary working group between the central banks of the two countries, noting that, The formation of this working group can play an important role in speeding up and facilitating banking cooperation. Meanwhile, it can also be used to develop monetary and banking relations as well as cooperation and economic exchanges. Farzin announced CBIs approval of the agreements made between Sri Lanka and other economic institutions in Iran, adding that the central banks of the two countries should guide monetary platforms and exchange processes in order to develop economic relations. He pointed out that Iran has been able to establish stable trade relations with its business partners despite the U.S. sanctions without causing any problems for the other parties. Iran is now fully prepared to cooperate with Sri Lanka in order to expand monetary and trade relations within the ACU framework, the official asserted. Sabry, for his part, pointed to the long-standing and continuous relations between the two countries and announced his countrys readiness to increase the level of trade with Iran. The establishment of a bilateral banking committee between Iran and Sri Lanka to follow up on relevant issues and facilitate commercial affairs will definitely lead to the development of bilateral cooperation, he said. The Sri Lankan official went on to say that the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is following up on the measures within the ACU framework. He also appreciated Irans support to Sri Lanka in the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The ACU was established in 1974 as a payment arrangement through which participants settle payments for intra-regional transactions among the participating central banks on a net multilateral basis, according to ACUs official website. ACU currently has nine members including India, Iran, and Pakistan. Source: Tehran Times --Agencies",

        "date": "August 8, 2023 07:36 am",
        "content": "Monetary policy transmission to the real economy in Sri Lanka is still incomplete, the governor of the countrys central bank, Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, said at a LSEG FX Community Event on Monday (Aug 7). Weerasinghe said he would like to see private sector interest rates come down further and at a faster pace, adding that the domestic debt restructuring is the most important focus for the debt-laden country in the near-term. We would firstly like to see yields drop in line with policy rates and, from there, decline further. We are waiting to see this reaction from markets, he said. Given the downward inflation trajectory we see room to further loosen policy rates. Hit by a severe foreign exchange shortage last year, Sri Lankas economy crumpled, pushing the central bank to raise interest rates to record levels to counter rampant inflation and currency pressure. The country secured a US2.9 billion rescue package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in March. In the last two months Sri Lanka has slashed policy rates by 450 basis points, signalling a focus on growth after the crisis-hit economy contracted by 7.8 per cent last year. Sri Lanka is on track to post a stronger performance this year than the 3 per cent contraction projected by the IMF, Weerasinghe said. Sri Lanka has managed to do better than expected before and we are hopeful that Sri Lanka will once again perform better than the projections. Over the past five months Sri Lankas economy has stabilised with inflation dwindling to 6.3 per cent in July, from a high of 69 per cent last September, and on track to hit the central banks target band of 4 per cent - 6 per cent. Sri Lankas economic stability is also dependent on the upcoming budget, which is likely to be presented to parliament in November. Sri Lanka has to ensure that fiscal consolidation and other measures outlined in the IMF program are taken forward in a strong budget. That is very important for Sri Lankas recovery to be sustainable, Weerasinghe said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "August 8, 2023 01:32 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera has assured that an uninterrupted power of supply will be provided island-wide. Taking to Twitter, Wijesekera stated that the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) will ensure an uninterrupted supply of power island-wide, adding that the CEB has no plans for scheduled power cuts. CEB will procure the necessary supplementary power needed to maintain 24-hour uninterrupted supply of power, the minister said in this regard. Meanwhile, addressing a press briefing organized by the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) today, Wijesekera strongly advised the members of the public not to be swayed by the spread of false information propagated by specific political factions regarding the release of water for electricity generation. He emphasized that such allegations are deceptive and should be treated with skepticism. Minister Kanchana Wijesekara further commented: The Cabinet has made a decision to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply to all regions of the island and to maximize the use of water from the Samanala Wewa Reservoir for electricity generation. As part of this effort, the Electricity Board has already initiated the release of 3.5 million cubic meters of water from the Samanala Wewa Reservoir, starting from 3:00 am today (08), for the purpose of generating electricity. Additionally, there is a plan to release 2.5 million cubic meters of water from the 11th to the 15th of this month, specifically for electricity generation. However, due to the current water capacity situation, it is anticipated that electricity generation activities at the Samanala Wewa reservoir will need to be temporarily suspended by the 16th of this month. The government is taking measures to ensure adequate electricity supply and optimal utilization of available water resources for electricity generation during this period. The Cabinet has granted approval to expedite the completion of the Polpitiya and Hambantota transmission line system. This decision aims to enhance the efficiency of the electricity transmission network and enable the purchase of electricity as per demand. The management of the Samanala Wewa Reservoir, which plays a crucial role in electricity generation, falls under the purview of the Electricity Board. However, it is important to note that the responsibility for releasing water required for power generation in all other reservoirs lies with the Irrigation Department and the Water Management Committee. Through proper management of the water capacity in the Samanala Wewa Reservoir, electricity generation activities are being carried out according to the planned program implemented by the Electricity Board. As a result, it is projected that a stable supply of electricity can be provided until September 15 without encountering any issues. The government is taking proactive measures to ensure a consistent and reliable electricity supply to meet the needs of the public and various sectors in the country. Due to the release of additional water from the Samanala Reservoir, there is a possibility of power cuts in specific districts of the southern province, including Matara and Hambantota, as well as partially in the Galle and Ratnapura districts, for a certain period of time. To mitigate this situation and ensure a continuous electricity supply, the government has made arrangements to purchase essential electricity by the 16th of this month. The decision to release water from the Samanala Wewa Reservoir is aimed at addressing the immediate crisis and preventing further potential crises. The government is working diligently to manage the available water capacity efficiently to support all power plant systems and maintain a stable electricity supply. It is important to emphasize that the government has never taken any decision to cut electricity, and unnecessary fear should not be created among the public. Continuous electricity supply is crucial for the countrys well-being, including the tourism sector and industries. A stable electricity supply is essential for attracting tourists and ensuring the smooth functioning of various industries. The government is committed to resolving this situation and ensuring that the necessary measures are in place to meet the electricity demands of the affected areas. Some political groups have attempted to exploit the current crisis for their own political gains by socializing different opinions regarding the release of water from the Samanala Wewa reservoir. Their efforts to create animosity towards the government were thwarted due to the decisive actions taken by the government. The memories of the power crisis from a year ago still linger, where people faced hardships due to soaring fuel prices and difficulties in running factories. Daily life, including vital services like hospitals, was disrupted. In the past, bottle lamps may have sufficed, but modern needs cannot be met with such traditional methods. Considering the drought situation in the country and the lack of expected rainfall this year, the government understands the challenges posed by climate change in the future. To address this, the government has presented a plan for continuous electricity supply, and measures have been taken to provide a certain amount of water for agricultural needs as well. In light of the current circumstances, the government aims to secure the necessary electricity through purchases to ensure uninterrupted power supply for the next two years.

Accordingly, the move is being made in a bid to align with global sustainability goals, and as part of a comprehensive plan to modernize Sri Lankas public passenger transport service, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. To enhance the convenience and reliability of the public transport system, GPS tracking and E-Ticketing facilities will also be introduced, while passengers will benefit from accurate real-time information, and operators will have access to improved management systems. Further, a comprehensive national transport policy will be introduced to address long-standing challenges and issues within the public transport sector, paving the way for a more coordinated and efficient transportation network.

Meanwhile, Unit 3 of the power plant has remained inoperative since June 13 for scheduled major overhaul maintenance work. As a result, only one unit of the power plant is operating at the moment and it adds 300 megawatts of electricity to the national grid. Meanwhile, Minister of Power  Energy Kanchana Wijesekera, earlier today, said the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has assured an uninterrupted supply of electricity island-wide. Taking to Twitter, the lawmaker emphasized that the CEB has no plans for scheduled power cuts. Wijesekera said the CEB would procure the necessary supplementary power needed to maintain 22-hour uninterrupted supply of power. The ministers remarks came as a clarification after he told the parliament this morning that electricity needs to be purchased in order to ensure an uninterrupted supply from August 15 onwards as the operations at Samanalawewa hydroelectric power plant stand to be interrupted by August 16 owing to the move to release water from the water body to the Udawalawe reservoir. He stated that several areas including Matara, Galle, Ratnapura and Hambantota are likely to experience three-hour power cuts in the event the request for electricity purchase is not approved. Irrigation authorities commenced releasing water from the Samanalawewa reservoir to the Udawalawe reservoir for agricultural purposes in the early hours of the day. The Cabinet of Ministers on Monday (Aug 07) had green-lighted Wijesekeras proposal to release the maximum amount of water from Samanalawewa reservoir to Udawalawe reservoir required for agricultural purposes. According to State Minister of Power  Energy D.V. Chanaka, water is being released at a rate of 3.5 million cubic meters per day for three days.",

        "content": "The committee of experts appointed to investigate the recent incidents of drug allergies and their aftereffects has handed over its report to the Ministry of Health today (Aug. 08). The committee, chaired by the Director of the Medical Research Institute (MRI) Dr. Dedunu Dias, consisted of six members including Prof. Chandima Jeewandara, Head of the Allergy Immunology and Cell Biology Unit of Sri Jayewardenepura University. Taking to Twitter, Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said the full report would not be disclosed due to doctor-patient confidentiality. Accordingly, only the conclusion and recommendations have been made public. The report suggests that out of the six cases analyzed in detail, five have met the criteria for anaphylaxis, which is a life-threatening allergic reaction that happens very quickly. Among the five patients who had anaphylaxis, the causality assessment using WHO-UMC causality assessment criteria categorized four adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as probable due to the suspected drug. The report has recommended the following: 1. Revisiting and establishing national and institutional guidelines protocols on anaphylaxis management emergency management 2. Re-emphasizing the practice of recognize early and treat immediately with adrenalin in anaphylaxis. Authorizing the registered nursing officers of institutions to use 1:1000 adrenalin in the IM route in an emergency without the directions of medical officers 3. Developing a mandatory continuous professional development mechanism or training programme for medical officers and nursing officers on emergency management of anaphylaxis 4. Instituting a compulsory mechanism to conduct institutional clinical audits for all life-threatening adverse incidents reported 5. Revising the TOR of DTCs to include the development of institutional drug management policies (ex: Institutional Antibiotic policy, ADR audit policy, etc.) and to introduce institutional mechanisms to minimize medication errors 6. Establishing networks or pathways for anaphylaxis survivors for subsequent allergy reviews 7. Establishing a mechanism to educate Year 10  11 students at schools from across the country on allergies and the safe use of medicinesantibiotics. Establishing a similar mechanism to educate media personnel and the public 8. Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of ADRs reporting and response system by introduction of real-time data-sharing mobile applications. Allowing the public to report ADRs to the NMRA. 9. Taking speedy remedial actions on procedural andor financial issues that may hinder the adequate supply of safe and effective drugs of acceptable quality to healthcare institutions. 10. Emphasizing strict maintenance of temperature control during transportation of pharmaceuticals. 11. Stringent evaluation of the quality of medicines during registration and post-marketing quality testing of random samples is recommended to improve the quality of pharmaceuticals in the country. 12. Appropriate and expedited reporting on quality failures is needed. Minister Keheliya said he is awaiting the results of the quality test of the drug in question after a thorough, independent examination by the National Drug Quality Control Laboratory (NDQL). He said this is the reason he had discussed with President Ranil Wickremesinghe to set up a Benchmark 4 laboratory funded by the World Health Organization (WHO) to qualitatively expedite such queries. Deep concerns were raised in the country about the alleged substandard drug imports after an allergic reaction caused by an antibiotic called Ceftriaxone resulted in the death of a 21-year-old girl who was receiving treatment at the Peradeniya Teaching Hospital in July for indigestion issues. She had shown signs of an allergic reaction after being administered the second vial of Ceftriaxone which contained a dose of 1mg. It was reported that the young woman had not shown any signs of an allergic reaction after the first dose was administered. Days later, two other patients who were under medical care at the Kandy National Hospital too had developed allergic reactions to the antibiotic, after which the batch of the antibiotic used in the Kandy National Hospital and Peradeniya Teaching Hospital was withheld. On July 17, Health Minister Rambukwella appointed the seven-member committee chaired by Dr. Dedunu Dias.",

During his stay, Tendulkar paid a visit to UNICEF programmes in the Sabaragamuwa Province and met with children and parents impacted by the COVID-pandemic and the 2022 economic crisis. Tendulkar recalled warm memories associated with Sri Lanka during his earlier visits, both as a cricketer and as part of his engagements with UNICEF in 2015. He lauded the efforts of all government and non-government organisations in their efforts towards bringing positive change despite challenging environments. During the field mission, Tendulkar visited a preschool, supported by UNICEFs ongoing mid-day school meal programme, and helped serve nutrient-rich food to children. Since August 2022, UNICEFs midday meal programme has been providing nutritious meals to 50,000 preschool children in nearly 1,400 schools across the country. The meal programme has also helped boost preschool attendance. Children require a nutrient-rich diet and quality education to reach their full potential. By investing in their education and nutrition, we are not only investing in their future but also every countrys future, said Tendulkar. At another school Tendulkar visited, he observed teaching and learning activities for grade 3 children where many students shared their desire to stay in school and follow their dreams. Sachin then joined the senior schoolgirls and boys on the pitch for a game of cricket. The children I spoke with, are showing great tenacity, and their hope for a better future remains strong. We need to continue supporting them so they keep achieving their goals, added Sachin. Tendulkar also visited families living in plantations, to understand their lives better. As part of the support for economic recovery, UNICEF provided cash transfers to more than 110,000 families with children up to two years of age to buy nutritious foods and other vital supplies needed for their children. Tendulkar also took time to speak to a group of young people from Sri Lanka, in a close Cricket Catch-Ups session during which he shared his experiences growing up, in overcoming obstacles, remaining resilient and focused in pursuing his goal. These young people are a part of the UNICEF-supported Childrens Club network of the Department of Probation and Child Care Services. Sachin Tendulkar was appointed as the first UNICEF Regional Goodwill Ambassador for South Asia in 2013. Since then, he has been playing a pivotal role in improving the lives of children in South Asia.",

The World Scout Jamboree, which commenced on August 02 at a makeshift campsite in Saemangeum on the countrys west coast, had planned to feature outdoor activities, cultural performances, sustainability workshops and other events for the participants who are most teenagers. However, the much-anticipated jamboree was hit by a string of troubles, initially a heatwave that led to mass sunstroke casualties with hundreds of teenagers ending up at the on-site hospital, and then complaints about the conditions in the camp, followed by an approaching typhoon. The World Organization of the Scout Movement on Monday (Aug. 07) announced an emergency evacuation plan citing the incoming Typhoon Khanun which is expected to cause 150mm of heavy rainfall, foreign media reported. By Tuesday, more than 1,000 buses carrying approximately 37,000 scouts had begun leaving the jamboree campsite, escorted by 237 police patrol vehicles and four police helicopters. The participants are placed in 128 accommodation locations across the country. Most of the scouts will be accommodated in Seoul and the capitals metropolitan area, where officials have secured university dormitories, government and corporate training centers, and hotels.

        "date": "August 9, 2023 07:39 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, during a meeting with students from Girls High School Kandy on Tuesday (Aug. 08), has expressed his strong commitment to increasing womens representation in politics through reformative changes. He has also highlighted his dedication to achieving a significant level of womens participation in politics and emphasized the need for specific reforms to facilitate this objective, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). President Wickremesinghe made these remarks in response to a question raised by one of the visiting students from Girls High School Kandy, representing the Student Parliament. As part of their tour, over 100 female students have visited various governmental institutions, including the Sri Lankan Parliament, Colombos port city, the Presidents House, and the Presidential Secretariat. The students also had the opportunity to engage in a friendly meeting with the President at the main auditorium of the Presidential Secretariat. The PMD said President Wickremesinghe has provided the students with valuable insights into the history, structure, and pivotal role of the Presidential Secretariat as the primary decision-making institution in the countrys governance. The Head of State also emphasized the importance of providing students studying arts subjects with opportunities to explore other fields such as science and mathematics for higher education. President Wickremesinghe stated that he believes that such interdisciplinary learning will enable them to contribute effectively to the future development of Sri Lanka, with a vision towards becoming a developed nation by 2048. This visit by Girls High School Kandy students has marked the initial phase of a program initiated to open the Presidential Secretariat to school children, the PMD said. During their visit, the students had the chance to acquire new skills and gain valuable experiences.",

        "date": "August 9, 2023 09:55 am",
        "content": "While addressing parliament a short while ago, the President emphasized the necessity of implementing the 13th Amendment in a way that suits the nations growth and future. He also stressed that achieving this matter requires a consensus among all parliament members through comprehensive and open-minded deliberations, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. Meanwhile President Wickremesinghe, who advocated a departure from the traditional view of the opposition merely criticizing the government, urged a more inclusive approach that involves considering opposition viewpoints in decision-making, promoting a more balanced and collaborative political environment. In his special parliamentary address, he further emphasized the importance of acting confidently and responsibly. The President also highlighted that the nations development relies on the joint efforts of following a fresh direction, encouraging the adoption of this new approach. In addition, Wickremesinghe urged all members to avoid engaging in personal debates and instead focus on envisioning the nations future, while calling for sincere unity among parliamentarians to collaboratively make decisions that prioritize the countrys long-term interests. Speaking further, the President said that there are three categories of prisoners: remand prisoners, those on death row and those with other sentences, and the last two categories will be considered for Presidential Pardon. Based on the recommendations of the Minister of Justice, Presidential approval has been granted to release 11 prisoners from the category of those with other sentences, he added. Moreover, the President highlighted that around 90 to 92 of the land occupied by the Security Forces and the police in 2009, has been gradually released. This includes 22,919 acres, consisting of 817 acres of state-owned, and 22,101 acres of privately owned land, he said. The occupied land area by security forces and police is 3,754 acres, with 862 acres being state-owned and 2,892 acres being privately owned, he added. At the meantime, he stated that efforts are underway to accelerate the formation of the National Land Commission (NLC) and a National Land Policy. A preliminary NLC law has been created and is being reviewed for crafting a policy on State land usage, he said, adding that a Land Commission Policy Act is anticipated by September to provide direction for NLCs operations. During his address at the Parliament, the President also mentioned that the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) has initiated efforts to locate missing individuals, the PMD said. He expressed that measures are being taken to speed up the data entry process, with the goal of completing it within three months, while the issuance of the Certificate of Absence (COA) is also being fast-tracked.",

        "title": "Tory Lanez gets 10 years in prison for shooting Megan Thee Stallion",
        "date": "August 9, 2023 11:40 am",
        "content": "A judge sentenced rapper Tory Lanez to 10 years in prison Tuesday for shooting and wounding hip-hop superstar Megan Thee Stallion in the feet, bringing a conclusion to a three-year legal and cultural saga that saw two careers, and lives, thrown into turmoil. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Herriford handed down the sentence to the 31-year-old Lanez, who was convicted in December of three felonies: assault with a semiautomatic firearm; having a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle and discharging a firearm with gross negligence. From the initial incident in the Hollywood Hills in July of 2020, to the marathon two-day sentencing hearing, the case created a firestorm in the hip-hop community, churning up issues including the reluctance of Black victims to speak to police, gender politics in hip-hop, online toxicity, protecting Black women and the ramifications of misogynoir, a particular brand of misogyny Black women experience. Herriford said it was difficult to reconcile the portrait Lanezs friends and family painted during the hearing of a kind, charitable person and good father to a 6-year-old son with the person who fired the gun at Megan. Sometimes good people do bad things, Herriford said. Actions have consequences, and there are no winners in this case. Megan testified during the trial that Lanez fired the gun at the back of her feet and shouted for her to dance as she walked away from an SUV in which they had been riding, after leaving a pool party at Kylie Jenners home. She had to have surgery to remove bullet fragments. She revealed who had fired the gun only months later. Since I was viciously shot by the defendant, I have not experienced a single day of peace, Megan said in a statement read in court by a prosecutor on Monday. Slowly but surely, Im healing and coming back, but I will never be the same. Lanez asked Herriford for mercy just before the judge delivered his sentence, requesting either probation or a minimal prison sentence. If I could turn back the series of events that night and change them, I would, Lanez continued. The victim was my friend. The victim is someone I still care for to this day. He added, Everything I did wrong that night, I take full responsibility for. Lanez appeared stunned while the sentence was read, but had no audible reaction. His family and fans in the courtroom also remained quiet after the sentence. The rapper was given about 10 months of credit for time hes served, most of it spent in jail since his conviction in December. Were extremely disappointed, Lanezs lead attorney Jose Baez said outside the courthouse. I have seen vehicular homicide and other cases where theres death, and the defendant still gets less than 10 years. Baez called the sentence really just another example of someone being punished for their celebrity status and someone being utilized to set an example. And hes not an example. Hes a human being. Lanezs lawyers plan to appeal the verdict, and to attempt to have him released on bail while they do. Megan, whose legal name is Megan Pete, was repeatedly praised by prosecutors for her courage in testifying during the case and enduring online campaigns of hatred directed at her. I hope that Miss Petes bravery gives hope to those who feel helpless, said Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón of Megan at a news conference after the sentencing. Prosecutors had sought a 13-year prison sentence. Legally, Lanez had been eligible for up to 22. During Mondays session, Lanezs father, Sonstar Peterson, choked back tears as he talked about how the rappers mother died when he was 11, just days after she first showed symptoms of the rare blood disorder that would lead to her death. I dont think anybody ever gets over that, he said of their youngest child, whose legal name is Daystar Peterson. But his music became his outlet. Lanez began releasing mixtapes in 2009 and saw a steady rise in popularity, moving on to major-label albums. His last two reached the top 10 on Billboards charts. Megan Thee Stallion, now 28, was already a major rising star at the time of the shooting, and her prominence has surged since. She won a Grammy for best new artist in 2021, and she had No. 1 singles with Savage, featuring Beyoncé, and as a guest on Cardi Bs WAP. The elder Peterson, who is a Christian minister, was one of several people who gave statements on Lanezs character and charitable giving  as did the mother of Lanezs son. Dozens more wrote letters to Herriford, including rapper Iggy Azalea, who asked the judge to hand down a sentence that was transformative, not life-destroying. Herriford said Lanezs 6-year-old also sent in a handwritten letter, but the judge did not describe it further. Lanezs family and supporters have packed the courtroom; during the trial, they contended his prosecution was unjustly brought on by Megan and powerful figures in music. After the verdict was read in December, Lanezs father denounced the wicked system that led to his sons conviction; on Monday, Sonstar Peterson apologized to Herriford for the outburst. The judge had handed several small victories to each side during the sentencing hearing. He found that Megan, who was in an isolated area wearing only a bathing suit with no shoes, was an especially vulnerable victim when she was shot, but that Lanez was not overly cruel or callous in firing at her. The judge found that Lanez posed no threat to public safety and that his lack of a criminal record should work in his favor. Lanezs lawyers argued that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder from his mothers death and other childhood difficulties. That stress led to serious alcohol abuse as an adult, they said. But the judge agreed with prosecutors that those mental illnesses should not be considered in the sentencing, and in the end gave prosecutors most of what they wanted. Under California law, Lanez was only allowed probation in the case if the judge found unusual circumstances. The judge found that the case was only unusual because of the two famous people involved, which he said was not a factor. He should not be treated severely because hes a celebrity, Hereford said, nor should he be treated with leniency because hes a celebrity. Source  The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "content": "Amid concerns in India about Chinese activities in Sri Lanka, the Lankan high commissioner, Milinda Moragoda, said that the recent visit by President Ranil Wickremesinghe had consolidated the trust-building process between the 2 countries and that the strategically located island nation in the Indian Ocean saw Indias security as Sri Lankas own security. PM Narendra Modi had during the visit by Wickremesinghe underlined the need for the 2 countries to keep each others safety and sensitivities in mind while working together. There were discussions on geopolitical and strategic issues during the visit. Indias security is our security. We have civilisational links. We have the same blood. There has to be more communication and trust-building and the visit has consolidated this process, Moragoda told TOI, while discussing the significance of what was Wickremesinghes first visit to India as the president of Sri Lanka. The visit last month was also the first by the Lankan president since a Chinese spy vessel, much to Indias consternation, was allowed to dock at the Hambantota port last year. The president had assured India that Sri Lanka will remain mindful of Indias security concerns in the maritime domain, especially in relation to Chinas presence in his country. The visit saw Wickremesinghe thanking Modi for assistance worth  4 billion dollars India provided to the debt-ridden country to stabilise its economy and also for support in debt restructuring efforts. There was focus on finding a new growth strategy at a time the global environment remains challenging. We are looking at how we can benefit from India through integration of the 2 economies, better connectivity and by attracting more investments from India, said Moragoda, adding that Sri Lanka can be a gateway to the region the way the Netherlands is to Europe. The visit had India and Sri Lanka signing several agreements and unveiling a bilateral vision document focused on opening up new possibilities in trade and economic cooperation. Modi had also strongly raised the Tamil issue with Wickremesinghe, seeking the implementation of the 13th Amendment for devolution of power and also early provincial elections. He had said India wanted Sri Lanka to ensure a life of dignity for the Tamil community. Asked about Modis remarks, Moragoda said Sri Lankas commitment to the 13th Amendment wasnt in doubt but that this issue could only be addressed through Parliament. Sri Lanka is keen on reconciliation and the president is talking to all stakeholders. Its a deeply polarised society and consensus has to be built in Parliament. The president has clearly explained how he wants to do it, including through the establishment of a truth commission, said the high commissioner. During his visit, Wickremesinghe had shared with Modi his comprehensive proposal for furthering reconciliation and power sharing through devolution. Source - Times of India -Agencies",

        "date": "August 9, 2023 04:08 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has urged for all Sri Lankans to unite to solve the current issues concerning power devolution and provincial councils. Delivering a special statement in Parliament this morning (09 August), the Head of State said. Lets collectively endeavour as a united nation to tackle this challenge. We must find solutions to our dilemmas within our own capabilities. External parties or foreign nations cannot solve our issues for us. Following the revision of laws pertaining to Provincial Councils and the implementation of new legislation, should the Parliament endorse the amending the Provincial Council Voting Act, which includes voting based on the District Proportional System and allows Members of Parliament the right to contest in Provincial Councils, with a minimum of 25 female representation, President Ranil Wickremesinghe noted that once discussions have been held and consensus reached regarding the proposed increase in the number of provincial councils, measures will be undertaken to conduct provincial council elections. The President made this declaration today (09) during a special statement in the Parliament, wherein he presented his suggestions and forthcoming actions concerning the 13th amendment of the Constitution and the delineation of powers. He confirmed that the establishment of a committee, headed by the Prime Minister, will be pursued to re-evaluate the powers assigned to the central government, the functions assigned to provincial councils, and the shared responsibilities stipulated in the constitution. The resulting amendments will be proposed, garnering the support of all parliamentary factions. Furthermore, President Ranil Wickremesinghe highlighted the intent to establish an advisory council to offer guidance to provincial governors until the operationalization of the provincial councils. Noting the entrenched role of Provincial Councils within the governance structure and political landscape of the country, the President emphasized the opportunity to effect a substantial transformation in constructing an effective, transparent, and corruption-free Provincial Council system that commands public trust and addresses citizen concerns. President Ranil Wickremesinghe acknowledged the challenges in reaching consensus, particularly with sensitive matters like police powers during the devolution of authority to Provincial Councils under the 13th Amendment. He underscored the importance of unity in executing these initiatives. Following is the full speech delivered by President Ranil Wickremesinghe; The provincial council system was introduced in 1987 through the 13th Amendment to the constitution. This system has been operational in our country for 36 years. Nevertheless, numerous issues surround the implementation of the 13th Amendment, as well as the functioning of provincial councils. If our nation is to progress, these problems must be addressed. The 13th Amendment needs to be implemented in a manner that aligns with our countrys development and future. This can only be achieved if all parliament members come to a consensus after thorough and open-minded discussions. To facilitate this, we recently organized an all-party conference, which saw participation from representatives of various political parties, for which I am appreciative. However, during the conference, we couldnt arrive at a comprehensive agreement on power devolution. Divergent perspectives on a specific national decentralization program were evident. It became apparent that certain political parties were hesitant to share their ideas, possibly due to past negative experiences from prior all-party conferences. Its time to change this situation. We should shift away from the convention of viewing the oppositions role solely as criticizing the governments actions. Lets also abstain from making decisions without considering opposition viewpoints. We must act with assurance and accountability. Our countrys progress hinges on collective advancement along a new path. Lets work towards establishing this new approach. I want to reiterate a point I consistently emphasize: instead of dwelling on the past, lets focus on the future. Yes, weve encountered challenges in the past, but lets refrain from debating them and instead concentrate on envisioning the countrys future. With genuine intentions, lets unite and make joint decisions that consider the nations future. Have we achieved success in implementing the provincial councils through the 13th Amendment over the past 36 years? Or has it been a failure? What factors have contributed to either outcome? Lets engage in a discussion on this matter. Lets delve deeper, examine new global trends, and explore cases worldwide. In our region, notable examples from countries such as India and China, as well as in the Western world including the United States of America and Canada, reveal instances of successful power devolution. Even smaller countries like the United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Japan have adopted devolution. For instance, lets consider China, where ethnic minorities account for less than 9 percent of the population. Despite this, China has granted autonomous powers to these minorities through various administrative entities such as zones, county (korale), and cities. We must explore cases from different nations where national policies have effectively decentralized power. By learning from these experiences, we can identify a suitable system for our own country. Our annual expenditure on provincial councils amounts to around Rs. 550 billion. Have these councils justified this investment? Has this substantial funding truly benefited the populace? This is a crucial aspect that deserves attention. We spend LKR 22,000 for each person every year. We are spending LKR 22,000 that could be spent on our students for provincial councils. That is LKR 88,000 that could be spent on a family of four. Are we getting benefits from it? The division of power and authority between provincial councils, central government, and local governing bodies lacks clarity. Consequently, subjects overlap between provincial councils and the central government, resulting in duplication of efforts and delayed actions. Instead of resolving peoples issues, problems are escalating due to these inefficiencies. Some individuals in our nation label provincial councils as white elephants due to these challenges. Yet, amid these limitations, provincial councils have significantly influenced Sri Lankas political trajectory. They have nurtured skilled political leaders and served as stepping stones to executive and parliamentary roles. Throughout history, numerous individuals who embarked on their political journey as provincial council members ascended to positions of power like the executive presidency, premiership, cabinet membership, and other significant roles. Many of the Ministers currently seated in this House have traversed a path from provincial council members to Chief Ministers and beyond. During the inception of provincial councils, certain political parties expressed opposition. Some parties chose democratic protests, while others resorted to undemocratic means to voice their dissent. Tragically, this period witnessed loss of lives and destruction of national assets. Nonetheless, those days belong to the past. Notably, none of the parliamentary political parties advocate for the abolition of provincial councils. Representatives from all these parties have engaged with and been part of provincial councils. An additional aspect demands our attention here. The devolution of power within provincial councils is governed by the 13th Constitutional Amendment, which holds the status of the highest law of our nation. We cannot afford to disregard it. Both the executive and the legislature are obligated to execute its provisions. Today, I present my proposals and forthcoming actions concerning the 13th Amendment and the devolution of powers to this esteemed House. I urge a thorough examination of these suggestions. I invite you to contribute your ideas as well. Taking all these viewpoints into careful consideration, the responsibility of arriving at the final decision regarding the role and future of provincial councils rests solely with this honourable council. What characterizes modern democracies? The establishment of decentralized governance as opposed to devolution. Devolution of power serves to bring political, economic, social, and cultural matters closer to the people. This goal is pursued using diverse methods in different nations across the globe. Decentralization is recognized as a pathway to achieving a form of direct democracy. While no governmental system can fully transition to a direct democracy where all citizens gather to make decisions, its feasible to construct an institutional framework that facilitates peoples participation and their expression of will in political, economic, and social processes. The provincial council system serves as one such framework that brings power to the people. Furthermore, weve recently initiated several other strategies to empower the populace. Weve bolstered sectoral committees and fostered youth involvement for this purpose. Concurrently, efforts are underway to establish public assemblies, aiming to involve citizens in grassroots governance. The Janasabha Secretariat has been launched, and once model assemblies are established, well advance the Assembly Act. In light of these advancements, I believe our focus should be on devising methods and strategies to further empower the people through provincial councils. By doing so, we can transform provincial councils into institutions that safeguard national unity. In recent years, numerous committees associated with the Parliament have produced several documents that thoroughly examine the subject of provincial councils and their prospective trajectory. Among these documents is the interim report released on September 21, 2017, by the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Council of Sri Lanka, under my leadership. Importantly, all parties represented within the Parliament endorsed the recommendations outlined in this interim report. The interim report offers recommendations concerning amendments to Articles 3, 4, and 5 of the Constitution. We now bring forward these proposed constitutional amendments for consideration by the Parliament. The report also outlines the following points for implementation: 1. Ensuring the participation of provincial councils in the formulation of national policies concerning matters within the provincial list. In formulating National Policy on matters contained in the Provincial List the Central Government shall adopt a participatory process with the Provincial Council; 2. No transfer of decentralized powers to the Central Government through the creation of national policies related to topics within the Provincial List, nor any impact on the executive and administrative powers under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Council. Formulation of National Policy on a Provincial List matter would not have the effect of the Centre taking over executive or administrative powers with regard to the implementation of the said devolved power; 3. The executive and administrative powers required to enact the decentralized subject will remain under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Councils. The Province will retain the executive or administrative powers (implementation powers) with regard to the said devolved power; I will present the above proposals to parliament as constitutional amendments so the House could take it forward for necessary action. In response to the interim report, several parties including Sri Lanka Freedom Party, Janatha Vimukti Peramuna, Tamil United Liberation Front, Jathika Hela Urumaya, United Opposition, All Ceylon Muslim Congress, All Ceylon Peoples Congress, Eelam Peoples Democratic Party, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, Tamil Progressive Party of Mr. Douglas Devananda, and Presidents Counsel Mr. Jayampathi Wickramaratne presented documents. This aspect should also be duly noted. Furthermore, attention should be directed towards the report from the committee established to examine the relationship between the Parliament and the Provincial Councils, as well as the report from the Sub-Committee on Centre Periphery Relations. Through these documents, the provincial council system is affirmed as an institutional framework that cannot be excluded from our governance system. Even parties like the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna and Jathika Hela Urumaya, which do not view provincial councils as a solution to ethnic conflicts or as units of decentralization, have acknowledged the need for specific amendments within the provincial council system and its unchanged aspects. This reinforces the notion that the provincial council has become an enduring component that cannot be excised from Sri Lankas governmental structure or political landscape. If we can achieve a consensus that garners everyones approval, well have the opportunity to safeguard our national identity, unite as a single nation, and decentralize the countrys power, making it more accessible to the people. Its important to note that provincial councils were established not exclusively in the Northern and Eastern provinces but across all nine provinces. National unity is upheld by steering provincial councils in the right direction. Simultaneously, it can be confirmed as a more efficient and service-oriented organizational system. It presents a chance to decentralize power, bringing governance closer to the general populace. Therefore, our primary aim should be to develop the provincial council system as an institution that aligns with public needs, caters to public requirements, and contributes to national development. To pave the way for this, I propose introducing several bills to the Parliament and implementing a series of new measures: Appointment of Divisional Secretaries Granting Authority to Provincial Councils for Education-related Services This involves exercising all powers related to school education listed in Schedule 3 of the Provincial Council List. Establishment of Provincial Boards for Vocational and Technical Training Services Empowerment of Provincial Councils to Establish Universities Authorization for Provincial Councils to Provide Grassroots Agricultural Innovation and Services Creation of Provincial Tourism Promotion Boards Amendment to the Industries Act to Increase the Limit For industries of national importance, the limit will be raised from Rs. 4 million to Rs. 250 million. If this Parliament agrees, were ready to elevate it to Rs. 500 million. Correction of Errors in Delegated Functions to Provincial Councils Establishment of District Development Councils in Accordance with the 13th Constitutional Amendment Develop a three-year development plan for each provincial council in alignment with central government national policies. Integrate central government development programs into this plan, customized to each jurisdiction. Execute this three-year plan via District Development Councils and entrust its implementation to Provincial Councils. Additionally, formulate a legal framework wherein Members of Parliament, Members of Provincial Councils, and Members of Local Government Bodies representing each district can collaborate effectively in this endeavour. We are currently in the process of establishing a committee, led by the Prime Minister, tasked with re-evaluating the list of powers held by the central government, the provincial council powers, and the concurrent list outlined in the constitution. The objective is to propose necessary amendments. We are actively seeking the support of all parties represented in the Parliament for this initiative. The Provincial Council Act No. 42 of 1987 lacks precise definitions regarding the responsibilities of provincial council ministers, their secretaries, and other officials. As a result, misunderstandings, issues, and confusion can arise. To address this, amendments should be made to the Provincial Council Act, specifying their powers. Following the revision of these laws concerning Provincial Councils and the enactment of new laws, subject to the Parliaments agreement, we are prepared to amend the Provincial Council Elections Act. Presently, three proposals have been submitted in this context: Adoption of the District Proportional System for Voting Allowing Members of Parliament to contest in provincial council elections Raising the representation of women to 25 or higher Efforts will be made to facilitate discussions, reach consensus, and proceed with the provincial council vote based on these proposals. Our primary focus centers on establishing an advisory council to guide provincial governors until the provincial councils are fully operational. As members of this Advisory Council, we recommend appointing the Chairman or Chief of the Provincial Supervisory Committee, District Development Committee Chairman, and Members of Parliament representing political parties within the province. Furthermore, we propose the establishment of a separate committee for legislative purposes. This committee would ensure that draft laws receive endorsement from the advisory committee before being enacted into law. This Advisory Council would be co-chaired by the Governor and a nominated Member of Parliament from the respective province. The governor would oversee executive matters, while the Member of Parliament would preside over legislative affairs. Currently, there are 45 functioning Provincial Council Ministries. Oversight committees can be established for these ministries, with parliamentarians who have no other responsibilities being appointed as their heads. Under the 13th Amendment, police powers have emerged as the most delicate issue in the transfer of authority to the Provincial Councils. As a result, I propose that it might be more practical for us to initially focus on reaching consensus concerning other powers. Its advisable to progress step by step. Prioritizing sensitive matters could potentially hinder the attainment of any mutual agreement. Instead of commencing with the end in mind, lets initiate from the beginning. Hence, lets initiate discussions about the decentralization of other powers and work towards a shared understanding. Additionally, we can draw insights from the Chief Ministers of the Souths report on power decentralization there. Our approach should be guided by mutual agreement. Lets emphasize that this Parliament possesses the strength and wisdom required to collaboratively make decisions that will shape the nations future. Hon Speaker, It is my sincere intention to progress without any political motivation, addressing the issues faced by the Tamil people in the North and East, in order to secure a much needed sustainable national reconciliation in the country. Reconciliation undoubtedly is an indispensable factor for Sri Lankas own development. My recent meeting with the Tamil Parliamentarians representing the Northern and Eastern provinces, was premised on this aspect. Subsequent to this meeting, I believe it is important to keep the Members of this august House informed of the matters discussed, as it forms the basis of the proposed trajectory, the Government would seek to pursue in this regard. In this context, continued action on the relevant issues are envisioned to contribute towards national reconciliation, which I will now seek to outline: a. Anti-Terrorism Bill Following the discussions of the suggested amendments to the Bill, it would be presented to the Cabinet for approval. Subsequent to appropriate action the Bill will be re-gazetted And any person can then petition the Supreme Court and the SC will have the last say with regards to the provisions of the bill. b. Anti- Corruption Bill I am pleased that the Anti- Corruption Bill was passed in Parliament last month with amendments proposed by the Supreme Court in its determination and other stakeholders, but without a vote. It has already been gazetted. c. Truth Seeking Mechanism and the Bill The Interim Secretariat for the Truth Seeking Mechanism has been established and a Director General been appointed. In addition three Divisions have been established covering Legal and Policy, Public Relations and Information Technology. Applications have been sought for key staff positions for the operationalization of the Secretariat, particularly for stakeholder consultations, preparations of drafting guidelines and policies, until the formal mechanisms could commence following relevant laws being enacted. Civil Society Stakeholder consultations including the UN agencies are continuing, and when exhausted, Cabinet approval will be sought and processed, to become a legal framework. d. Office for the National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) Bill ONUR draft law has been submitted to the Attorney-General for the certification of constitutionality, which will subsequently be presented to Parliament. Additionally, the National Action Plan on Reconciliation drafted by ONUR will be presented to the Cabinet in the near future. e. Office for Reparations At present payments of monetary relief have been granted for 203 cases of missing persons from the North East Conflict amounting to Rs. 40.6 million as at July 2023. The process is continuing. f. Office of Missing Persons (OMP) I reiterate the need to uphold justice for the people of the North and East. Of the 21,374 complaints received by the OMP, investigations into 3,462 cases have been completed at present. Investigations are progressing for the remaining complaints, and this process could get accelerated following the Truth Seeking Mechanism being fully operationalized. It would now be appropriate for those seeking particulars of missing persons to submit detailed information to the Interim Secretariat. I table the document containing the relevant information (Annex1) OMP has commenced tracking missing persons. Further, action is being taken to expedite the data entering process in order for its completion within three months. The issuance of the Certificate of Absence (COA) is being expedited. OMP and the AGs Department are working on a Case Handling Policy, and have drafted guidelines focusing on effective management of complaints to the previous Commissions and the OMP. Endorsement for the guidelines will be sought from the Cabinet. Further OMP with 10 new panels totaling 24, are expected to be in operation from August, and has planned to have a resource team per district for referral services. Members of Parliament are free to take up relevant issues with the Offices of Reparations and Missing Persons. The OMP has already outlined its time frames in relation to their scope of work. g. Granting Presidential Pardon to Prisoners involved in LTTE Activities Prisoners are under the three categories of remand prisoners numbering 21, prisoners imposed with death sentence 3 and those imposed with other sentences 22. It has been decided to consider only the last two categories of prisoners for being granted Presidential Pardon in terms of Article 34(1) of the Constitution. In this context, considering the recommendations of the Hon. Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, Presidential approval has been granted to remit the balance sentences and release 11 of the prisoners under the last category. h. Establishment of National Land Commission Steps are being taken to expedite the establishment of the National Land Commission (NLC) and a National Land Policy. A draft NLC law has been prepared and is being further studied for formulating a policy pertaining to the alienation of State land. A Land Commission Policy Act is also expected to be in place by September for the NLC to be guided in their functions. The composition of the NLC would be amended to include 9 representatives from the Provinces and 12 government officials. i. Resolution on Land Matters It may be recalled that an injunction order had been obtained from the Supreme Court in 2020 on the release of residual forest lands by a Special Committee. Subsequently following discussions in May this year the possibility of demarcating forests and wild life conservation areas based on the 1985 land used maps were requested to be examined. Consequently, a Cabinet memorandum on this issue was submitted and approval was obtained to enforce the release of such forest lands by an Inter-Ministerial Committee. The withdrawal of the original interim order is being processed. In the meantime a data base has been evolved focusing on the said land used maps, current land used patterns and proposals of the Divisional Secretaries related to the lands managed by the Forest Department in all districts of the North and East. Maps containing information related to the districts have been made available for viewing by the Members of Parliament in the relevant District Secretariats for a period of two months. I table the list of contact details of the relevant official for this purpose (Annex II). The proposals presented at the Divisional Secretariat level are to be considered by the Inter-Ministerial Committee following the legal proceedings on the withdrawal of the original interim order. A Committee chaired by the Secretary to the President will examine and facilitate matters relating to land. j. National Plan for Archaeology The Department of Archaeology and the Central Cultural Fund have been informed that land demarcation and excavation across the country should be done according to a National Plan. The Director General of Archaeology has been instructed to prioritize and plan excavation work, identification of sites and the manner in which they should be executed. An Action Plan will be presented by the Archaeological Department for the activities related to the identification of the areas to be conserved andor proper acquisition to take place. k. Road Map for the Issuance of All Country Passports for Sri Lankans living in Rehabilitation Camps in South India The Department of Immigration and Emigration has received a list of 2,678 Sri Lankans living in South Indian Rehabilitation Camps. Of the aforementioned number, those with both Sri Lankan Birth Certificates and National Identity Cards can be issued All Country Passports. The timelines for the issuance of the said documentation span two to four weeks. A considered decision would need to be taken with regard to the issuance of All Country Passports to those Sri Lankans living in Rehabilitation Camps in South India. l. Resettlement of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the North and East Provinces The Presidential Secretariat Northern Province Coordination Office has been established to assist the IDPs who have been affected due to the North and East conflict. As you are aware, people who were internally displaced in the North and East were accommodated in welfare centres or been living with their friends and relatives. After the restoration of normalcy, they have largely returned to their places of origin. Following the resettlement of a majority of the people with housing and livelihood support, its current status in the Northern and Eastern provinces is hereby tabled. (Annex III) Action continues to resettle IDP families in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Of the five districts in the Northern Province resettlement of IDPs remains only in Jaffna and Kilinochchi districts. In Jaffna there are 15 Welfare Centres with a total of 136 families and 2,175 families with friends and relatives. There are no IDP families living in Welfare Centres in Kilinochchi. However, 182 families remain with their friends and relatives in the Peninsula, and 177 in Pachchilaippalli Division. In the Eastern Province IDPs are present only in Trincomalee and Ampara districts and they live with friends and relatives, and there are no Welfare Camps in this Province. Particular attention has to be given to resolving problems associated with displaced persons resettlement, which also requires releasing privately held lands for public use. I have tasked the officials to take immediate action to settle these issues, by devising effective mechanisms for their resolution. m. Lands to be released by the Armed Forces- Northern Province Of the total land area in Jaffna amounting to approximately 253,283 acres, the occupation by the Security Forces and Police in 2009 was 26,812 acres. Presently 90 to 92 of the land occupied by the Security Forces and Police in 2009 have been released from time to time. Accordingly, 22,919 acres comprising 817 acres of state and 22,101 acres of private land have been released. The current extent of occupied land by the Security Forces and the Police is 3754 acres, of which 862 and 2892 acres are respectively state and privately owned. The further release of land is envisaged under the categories of: (i) Land for immediate release comprises 1.4 acres in Jaffna, 13 acres in Kilinochchi and 20 acres in Mullaithivu, as identified by the Army and Navy. (ii) The Army has earmarked 53 acres in the Jaffna district to be released in 3 to 6 months time. (iii) A land strip of approximately 290 acres from the Security Forces Army Cantonment, Palaly has been identified to be released temporarily for specific purposes, including agriculture and seasonal crops. (iv) Regarding lands that cannot be presently released, a study is being carried out in this regard on the instructions of the Army Commander, to ascertain the possibility of further freeing up of land in the Northern Province. I am aware that this is an area of contention for the Northern populace, and therefore we will continue to seek ways and means to release as far as possible the military occupied land in that Province. There will be certain mattes that MPs in those areas may want to raise. They may suggest different timelines and amendments so Ive asked the Foreign Minister and the Justice Minister to deal with all such requests. n. Development Plans for North and East It is imperative to create extensive and practicable Plans to develop the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Anticipating that renewable energy could meet 70 of the countrys national electricity need by 2030, one of the key objectives of the both Northern and Eastern Development Plans is to harness the regions renewable energy potential through the production of green hydrogen and green ammonia using innovative technologies. This strategy aims to attract investments and could transform the Port of Colombo Pooneryn and even Trincomalee as hubs for export of green hydrogen. We have already taken steps on creating a conducive environment for the investment and export of solar and wind power, culminating in a Memorandum of Understanding with India to facilitate collaborative efforts in this area. Adani Group has come forward to invest in the renewable energy sector of Sri Lanka. I believe that this collaborative approach would lead to substantial growth in this area. Additionally the  Water to the North programme, comprises the development of various water ways. In this context the Government has already approved the projects for the Poonekeri Tank and Malwathu Oya irrigation which is being prioritized. Talks are presently continuing on the River for Jaffna, which would bring fresh water to the Jaffna Lagoon and increase the capacity of the Iranamadu Tank. The Small Tanks Renewal Project, is important to be accomplished. In fact this project will give rise to developing the agricultural and solar energy sectors in the Northern Province. In addition to this, the Economic sub-committee of Cabinet is today considering two Cabinet Papers. One by the Minister of Irrigation and the other by the Minister of Water Supply to look at the development of water supply of the Jaffna peninsula and other Projects. There will be a committee chaired by my senior advisor Dr. R. Samaratunga to look at them and make a combined plan. It is also essential to upgrade air and sea connectivity in the North. The development of the KKS Harbour, Vavuniya and Palali Airports and the ferry service connecting the Northern Province to the South of India are facilities which have been earmarked. The establishment of Investment Promotion Zones in KKS, Paranthan and Mankulam are being worked towards. I will get the Board of Investment (BOI) to take these over. We also have plans for the development of tourists attractions in Jaffna and Mannar, through a tourist boating project around Mannar Fort, Kankesanthurai Port, the Islands and Vadamarachchi. Under an Agriculture Modernization programme we will seek to promote coconut cultivation in the Vanni. Jaffna being home to a seat of excellence in higher education with its University, would lend to developing it as an University City. Additionally, land has been identified in KKS for the establishment of a Campus under the aegis of SLIIT. Similarly plans for developing the Eastern Province are progressing with Trincomalee being the core. Indias assistance as our closest neighbour in implementing the Trincomalee District Development Project is of immense value to Sri Lanka. The ongoing cooperation in the development of the Trincomalee Tank Farms and Indias agreement to further enhance Trincomalee as a national and regional hub of industry, energy and economic activity is a fillip for developing further mutually beneficial cooperation. The Eastern Province plays an important role in naval affairs and Trincomalee should be made into a leading strategic Port. It is important that we work together with India when developing the Eastern Province Port, by having discussions on several programmes in that region. Further we cannot limit the economic activities of this Port solely to the Trincomalee District. This should be connected with the cities of Anuradhapura, Vavuniya and Dambulla, especially when the districts of Vanni, Eastern and North Central Provinces are responsible for the bulk of agricultural production. Since India has a lead to develop industries in this Province, an Industrial Zone should be created. The Port therefore will also be connected and we are planning to establish a Joint Task Force for this purpose. From an economic point of view the Eastern Province has much to offer the tourism industry. In particular, there is the cultural triangle of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Dambulla, which is in close proximity to the Eastern Province and could be a natural route for enhanced visits by tourists to the beach fronted cities of Batticaloa, Arugam Bay and Trincomalee. Cabinet also approved Subana Jurong to cover planning from Werugalaaru to Arugam Bay for tourism purposes. Cruise tourism initiatives could also be a part of this development plan. The fisheries, agriculture and animal husbandry sectors are well poised for modernization in the Eastern Province. In this context, the opening of Land Systems A and B of the Mahaweli right bank will provide the much needed impetus for enhancing agricultural pursuits. I hope that the some of the Hon. Members of the Parliament who continue a misplaced refrain of the Government purportedly selling out the country to a third party, will now constructively understand that no country can progress alone, that too especially in the instance of a nation emerging from an unprecedented economic crisis, as has been the experience of Sri Lanka. It must be understood that engaging in a robust relationship with our closest neighbour India would undoubtedly strengthen our ability towards ensuring mutually beneficial cooperation. You have my assurance that I will not engage in initiatives inimical to the sovereignty and integrity of this country. In the same manner I urge all of you, for constructive engagement, in our quest for national reconciliation, considering that the interests of the people is the bedrock for our countrys development. Today, we find ourselves navigating the challenging process of rebuilding a collapsed economy. This is a crucial juncture where we must strive for swift economic growth. However, achieving such rapid development seems unlikely within the existing provincial council system. In 1977, during President JR Jayawardenes tenure, our nation experienced remarkable economic progress. Unfortunately, due to the war, that progress was impeded, affecting every citizen profoundly. Under the presidency of Mahinda Rajapaksa, the war was successfully concluded. It has now been 14 years since the conflict ended. Regrettably, we have not yet managed to address the issues concerning power devolution and provincial councils. Hence, lets collectively endeavour as a united nation to tackle this challenge. We must find solutions to our dilemmas within our own capabilities. External parties or foreign nations cannot solve our issues for us. Instead, lets unite to resolve our problems independently and guide our country back towards a path of swift economic and social growth. Over the course of the past year since assuming the role of President, weve introduced a range of systemic reforms, highlighting transparency, accountability, responsibility, and good governance. In a time devoid of significant external influence for a constitutional amendment, I presented the 21st constitutional amendment to this House, which was adopted and led to a reduction in presidential powers. The Election Expenses Control Act was brought before Parliament and ratified to curb various misuses of finances and irregularities during elections. Notably, a robust anti-corruption bill, aligned with international standards, was presented and approved to confront the corruption and fraud that have marred our nations reputation. To prevent reckless financial management driven by political agendas, the Central Bank Independence Act was presented and passed. Amidst previous youth movements and a widespread demand for systemic change, the need for an altered approach was vigorously underscored. A substantial portion of our population is echoing this call for change. Just as in the steps mentioned earlier, we embarked on transformative measures, now we must steer this transformation towards the provincial councils. An opportunity presents itself to bring about a substantial shift, forging an efficient, transparent, and corruption-free provincial council system that the public can trust, one that effectively addresses their concerns. Moreover, provincial councils can be harnessed to foster greater unity among citizens and consolidate national cohesion. Ive laid out my proposals and strategies before this esteemed assembly. The floor is now yours. I encourage you to delve deeply into these propositions and express your viewpoints. Within this Honourable House, you possess the authority to chart the course forward from here. I implore each of you to take that step together through a mutual consensus. I beseech this honourable assembly to join hands and affirm that our parliament possesses the strength and comprehensive knowledge to usher in the betterment of our nation. Thank you",

        "date": "August 9, 2023 04:15 pm",
        "content": "A U.S. judge rejected Googles bid to dismiss a lawsuit claiming it invaded the privacy of millions of people by secretly tracking their internet use. U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on Monday said she could not find that users consented to letting Google collect information about what they viewed online because the Alphabet unit never explicitly told them it would. David Boies, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the proposed 5 billion class action, called the decision an important step in protecting the privacy interests of millions of Americans. The plaintiffs alleged that Googles analytics, cookies and apps let the Mountain View, California-based company track their activity even when they set Googles Chrome browser to Incognito mode and other browsers to private browsing mode. They said this let Google learn enough about their friends, hobbies, favorite foods, shopping habits, and potentially embarrassing things they seek out online, becoming an unaccountable trove of information so detailed and expansive that George Orwell could never have dreamed it. In a 36-page decision, Rogers said the plaintiffs showed there was a market for their data, citing a Google pilot program that paid users 3 a day for their browsing histories. The Oakland, California-based judge also pointed to several Google statements, including in its privacy policy, suggesting limits on information it might collect. Taken as a whole, a triable issue exists as to whether these writings created an enforceable promise that Google would not collect users data while they browsed privately, Rogers wrote. Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said the company strongly disputed the plaintiffs claims and would defend itself vigorously against them. Incognito mode in Chrome gives you the choice to browse the internet without your activity being saved to your browser or device, he said. As we clearly state each time you open a new incognito tab, websites might be able to collect information about your browsing activity during your session. The lawsuit covers Google users since June 1, 2016. It seeks at least 5,000 of damages per user for violations of federal wiretapping and California privacy laws. The case is Brown et al v Google LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 20-03664. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "August 9, 2023 06:09 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankan cricketer Danushka Gunthilaka, who has been stranded in Australia for more than eight months, will be allowed to travel domestically after his bail conditions were eased on Tuesday (08 August). Danushka Gunathilaka wore black pants and a black heavy jacket when he appeared in Sydney Downing Centre District Court on Tuesday to ask the court for leniency on his bail. He has previously pleaded not guilty to raping a woman in her Sydney home while he was in the country for the T20 World Cup last year. The cricketer was arrested and charged in November last year as he prepared to fly home to Sri Lanka with his teammates, and he has since been prevented from leaving the country. He was granted bail on November 17 with strict conditions that he surrender his passport and not approach any international point of departure. On Tuesday, the 32-year-old asked the court to vary his bail to allow him to travel within Australia on two occasions this month. Acting Judge Graeme Henson agreed to allow Mr Gunathilaka to suspend the prohibition on approaching international departure points for four days this week and four days at the end of the month. He stipulated that the cricketer must notify police at least 48 hours in advance with the duration of his trip, the location, and an itinerary if he plans to travel within Australia. However, the 32-year-old is still required to report to police three times a week and only allowed to possess one mobile phone. He is prohibited from using dating sites or apps due to the allegations against him. Police allege the cricketer matched with a woman on a dating app and chatted with her a number of times online before they met. The pair had drinks in the city before they went back to the womans home in the eastern suburbs of Sydney around 11pm, according to police. Mr Gunathilaka allegedly ignored the womans request to take it slow and instead sexually assaulted the 29-year-old woman in her home. Police allege the cricketer engaged in forceful intercourse with the woman during which he choked the woman three times. The woman told police she was too afraid to do anything and she had only consented to sexual intercourse with the cricket star if he agreed to wear a condom. The woman later found the condom on the floor beside the bed, according to police. The court was told the sexual assault charge related to stealthing, the non-consensual removal of a condom during sex. He is due to face a judge-alone trial in September.

        "date": "August 9, 2023 06:10 pm",
        "content": "The Colombo Magistrates Court today (09 August) ordered the Borella Police to conduct further investigations into the recent death of a three-year-old at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital, based on the medical reports and evidence presented thus far. The relevant order was issued by Colombo Additional Magistrate Rajindra Jayasuriya, upon consideration of the facts presented by the police when the case was taken up in court this morning. The Additional Magistrate pointed out that despite medical claims that the childs kidneys were located abnormally, medical reports have evidenced the fact that they were, in fact, located anatomically right, and thus called for a comprehensive investigation in this regard. Police then informed the court that one of the childs kidneys which had been removed during the surgery still remains at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital in Borella. Subsequently, the deceased childs father, Mohomed Nizar Mohomed Fazleem, also gave evidence pertaining to the case, under the guidance of the Borella Police. On 29 July, the death of three-year-old Hamdi Fazleen was reported following a kidney surgery at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital. The childs death is believed to have been caused after the doctor had rather carelessly surgically removed both kidneys, later claiming that the child was suffering from a rare condition, due to which his kidneys were located abnormally. It was later reported that the doctor responsible for the surgery in question has fled the country.",

        "title": "Decisive actions needed against state officials who fail to back govt.s development initiatives  State Minister",
        "date": "August 9, 2023 07:13 pm",
        "content": "State Minister of Fisheries Piyal Nishantha de Silva highlighted that to materialize President Ranil Wickremesinghes vision for 2048, its imperative for all to collaborate cohesively. He expressed these views today (09) during a press conference themed Collective Path to a Stable Country held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. He also said that decisive actions must be taken concerning state officials who fail to align with the governments forward-moving agenda. Failure to make these determinations threatens the gradual collapse of the fishing industry. Should such a collapse occur, the recovery process will be arduous and time-consuming, he said. State Minister Piyal Nishantha further said; President Ranil Wickremesinghe has formulated a targeted plan aiming for a transformative national change by 2048. The implementation of such a program entails the responsible ministrys commitment to its duties. Consequently, numerous specialized initiatives have been enacted during this period to achieve the Presidents objectives. The ministry has actively engaged in addressing fishermens welfare and challenges, focusing on technology adoption for the fishing industry progress and enhancing international relations. Yearly programs in alignment with World Fisheries Days have been instituted, including initiatives like Dola Rala Saviya and Rala Pela Dinana Daruwo. These programs extend services to benefit fishing communities, such as insurance, pensions, and savings schemes for children. The Ministry of Fisheries has adopted a holistic approach to engage the public, partnering with affiliated institutions for comprehensive initiatives. Beyond its conventional role, the ministry has initiated broad-reaching programs to promote behavioral change within fishing families, notably the Diriya Deewara Amma campaign, which addresses parental qualities and drug awareness. A novel cooling system has been incorporated into a vessel, marking a pioneering effort to mitigate post-harvest losses within the fishing industry. This advanced vessel has been launched, effectively curbing post-harvest damages. Consumers have experienced the brunt of escalating fish prices due to climatic influences and disruptions caused by religious festivities, leading to decreased fishing activity. These factors have hindered fish availability in the market. While some officials dutifully fulfill their responsibilities, others lack comprehension of the ministrys objectives, resulting in a regrettable situation. The success of President Ranil Wickremesinghes envisioned program necessitates a collaborative approach from politicians, government officials, and other stakeholders. Pointing fingers solely at politicians wont suffice; a unified approach is essential. Its imperative for everyone within this sector, including government officials, to work cohesively, transcending individual agendas. By adopting such a unified stance, we can contribute to the advancement of our nation. Cabinet Minister Douglas Devananda and I, as the Minister of State, are committed to this cause, alongside numerous officials who share a dedication to our country and its fishing communities. As a united team, we are prepared to tackle forthcoming challenges, appreciating the collective support extended towards overcoming these obstacles. Decisive actions must be taken concerning officials who dont align with the governments forward-moving agenda. Failure to make these determinations threatens the gradual collapse of the fishing industry. Should such a collapse occur, the recovery process will be arduous and time-consuming.",

        "title": "Pakistan: Imran Khan barred from politics for five years",
        "date": "August 9, 2023 07:19 pm",
        "content": "The former prime minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, has been barred from holding public office for five years by the countrys electoral authorities. The decision was announced by the Election Commission of Pakistan three days after Mr Khan was sentenced to three years in prison for corruption. Tuesdays announcement also means Mr Khan will be dismissed as an MP. He maintains the charges are politically motivated, but the Pakistani government denies this. Marriyum Aurangzeb, Pakistans minister of information and broadcasting, told the BBC before the announcement: You have to be accountable for your deeds in law. This has nothing to do with politics. A person who has been proven guilty by the court has to be arrested. Mr Khan, 70, was elected as Pakistans leader in 2018, but was ousted in a no-confidence vote last year after falling out with the countrys powerful military. His guilty verdict on Saturday was centred on charges he incorrectly declared details of presents from foreign dignitaries and proceeds from their alleged sale. The gifts - reported to be worth more than 140m Pakistani rupees (635,000; 500,000) - included Rolex watches, a ring and a pair of cufflinks. Local media reported that Mr Khans disqualification from running in any elections for five years was in line with that guilty ruling. Under Pakistani laws, a convicted person cannot run for public office for a period set out by the Election Commission of Pakistan. His legal team has challenged the guilty verdict and the case will be heard in the Islamabad High Court on Wednesday. The former prime minister is currently being held in a prison near Islamabad.
