        "content": "The distribution of ballot papers for postal voting for 113 local government bodies has concluded, the National Election Commission has announced. Commissioner General of Elections Saman Sri Ratnayake noted that postal voting will take place as planned for local government bodies that are not affected by legal challenges. Marking of postal votes for the 2025 Local Government (LG) Election is scheduled to be held on April 22, 23 and 24 at all District Secretariats and election offices. Those unable to mark postal votes on the aforementioned dates can do so on April 28 and 29, the Election Commission said. Meanwhile, the Court of Appeal yesterday issued a stay order preventing any further action in relation to the conduct of elections for several local government authorities, including the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC). Accordingly, the continuation of activities related to holding elections to elect members to the Colombo Municipal Council and Harispaththuwa, Panwila, Pathadumbara, Udapalatha and Kuliyapitiya Pradeshiya Sabhas has been temporarily suspended through the order. This order was issued after granting leave to proceed with writ petitions filed by several political parties and independent groups, challenging the rejection of their nominations. Accordingly, the Court directed that objections to the petitions be filed on or before May 5. The petitioners were further instructed to file any counter-objections, if necessary, by May 7. The Appeals Court scheduled the hearing of the petitions for May 16, and ordered that the stay order will remain in effect until that date. The petitions have been submitted by political parties and independent groups seeking a declaration that the decisions made by the respective returning officers to reject their nomination paperson the grounds that the submissions were not made within the prescribed time periodare unlawful. The 2025 Local Government Election is scheduled to be held on 6 May.",

        "title": "Scientists resurrect the dire wolf, a species that went extinct 12,500 years ago",
        "date": "April 8, 2025 02:10 pm",
        "content": "A species of wolf that died out some 12,500 years ago lives again as the worlds first successfully de-extincted animal, according to Dallas-based biotech company Colossal Biosciences. Colossal scientists have created three dire wolf pups by using ancient DNA, cloning and gene-editing technology to alter the genes of a gray wolf, the prehistoric dire wolfs closest living relative, the company announced Monday. The result is essentially a hybrid species similar in appearance to its extinct forerunner. The dire wolf, Aenocyon dirus, which was the inspiration for the fearsome canine featured in the HBO TV series Game of Thrones, was a top predator that once roamed North America. (HBO shares parent company Warner Bros. Discovery with CNN.) Dire wolves were larger in size than gray wolves and had a slightly wider head, light thick fur and stronger jaw, the company said. Colossal has been working toward resurrecting the mammoth, dodo and Tasmanian tiger since 2021, but the company had not previously publicized its work on dire wolves. This massive milestone is the first of many coming examples demonstrating that our end-to-end de-extinction technology stack works, said Ben Lamm, Colossals cofounder and CEO, in a news release. Our team took DNA from a 13,000 year old tooth and a 72,000 year old skull and made healthy dire wolf puppies. The three dire wolves are living on a 2,000-acre site at an undisclosed location enclosed by 10-foot-tall (3-meter-tall) zoo-grade fencing, where they are monitored by security personnel, drones and live camera feeds. Colossal said the facility had been certified by the American Humane Society and registered with the US Department of Agriculture. Dire wolf fossils and ancient DNA Using ancient DNA extracted from two dire wolf fossils, Colossals scientists and collaborators said they were able to assemble two high-quality Aenocyon dirus genomes, or complete sets of genetic information. The team compared the genomes with those of living canids such as wolves, jackals and foxes to identify the genetic variants for traits specific to dire wolves, such as white coats and longer, thick fur. The company then used the information from the genetic analysis to alter gray wolf cells, making 20 edits in 14 genes before cloning the most promising cell lines and transferring them into donor eggs, according to the news release. Healthy developing embryos were then transferred into surrogates for interspecies gestation, with three pregnancies that led to births of the first de-extinct species, Colossal revealed in its statement. The company confirmed to CNN that it used domestic dogs  specifically large, mixed-breed hounds  as surrogates. Two male dire wolf pups were born on October 1, 2024, while a female pup was born on January 30, 2025, according to Colossal Biosciences. Gene editing for de-extinction To achieve its goal, the company essentially created a hybrid genome using CRISPR technology to cut away certain gray wolf gene variants and replace them with traits associated with dire wolves, said Love Dalén, a professor in evolutionary genomics based at the Centre for Palaeogenetics at Stockholm University, and an adviser to Colossal. Theres no secret that across the genome, this is 99.9 gray wolf. There is going to be an argument in the scientific community regarding how many genes need to be changed to make a dire wolf, but this is really a philosophical question, Dalén said. It carries dire wolf genes, and these genes make it look more like a dire wolf than anything weve seen in the last 13,000 years. And that is very cool. Dalén, who said he had been a little bit involved in the analysis of the dire wolf genomes but had not personally met the dire wolf pups or been involved in the gene editing or cloning process, said the work by the scientists was a huge leap from anything done in the field in the past. The way I see this is that they have resurrected the dire wolf phenotype (the observable traits of a species) and we know from the genome that they probably looked a bit like these puppies. To me, its a dire wolf in that sense, he said. Colossal has raised at least 435 million since Lamm, a serial entrepreneur, and Harvard University geneticist George Church, founded the company in September 2021 and first announced plans to resurrect the mammoth. That endeavor has taken longer than Lamm initially projected, with the company saying its on track to introduce the first woolly mammoth calves in 2028. The company hopes the same technologies that created the dire wolf can directly help endangered animals as well. Colossal said on Monday it has produced two litters of cloned red wolves, the most critically endangered wolf species, using a new, less invasive approach to cloning developed during the dire wolf research. Many critics of de-extinction argue that the huge sums of money invested in the project could be better spent elsewhere  and that raising and breeding the hybrid creatures could imperil living animals used as surrogates. However, Christopher Preston, a professor of environmental philosophy at the University of Montana, said Colossal appears to be paying attention to animal welfare issues, noting the size of the facility and support from the American Humane Society. Colossal have taken thoughtful precautions to screen against any unintended genetic consequences of their edits, eliminating risky edits known to be associated with poor outcomes, he added. But he said its hard to imagine the dire wolves playing a role in an ecosystem, an outcome the company has said is the ultimate goal of its efforts to create genetically engineered mammoths. In states like Montana, we are currently having trouble keeping a healthy population of gray wolves on the land in the face of amped up political opposition, Preston said. It is hard to imagine dire wolves ever being released and taking up an ecological role. So, I think it is important to ask what role the new animals will serve. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Member of Parliament Namal Rajapaksa says that politically driven delays in development projects in Sri Lanka resulted in an energy crisis that ultimately led to the countrys worst financial crisis. Speaking during a special address themed The South Asian Platter: Menu for Growth at the Rising Bharat Summit held in India today (April 8), Rajapaksa stressed that development efforts must be carried out without delay, highlighting the importance of acting when the moment demands it. We must implement and execute what has to be done at that given time. What we saw in the past couple of yearsbecause we purely ignored certain development projects based on political reasonsfor example, Sampur was supposed to be started in 2015, and similarly many other projects were delayed like Uma Oya from the Iranian fundingand as a result, in 2022 we faced an energy crisis that later turned into a financial crisis, MP Rajapaksa stressed. Commenting on the impact of US trade tariffs to the South Asian region, Namal Rajapaksa urged South Asian nations to move beyond political divisions and pursue regional cooperation to tackle shared development challenges. Highlighting the urgency of regional partnerships, Rajapaksa emphasized the potential of South-South collaboration, especially among Indian Ocean nations, stating, This is the time that the region should get together, and Indian Ocean countries have to get together and build new partnerships on trade. What has happen in Washington will not only affect directly to Sri Lankan apparel or the exportsbut also the maritime industry in Sri Lanka. You know, we are heavily depending on trade and logistics as well at the same time, Rajapaksa added. The parliamentarian also underlined the importance of strengthening ties with regional powers. This is something we need to work together with countries like India, to see how we can work new alliances and build new partnerships within the region, he added. When asked about the challenges of advocating reform while being linked to a prominent political family, Rajapaksa acknowledged the complexities, and expressed, Its how you project yourself and how you face it, because its going to be always challenging. Politics is not an easy profession to be in. The circumstances change. As politicians and as political parties, we should reform around it. It will be challenging, but its all about how we face it and understanding the global context as wellbecause politics is no more conceited on your own constitution or only to your own country, he added.",

        "date": "April 8, 2025 03:23 pm",
        "content": "China plans to ban Hollywood movies after saying it will never accept the blackmail nature of the United States following President Donald Trumps escalated tariff threats against Beijing. It will put more tariffs on US agricultural products like soybeans, block all US poultry from entering China and ban the import of US movies into the country, a Chinese journalist linked to the Communist party told BBCs Radio 4 programme. US films grossed 585million in China last year, which is about 3.5 per cent of Chinas 17.71billion box office and among the largest share of foreign films. A ban on American movies would cause upcoming releases like Jurassic World: Rebirth, the Accountant 2 and the Mission Impossible sequel lose out on hundreds of millions of dollars in the Chinese market. US President Trump said yesterday that he will impose an additional 50 per cent tariff on China if Beijing does not withdraw its retaliatory tariffs on the US, which China swiftly labelled blackmail and drew up plans to ban certain US imports in response. The US threats were a mistake on top of a mistake, once again exposing the American sides blackmailing nature, the Chinese commerce ministry said in a statement this morning, urging the US to properly resolve differences with China through dialog with mutual respect and on an equal footing. Tariff wars have no winners, and protectionism has no way out. Chinese people dont make trouble, but are not afraid of it. Pressure, threats and blackmail are not the right way to deal with China, foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said. If Trump sticks to his plan for an additional 50 per cent tariff on China unless it withdraws its retaliatory levies on the US, total new US duties on Chinese goods this year could rise to 104 per cent by Wednesday.

Accordingly, the All Share Price Index (ASPI) rose by 467.26 points (3.19) to close at 15,127.71 while the SP SL20 gained 190.29 points (4.46) to close at 4,455.13 points. The days turnover was recorded as over Rs. 2.89 billion. The announcement of new tariffs by US President Donald Trump has not only sent shockwaves across the globe, it also resulted in Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) losing Rs. 430 billion in three days of trading. Trump announced on Wednesday (April 2) a 10 per cent baseline tariff on imported goods and harsher reciprocal levies on dozens of countries, including key allies such as European Union (EU) members, Japan and Israel. Sri Lanka was also at the receiving end of a 44 per cent reciprocal tariff. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the government have taken certain measures to reassure the investors and business owners. Dissanayake appointed a committee to conduct an in-depth study on potential issues that may arise due to the new reciprocal tariff system introduced by US President Donald Trump and to submit recommendations to the government. Despite the measures, the CSE has lost ground significantly during trading. At the end of trading on Wednesday (April 2), the All Share Price Index (ASPI) was at 16,007.44 while it was at 14,660.45 yesterday. This is a drop of 1,346.99 points or 8.41. Yesterday alone, the ASPI dropped by 712.9 points (-4.64) which is Rs. 227 billion in value.

The enhanced privacy and parental controls, which were introduced on Instagram last year, will address concerns about how teens are spending their time on social media, the company said. Why Its Important Metas expansion of safety features for teens comes as some lawmakers say they plan to press ahead with proposed legislation, such as the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), seeking to protect children from social media harms. Meta, ByteDances TikTok and Googles YouTube already face hundreds of lawsuits filed on behalf of children and school districts about the addictive nature of social media. In 2023, 33 U.S. states including California and New York sued the company for misleading the public about the dangers of its platforms. Context Meta said teens under 16 will require parental permission before they can go live and disable a feature that automatically blurs images potentially containing nudity in direct messages. We will start including these updates in the next couple of months, the company said. In July 2024, the U.S. Senate advanced two online safety bills  KOSA and The Children and Teens Online Privacy Protection Act  that would force social media companies to take responsibility for how their platforms affect children and teens. The Republican-led House declined to bring KOSA up for a vote last year, but suggested at a committee hearing late last month that they still plan to press ahead with new laws to protect kids online. Top platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, allow users who are 13 years of age and above to sign up. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "First baby born in UK to woman with transplanted womb",
        "date": "April 8, 2025 06:55 pm",
        "content": "A miracle baby girl has become the first child in the UK to be born to a mother using a donated womb. The babys mum, Grace Davidson, 36, was born without a functioning uterus, and received her sisters womb in 2023  in what was then the UKs only successful womb transplant. Two years after that pioneering operation, Grace gave birth to her first child in February. She and her husband, Angus, 37, have named their daughter Amy after Graces sister, who donated her womb. Holding baby Amy - who weighed just over two kilos (four and a half pounds) - for the first time was incredible and surreal, new mum Grace says. It was quite overwhelming because wed never really let ourselves imagine what it would be like for her to be here, she says. It was really wonderful. Grace and Angus, who live in north London but are originally from Scotland, hope to have a second child using the transplanted womb. The couple initially wished to remain anonymous, but following the safe arrival of baby Amy are now speaking to the BBC about their little miracle. The surgical team told the BBC they have carried out three further womb transplants using deceased donors since Graces transplant. They aim to carry out a total of 15 as part of a clinical trial. Grace was born with a rare condition, Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, where the womb is missing or underdeveloped, but with functioning ovaries. When the BBC first spoke to her in 2018, she was hoping her mother could donate her uterus to allow her to have children - but it proved to be unsuitable. The BBC met Grace and husband Angus again in 2019 when one of Graces two sisters, Amy Purdie, was being assessed to find out if she could donate her womb to Grace. Amy and her husband already had two children and did not want any more. Prior to surgery both sisters had counselling. Grace and Angus also had fertility treatment and still have several embryos in storage. Grace says she was given the option of surrogacy or adoption, but carrying her own baby felt really important. I have always had a mothering instinct, she says, but for years I had been suppressing it because it was too painful to go there. The first baby born as a result of a womb transplant was in Sweden in 2014. Since then around 135 such transplants have been carried out in more than a dozen countries, including the US, China, France, Germany, India and Turkey. Around 65 babies have been born. Originally scheduled to take place in late 2019, the sisters transplant operation fell through and then looked in doubt for several years during the Covid pandemic. When it eventually took place, in February 2023, it took a team of more than 30 medics around 17 hours to remove Amys womb and transplant it to Grace. Isabel Quiroga, the surgeon who led the transplant team at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford, says although the procedure carried risks for both sisters, it was life-enhancing and life-creating - and you cant have better than that. Amy says she did not feel the sense of loss some women experience after a hysterectomy, because of the dramatic and immediate benefits to her sister. Grace had her first ever period within two weeks of the transplant and became pregnant on the first attempt at IVF. It was incredible to feel her babys first kick, she says, adding the entire pregnancy had been really special. Baby Amy was born by Caesarean section at Queen Charlottes hospital in west London on 27 February. It was an incredible moment, full of joy, says surgeon Isabel Quiroga. Grace and Angus say they hope to have a second child - as soon as the medical team say the time is right. The donated womb will be removed after the birth of a second child. This will allow Grace to stop taking the daily immunosuppressants she is currently on to ensure her body does not reject her sisters womb. Taking these drugs can increase the risks of developing some cancers, especially if taken over many years - but surgeon Isabel Quiroga says these risks should return to baseline once the womb is removed. Prof Richard Smith, a gynaecological surgeon at Imperial College Healthcare, who led the organ retrieval team, has been researching womb transplantation for more than two decades. He says his team is thrilled about the birth of baby Amy. Im not often short of words but when the baby came out I was speechless - there were a lot of tears in the theatre that day. The whole thing is astonishing and incredibly moving, Prof Smith adds. He says Amys birth will give hope to many of the 15,000 women in the UK of childbearing age who do not have a functioning uterus, of whom around 5,000 were born without a womb. Mr Smith heads a charity called Womb Transplant UK, which paid the NHS costs for Graces transplant operation. All the medical staff gave their time for free. He told the BBC around 10 women have embryos in storage or are undergoing fertility treatment, a requirement for being considered for womb transplantation. Each transplant costs around 30,000, he says, and the charity has sufficient funds to do two more. The surgical team has permission to perform 15 womb transplants as part of a clinical trial, five with living and 10 with deceased donors. No details have been made public about the three women who have so far received wombs from deceased donor organs. NHS Blood and Transplant told the BBC extra consent is sought from families for such rare donations. Baby Amys father, Angus, says he and Grace will never be able to thank his wifes sister enough for enabling them to become parents. It was an absolute no brainer that they would name Amy after her aunt, Angus says. The babys middle name is Isabel, after the surgeon who led the womb transplantation team. For Grace, having baby Amy has brought her even closer to her sister. It was incredibly difficult to let her do that for me, she says, its a huge act of sisterly love. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "A meeting between President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and senior officials of SriLankan Airlines was held this afternoon (April 8) at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo. The discussions mainly focused on proposals to transform SriLankan Airlines into a more profitable state-owned enterprise. Special attention was also given to possible short-term and long-term solutions for the airlines debt management, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. The talks further explored new investment opportunities for the airline. The President instructed the officials to take all necessary steps to transform SriLankan Airlines into a profit-making entity. Although the airline has recorded operational profits, due to past mismanagement and poor decision-making, it remains one of the leading loss-making state enterprises. The current government has decided to reverse the previous administrations decision to privatize the airline. Instead, it plans to continue operating it as the national carrier while introducing a new management structure to ensure its profitability moving forward, according to the PMD. Minister of Labour and Deputy Minister of Economic Development Dr. Anil Jayantha Fernando, Presidents Senior Advisor Duminda Hulangamuwa, Chairman of SriLankan Airlines Sarath Ganegoda along with several senior officials of SriLankan Airlines, were present at the meeting. -PMD-",

        "date": "April 8, 2025 09:35 pm",
        "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he is waiting to hear from China before duties of more than 100 take effect, in a sign that he might be open to last-minute negotiations with the worlds No. 2 economic power. Global markets steadied after days of carnage prompted by Trumps sweeping levies, which have raised fears of recession and upended a global trading order that has been in place for decades. U.S. stock indexes opened sharply higher after a bruising selloff that has wiped out trillions of dollars since last week. Trump has already implemented a 10 tariff on almost all imports to the worlds largest consumer market, and targeted tariffs of up to 50 on many trading partners are due to take effect on Wednesday. China has refused to bow to what it called blackmail and vowed to fight to the end after Trump threatened to ratchet up tariffs to 104 in response to Chinas decision to match reciprocal duties Trump announced last week. Trump indicated that a resolution might be possible. China also wants to make a deal, badly, but they dont know how to get it started. We are waiting for their call. It will happen! he said on social media. Dozens of countries are offering concessions to head off the tariffs. Trumps administration says it has set up talks with several so far, including Japan and South Korea. China is bracing for a war of attrition, and manufacturers of goods from tableware to flooring are warning about profits, and scrambling to plan new overseas plants. Citing rising external risks, Citi cut its 2025 China GDP growth forecast to 4.2 from 4.7. Some companies are warning they will hike prices. Chipmaker Micron told customers it will impose a tariff-related surcharge starting Wednesday, while U.S. clothing retailers said they are delaying orders and holding off on hiring. Running shoes made in Vietnam that now retail for 155 will cost 220 when Trumps 46 tariff on that country takes effect, according to an industry group. Consumers are stocking up while they can. Im buying double of whatever - beans, canned goods, flour, you name it, Thomas Jennings, 53, said as he pushed a shopping cart through the aisles of a New Jersey Walmart. As the worlds two biggest economies traded blows, Chinas Foreign Ministry criticised as ignorant and impolite comments made by Vice President JD Vance in a recent Fox News interview. While defending Trumps tariffs, Vance criticised the U.S. economic model as harming its own workers: We borrow money from Chinese peasants to buy the things those Chinese peasants manufacture. Vietnam has requested a 45-day delay while Indonesia announced concessions for U.S. imports including reducing taxes on electronic goods and steel. Stock markets found a firmer footing on Tuesday after a gut-wrenching few days for investors which prompted some business leaders, including those close to Trump, to urge the president to reverse course. European shares bounced off 14-month lows after four straight sessions of heavy selling, while global oil prices steadied after falling to four-year lows. Wall Streets main indexes bounced back from a heavy selloff, led by technology stocks. Europe Eyes Counter-Measures The European Commission, meanwhile, is mulling counter-tariffs of 25 on a range of U.S. goods including soybeans, nuts and sausages, though other potential items like bourbon whiskey were left off the list. Officials said they stood ready to negotiate. The 27-member bloc is struggling with tariffs on autos and metals already in place, and faces a 20 tariff on other products on Wednesday. Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on EU alcoholic drinks. European pharma companies, also fearful of the tariff fallout, warned von der Leyen in a meeting that Trumps tariffs would expedite the industrys shift away from Europe and towards the United States.

        "date": "April 9, 2025 07:33 am",
        "content": "The United States said on Tuesday that 104 duties on imports from China will take effect shortly after midnight, even as the administration of President Donald Trump moved to quickly start talks with other trading partners targeted by sweeping tariffs. U.S. stocks dropped on Tuesday for a fourth straight trading day since Trumps tariffs announcement last week, with the SP 500 closing below 5,000 for the first time in almost a year. The index is now 18.9 below its most recent high on February 19, close to the 20 decline that defines a bear market. SP 500 companies have lost 5.8 trillion in stock market value since Trumps tariff announcement last Wednesday, the deepest four-day loss since the benchmark was created in the 1950s, according to LSEG data. Global markets had previously posted gains on hopes that Trump might be willing to negotiate down the array of country and product-specific trade barriers he is erecting around the worlds largest consumer market. Japans Nikkei saw a broad sell-off on Wednesday morning and other Asian markets were braced for falls, hours before the tariffs were set to take effect. The administration has scheduled talks with South Korea and Japan, two close allies and major trading partners, and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is due to visit next week. These are tailored, highly tailored deals, Trump said at a White House event, where he signed executive orders aimed at boosting coal production. Weve had talks with many, many countries, over 70, they all want to come in. Our problem is, cant see that many that fast. But the White House made clear that country-specific tariffs of up to 50 would nevertheless take effect at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time (0401 GMT), as planned. Those tariffs will be especially steep for China, as Trump has ratcheted up duties on its imports to 104 in response to countertariffs Beijing announced last week. China has refused to bow to what it called blackmail and has vowed to fight to the end. Administration officials said they would not prioritize negotiations with the worlds No. 2 economic power. Right now, weve received the instruction to prioritize our allies and our trading partners like Japan and Korea and others, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said on Fox News. Trumps tailor-made approach to negotiations with individual countries could take into account foreign and military aid as well as economic factors, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said. Trumps lead trade negotiator, Jamieson Greer, told Congress his office is trying to work quickly but is not facing a particular deadline. The president has been clear, again, that hes not doing exemptions or exceptions in the near term, Greer told lawmakers. At an evening speech to Republican lawmakers, Trump said he would soon announce major tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, arguing the duties would push drug companies to move manufacturing operations to the U.S. Trumps sweeping tariffs have raised fears of recession and upended a global trading order that has been in place for decades. China is bracing for a war of attrition, and manufacturers are warning about profits and scrambling to plan new overseas plants. Citing rising external risks, Citi cut its 2025 China GDP growth forecast to 4.2 from 4.7. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his countrys 25 tariff on some vehicles - a countermeasure to match Trumps approach - will take effect immediately after midnight. President Trump caused this trade crisis  and Canada is responding with purpose and with force, Carney said on X. Canada and Mexico were exempt from the new round of tariffs Trump announced last week, but previous levies remained in place. Most goods that comply with the existing trade agreement between the three countries are not subject to those tariffs. AMERICANS WORRIED ABOUT PRICES Three out of four Americans expect prices to rise as Trumps tariffs kick in, according to a ReutersIpsos poll. Chipmaker Micron (MU.O), opens new tab told customers it will impose a tariff-related surcharge starting on Wednesday, while U.S. clothing retailers said they are delaying orders and holding off on hiring. Running shoes made in Vietnam that now retail for 155 will cost 220 when Trumps 46 tariff on that country takes effect, according to an industry group. Consumers are stocking up while they can. Im buying double of whatever - beans, canned goods, flour, you name it, Thomas Jennings, 53, said as he pushed a shopping cart through the aisles of a New Jersey Walmart (WMT.N), opens new tab. Broad-based price hikes may not show up immediately, as tariffs will not apply to goods that were already in transit before they took effect. The market slide has prompted some business leaders, including those close to Trump, to urge the president to reverse course. Global oil prices steadied after falling to four-year lows. The European Commission, meanwhile, is mulling countertariffs of 25 on a range of U.S. goods including soybeans, nuts and sausages, though other potential items like bourbon whiskey were left off the list.

Advanced Level (AL) in schools across the country, particularly in urban national schools. Union Secretary Joseph Stalin stated that the government has failed to implement any concrete plans to address the shortage, despite consistent claims that the education sector is lacking approximately 30,000 teachers. The government keeps repeating theres a shortage, but theres no action to recruit teachers. National schools in cities like Colombo are severely affectedespecially when it comes to AL classes. Existing teachers are burdened with excessive workloads, and theres a dire need for English medium graduates in science and mathematics, as well as qualified IT teachers, Stalin stressed. He described the situation as a serious crisis that threatens the quality of education for thousands of students preparing for university entrance. Meanwhile, Director of the Postgraduate Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Peradeniya Prof. Wasantha Athukorala pointed to the booming informal tutoring sector as a direct consequence of these teacher shortages. Over Rs. 200 billion is now circulating in the tutoring industry, he revealed, citing the growing dependence of students and parents on private tuition to fill the gaps left by the formal education system. Prof. Athukorala also criticized the 2025 budget, saying it failed to address the longstanding issues in the education sector.",

        "date": "April 9, 2025 09:10 am",
        "content": "The roof of an iconic nightclub in the Dominican capital collapsed early Tuesday during a merengue concert attended by politicians, athletes and others, leaving at least 79 people dead and 160 injured, authorities said. Crews were searching for potential survivors in the rubble at the one-story Jet Set nightclub in Santo Domingo, said Juan Manuel Méndez, director of the Center of Emergency Operations. We continue clearing debris and searching for people, he said on Tuesday night. Were going to search tirelessly for people. Nearly 12 hours after the top of the nightclub collapsed onto patrons, rescue crews were still pulling out survivors from under the debris, shushing those around them so they could listen for faint cries for help. Firefighters removed blocks of broken concrete and used sawed pieces of wood as planks to lift heavy debris as the noise of drills breaking through concrete filled the air. Méndez said rescue crews were prioritizing three areas in the club: Were hearing some sounds. Nelsy Cruz, the governor of the northwestern province of Montecristi and sister of seven-time Major League Baseball All-Star Nelson Cruz, was among the victims. She had called President Luis Abinader at 12:49 a.m., saying she was trapped and that the roof had collapsed, first lady Raquel Abraje told reporters. Officials said Cruz died later at the hospital. This is too great a tragedy, Abraje said, her voice breaking. The Professional Baseball League of the Dominican Republic posted on X that former MLB pitcher Octavio Dotel, 51, also died. Officials had pulled Dotel from the debris earlier and brought him to a hospital. Also killed was Dominican baseball player Tony Enrique Blanco Cabrera, said league spokesman Satosky Terrero. Late Tuesday night, those still looking for their family and friends gathered around a man playing a guitar outside the club as they sang hymns. Officials said at least 160 people were injured, among them national lawmaker Bray Vargas. Relatives of merengue singer Rubby Pérez, who was performing when the roof collapsed, initially said that he had been rescued, but Méndez said later Tuesday that wasnt true. He said rescue crews were still looking for Pérez. Pérezs manager, Enrique Paulino, whose shirt was spattered with blood, told reporters at the scene that the concert began shortly before midnight, with the roof collapsing almost an hour later, killing the groups saxophonist. It happened so quickly. I managed to throw myself into a corner, he said, adding that he initially thought it was an earthquake. It wasnt immediately clear what caused the roof to collapse or when the Jet Set building was last inspected. The club issued a statement saying it was cooperating with authorities and noted that the owner, Antonio Espaillat, was out of the country and returned late Tuesday. There are no words to express the pain this event has caused. What happened has been devastating for everyone, he said. A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Public Works referred questions to the mayors office. A spokesperson for the mayors office did not respond to a message for comment. Prosecutor Rosalba Ramos told TV station CDN that while everyone wants to know what happened, authorities were still focused on finding survivors. They set up a makeshift morgue near the club while more than 120 people lined up to donate blood at two different centers. Manuel Olivo Ortiz, whose son attended the concert but did not return home, was among those anxiously waiting outside the club known for its traditional Monday parties where renowned national and international artists performed. Were holding on only to God, Olivo said. Also awaiting word was Massiel Cuevas, godmother of 22-year-old Darlenys Batista. Im waiting for her. Shes in there, I know shes in there, Cuevas said, firm in her belief that Batista would be pulled out alive. President Abinader wrote on X that all rescue agencies are working tirelessly to help those affected. We deeply regret the tragedy that occurred at the Jet Set nightclub. We have been following the incident minute by minute since it occurred, he wrote. Abinader arrived at the scene and hugged those looking for friends and family, some with tears streaming down their faces. We have faith in God that we will rescue even more people alive, he told reporters. An official with a megaphone stood outside the club imploring the large crowd that had gathered to search for friends and relatives to give ambulances space. You have to cooperate with authorities, please, he said. We are removing people. At one hospital where the injured were taken, an official stood outside reading aloud the names of survivors as a crowd gathered around her and yelled out the names of their loved ones. Meanwhile, dozens of people gathered at the National Institute of Forensic Pathology, which shared pictures of the victims so their loved ones could identify them. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "April 9, 2025 09:13 am",
        "content": "Despite a significant rise in US tariffs, most major global currencies have appreciated against the US dollar since the start of the year, according to Fitch Ratings latest FX Market Monitor. Fitch notes that developed market currenciesexcluding the Australian dollarhave risen by an unweighted average of 4.5 since the end of 2024. Analysts believe that market concerns over the potential negative impact of higher tariffs on US economic growth have outweighed the expected narrowing of the US trade deficit, leading to a weaker dollar. Emerging market currencies have shown more mixed trends. The Russian rouble has surged by around 30, while the Brazilian real and Polish zloty have also posted strong gains. In contrast, the Turkish lira and Indonesian rupiah have continued to weaken. Fitch Ratings adds since January 2023, the yen has depreciated by 12 against the US dollar, while the euro and the Swiss franc have strengthened (by 2.7 and 7, respectively). Among emerging markets, the number of Turkish lira per dollar has broadly doubled, while the Korean won and rupiah have depreciated by 15 and 7.5, respectively. The US dollars Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER)which reflects trade-weighted averages of bilateral exchange ratesremains near a multi-decade high, despite the greenbacks recent weakness. The NEER appreciated steadily from 2015 to 2024. Switzerlands NEER is at an all-time high, while the euro areas NEER has declined slightly from its peak in mid-2024. In contrast, Japan and the UK have seen their NEERs fall significantly compared to 2000by 26.5 and 15.8, respectively. Among Fitchs 20 emerging market economies, only China and Poland have recorded NEER appreciation since 2000. On a price-adjusted basis, Real Effective Exchange Rates (REERs) offer a more stable view. Japans REER, based on consumer prices, has declined by over 55 since 2000, while the UKs has dropped by more than 17. Switzerlands REER has steadily climbed, and euro area REERs have fallen moderately since the global financial crisis. Polands REER has increased by about a third, while Chinas has increased by 24 since 2000, notwithstanding the decrease since early 2022 related to deflationary pressures in the Chinese economy, the statement added.",

        "content": "A tense situation was reported at a privately-owned apparel factory in Udukawa, Weligama last night (April 8), after employees staged a protest against the managements decision to withhold the Sinhala and Tamil New Year bonus. The unrest began as the manager of the factory was held hostage in his office by disgruntled workers, following his announcement that the company could not afford to pay the annual bonus due to the steep tariffs recently imposed by the United States on Sri Lankan exports. According to sources, the corporates governing authority had informed employees last morning that the bonus payments will not be disbursed this year. This triggered a heated verbal altercation between the factory management and workers. Soon after, a group of employees blocked the entrance to the facility, locking the gates and bringing all operations to a standstill. They have vowed not to leave the premises until their demands are met. The factory management alerted the Weligama Police regarding the incident, prompting the deployment of special police security to the site. As of this morning (April 9), the protest is ongoing, with employees continuing to block access to the factory, Ada Derana reporter said.",

        "date": "April 9, 2025 10:45 am",
        "content": "With the expiration of the extension granted for Parate execution on March 31, 2025, the Government of Sri Lanka remains steadfast in its commitment to facilitate the revitalization of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development says. Issuing a statement in this regard, the Finance Ministry highlighted that in order to provide support to this sector, a relief period has been extended until December 31, 2025. For SMEs with borrowings below Rs. 25 million, provided they approached their respective banks on or before March 31, 2025, to discuss and secure relief measures. Similarly, SMEs with borrowings between Rs. 25 million and Rs. 50 million were granted an extension until September 30, 2025, while those exceeding Rs. 50 million received a deadline extension until June 30, 2025, to access assistance, the statement noted, adding that these benefits are available exclusively to SMEs that initiated discussions with banks before the March 31, 2025, cutoff date. Furthermore, the Finance Ministry stated that since the initiation of the relief program on December 15, 2024, key government agencies, including the Presidential Secretariat, Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, the Ministry of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the Sri Lanka Banks Association, and the Department of Development Financehave continuously monitored the implementation of the relief mechanism on a monthly basis. The Finance Ministry also said in the statement that it was observed during these monitoring efforts that some SMEs had not approached banks for discussions. In response, the Sri Lanka Banks Association launched a multilingual awareness campaign in national newspapers across Sinhala, Tamil, and English followed by social media promotions, encouraging SMEs to avail themselves of the benefits, it added. The ministry further clarified that it was noted that SMEs engaged with banks successfully secured relief benefits, which included interest reductions and extensions to repayment periods. Even though willful defaulters may not reach the banks, bankers are hopeful that despite the Parate extension is expired, many SMEs will come forward within the next few days to secure the benefits offered by the relief mechanism and Banks Association informed that their members are willing and ready to assist such SMEs, the ministry added. In the recently approved national budget, the government has allocated Rs. 20,000 million (Rs. 20 billion) as investment and working capital financing. This includes; Rs. 15,000 million for performing and non-defaulting SMEs and Rs. 5,000 million for defaulting SMEs with revival potential. The challenges relating to disbursement to non-performance sector was discussed extensively by the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, the Ministry of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development together with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka Banks Association and have identified options to expedite the releasing of Working Capital assistance to SMEs, the statement issued by the Finance Ministry read. As part of the solution, SMEs that are to be reviewed by the Ministry of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development are channeled to banks for access to the Rs. 5,000 million fund. Disbursement is subject to Central Bank issuing guidelines, supported by a reporting and recognizing framework developed by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, it added. This Rs. 20 billion facility is expected to ease urgent investment and working capital financial needs of SMEs, the ministry expressed, noting that the government is committed to ensuring the timely disbursement of these funds. Additionally, in a press release dated January 15, 2025, the Ministry announced additional measures for SMEs to ensure sustainability, of which the Advisory Committee was already established in February 2025. The ScorecardRating Mechanism developed by the Institute of Chartered Accountants was presented to the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, the Ministry of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the Sri Lanka Banks Association and other stakeholders. The Ministry of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development will use this ScorecardRating Mechanism when recommending SMEs eligible to access the Rs. 5,000 million facility. This mechanism will also be shared with banks to promote sustainable lending practices. However, the Finance Ministry assured that these comprehensive efforts are part of the governments broader strategy to create sustainability for SMEs to align with the production economy and enhance their contribution to GDP.",

Prime Minister Amarasuriya said the government, when it came to power last year, was fully focused on stabilizing the economy and ensuring democracy in the country by conducting the elections that were delayed. During the Prime Ministers questions session this morning, Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi (ITAK) Parliamentarian Shanakiyan Rasamanickam requested the Premier to inform the house as to when a new constitution will be drafted since it was one of the main election pledges of the government which was formed by the National Peoples Power (NPP). Responding to the question, Prime Minister Amarasuriya asserted that the new government is currently working on stabilizing the economy. She noted that two elections have been held in the past six months while another election will be held next month. The Prime Minister said the Provincial Council election is also due for several years. Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya said once the Provincial Council election is held, the government will commence the process to drafting a new constitution, Meanwhile, she acknowledged that the present government has not allocated funds for the process in this years budget. However, Prime Minister Amarasuriya said the present administration intends to continue the constitutional drafting process that had already commenced by the previous government through public consultations. She said therefore she is of the view that the drafting of the new constitution can be completed within a reasonable timeframe.",

        "date": "April 9, 2025 11:01 am",
        "content": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lowered its key repo rate on Wednesday for a second consecutive time and changed its monetary policy stance signalling room for more cuts ahead, as it seeks to boost the sluggish economy, which is facing further pressure from U.S. tariffs. As expected, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which consists of three RBI and three external members, cut the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.00. It started reducing rates with a quarter-point reduction in February, its first cut since May 2020. The central bank changed its stance to accommodative from neutral. Indian equity markets have fallen 4 since U.S. President Donald Trumps tariff announcements and economists estimated growth in the worlds fifth-largest economy could be hit by 20-40 basis points in the current fiscal year. The RBI now estimates growth at 6.5, slightly lower than its earlier estimate of 6.7. It sees inflation at 4 compared to 4.2 earlier. Tariff measures announced by the U.S. have exacerbated uncertainties but quantifying the impact of this on growth is difficult, central bank Governor Sanjay Malhotra said in his statement. Growth is improving but remains lower than what we aspire for, said Malhotra, adding that the inflation outlook is benign. All six MPC members voted to cut the repo rate. The change in the policy stance means the MPC is considering only two options, either status quo or a rate cut, and the stance does not directly link to liquidity conditions, he said. Indias benchmark 10-year bond yield was marginally lower at 6.50 after the announcement, against 6.51 before the announcement, while the rupee was a tad down at 86.61 from 86.58 before the decision. The benchmark equity indexes were down around 0.3 each. We note the increasing global turmoil and its spillovers to the Indian growth slowdown will necessitate the MPC for deeper rate cuts, said Upasna Bhardwaj, chief economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank. We see scope for an additional 75-100 bps of rate cuts in the year ahead depending on the scale of global slowdown, she said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Trump administration moves to restore some terminated foreign aid programs: Report",
        "date": "April 9, 2025 11:04 am",
        "content": "President Donald Trumps administration on Tuesday moved to reinstate at least six recently canceled U.S. foreign aid programs for emergency food assistance, six sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The quick reversal of decisions made just days ago underscored the rapid-fire nature of Trumps cuts to foreign aid. That has led to programs being cut, restored then cut again, disrupting international humanitarian operations. USAID Acting Deputy Administrator Jeremy Lewin, who has previously been identified as a member of billionaire Elon Musks Department of Government Efficiency, asked staff in an internal email to reverse the terminations. He asked to restore awards to the World Food Programme in Lebanon, Syria, Somalia, Jordan, Iraq and Ecuador, five sources familiar with the matter said. The administration has also resumed four awards to the International Organization for Migration in the Pacific region, two sources familiar with the matter said. Sorry for all the back and forth on awards, Lewin said on Tuesday in the internal email seen by Reuters. There are a lot of stakeholders and we need to do better about balancing these competing interests  thats my fault and I take responsibility, he added. Reuters reported on Monday that the Trump administration had ended life-saving aid programs for more than a dozen countries including Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia and Syria, totaling over 1.3 billion. According to Stand Up For Aid, an advocacy group of current and former U.S. officials, WFP contracts canceled on Lewins orders last weekend for Lebanon, Syria, Somalia and Jordan totaled more than 463 million. Many of the terminated programs had been granted waivers by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio following an initial round of cuts to foreign aid programs. The State Department said those did not reflect a final decision. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment about restoring the awards. A DEATH SENTENCE The decision to restore some aid followed pressure from inside the administration and from Congress, two sources said. The World Food Programme said on Monday that the U.S. notified the organization it was eliminating emergency food assistance funding in 14 countries, warning: If implemented, this could amount to a death sentence for millions of people facing extreme hunger and starvation. The U.S. did not restore aid to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and to Yemen, most of which is controlled by Islamist militants of the Iran-backed Houthi movement. Washington has been the largest aid donor to both countries, which have suffered years of devastating war. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce on Tuesday told reporters that the United States had concerns that WFP funding for Yemen and Afghanistan was benefiting the Houthis and the Taliban. There were a few programs that were cut in other countries that were not meant to be cut that have been rolled back and put into place, Bruce said, adding that the administration remains committed to foreign aid. Among the cuts over the weekend were 169.8 million for the WFP in Somalia, covering food assistance, nutrition for malnourished babies and children and humanitarian air support. In Syria, 111 million was cut from WFP food assistance. The cuts have been the latest piece of the Trump administrations drive to dismantle USAID, the main U.S. humanitarian aid agency. The administration has canceled billions of dollars in foreign aid since the Republican president began his second term on January 20 in an overhaul that officials described as marked by chaos and confusion. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Democrats on Tuesday wrote a letter to Rubio regarding plans to restructure the State Department, including by folding in USAID, which they said was unconstitutional, illegal, unjustified, damaging, and inefficient.

        "date": "April 9, 2025 12:36 pm",
        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has officially launched the National Anti-Corruption Action Plan (NACAP) 2025-2029 today, as a strategic initiative to reaffirm the countrys commitment to strengthening governance, enhancing transparency, and reinforcing the rule of law. The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC) led the development of the NACAP, supported by the technical expertise of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Sri Lanka with funding from the Government of Japan, which amounts to approximately 900,000 USD through the project, Promoting Economic Governance through Anti-Corruption Policy Support. The launch was attended by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake; Chief Justice, Murudu Fernando PC; Chairman of CIABOC, Justice Neil Iddawela; Commissioners and Director General of CIABOC; Mr. Akio ISOMATA, Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka; Ambassadors; High Commissioners and Heads of International Organizations; Secretaries; Senior government officials, and other high-level invitees. As Sri Lanka continues its journey towards becoming a cleaner, greener, and more sustainable country, addressing corruption has emerged as a key national priority. The NACAP builds on the success and lessons learned from the previous 2019-2023 Action Plan aiming to provide a comprehensive roadmap for combating corruption at all levels of governance, a statement said. Developed through extensive consultations with national and provincial stakeholders, the plan incorporates international best practices while aligning with the countrys constitutional and legal frameworks. The launch of this Action Plan comes in the wake of Sri Lankas enactment of the Anti-Corruption Act No. 09 of 2023, a significant milestone in the countrys fight against corruption. The new plan focuses on fostering a Whole-of-Government and Whole-of-Society approach, emphasizing the need for inclusive and strategic action to address corruptions far-reaching effects on economic stability and public trust. Key Focus Areas of the National Action Plan include; Strengthening national legal and policy frameworks to combat bribery and corruption; Enhancing inter-agency cooperation to improve coordination among key anti-corruption institutions; Improving the quality and efficiency of investigations and prosecutions of financial crimes; Implementing preventive measures, institutional strengthening, education, and legal reforms across all sectors; and encouraging public engagement in promoting integrity and accountability. Commenting on CIABOCs leadership, Mr. R.S.A. Dissanayake, Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) stated, Combating corruption requires more than just punitive measures. It is a deeply embedded cultural issue that demands a comprehensive shift in valuesbeginning with instilling integrity from early childhood. Accountability must be coupled with robust prevention mechanisms and support for witnesses who come forward with allegations. As part of our commitment to systemic reform, we are establishing an Internal Affairs Unit (IAU) within government institutions to ensure transparency and proactive oversight. Highlighting the Government of Japans commitment to support the people of Sri Lanka, H.E Akio ISOMATA, Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka stated Transparency and good governance are fundamental pillars for sustainable economic development. For Sri Lanka to attract foreign investment and achieve a long-term growth, the elimination of corruption is indispensable. The effective implementation and continuous follow-up of the NAP are essential to the success. I would like to see all the relevant authorities, including politicians and government officials, work to translate this Plan into concrete action and to ensure accountability at all levels of governance. The Action Plan is structured around four broad strategic pillarsPreventive Measures, Institutional Strengthening  Enforcement, Education, and Law  Policy Reformcovering nine priority areas essential for an effective national anti-corruption strategy. It provides a detailed implementation timeline, with short-term, medium-term, and long-term objectives to ensure sustained progress. Highlighting UNDPs role, Ms. Azusa Kubota, Resident Representative, UNDP in Sri Lanka stated, The National Anti-Corruption Action Plan is a roadmap for transformation across Sri Lankan society. When implemented in full, it will make corruption visible through structured, inclusive, and results-driven mechanisms. UNDP has been a steadfast technical partner in Sri Lankas anti-corruption efforts, from the first NAP in 2019-2023 and the Anti-Corruption Act of 2023. With a view to strengthening overall economic governance, we are committed to working with a wide range of stakeholders, including CIABOC, the judiciary, revenue collection agencies, independent commissions, the Parliament and citizens. The successful implementation of this Action Plan will require a collective effort from the government, civil society, private sector, and the public. As Sri Lanka strives to improve its global standing in anti-corruption measures, this initiative marks a significant step toward restoring public trust and ensuring a fair and just governance system for future generations, the statement added.",

        "date": "April 9, 2025 01:14 pm",
        "content": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday (Apr 8) said the United States will soon announce a major tariff on pharmaceutical imports. Speaking at an event at the National Republican Congressional Committee, Trump said the tariff will incentivise drug companies to move their operations to the US. Pharmaceuticals were exempt from sweeping tariffs on US imports announced by Trump last week but he has said they will face separate tariffs. European pharma companies, fearful of the tariff fallout, warned the European Commission at a meeting on Tuesday Trumps tariffs would expedite the industrys shift away from Europe and toward the US. Pharma trade lobby EFPIA, whose members include European pharma giants Bayer, Novartis and Novo Nordisk, said it had called on EU President Ursula von der Leyen to push for rapid and radical action to mitigate the risk of exodus to the US. EFPIA said the EU needs to change its regulatory framework for the industry to make it more conducive to innovation and strengthen Europes intellectual property provisions. The demands were not new. EFPIA has repeatedly warned that Europes pharma sector will lose out to increased competition from the US, China and emerging markets if the EU does not amend a proposed revamp of laws governing the sector. Now with the uncertainty created by the threat of tariffs, there is little incentive to invest in the EU and significant drivers to relocate to the US, the EFPIA statement read. A statement from the commission said Novo Nordisk, Novartis, Fresenius, Sanofi, Bayer, Gedeon Richter and Ipsen Chiesi attended the call. Further, the statement said the industry raised strong concerns about the wider impact of US tariffs on global supply chains and medicine availabilities in Europe as well as regulatory barriers within the EU. The industry also pushed for simpler procedures for clinical trials and digitalisation of the European health system, as well as for protection of intellectual property. They urged ambition and speed with upcoming initiatives ... notably the EU Biotech Act, the statement added. Biotech lobby Europabio, the European Confederation of Pharmaceutical Entrepreneurs and generics trade group Medicines for Europe also attended the meeting. Europe and the US have interconnected supply chains for medicines. The US depends on medicines partly produced in Europe that bring in hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue. EU medical and pharmaceutical product exports to the US totalled about 90 billion euros (US97.05 billion) in 2023, according to the latest Eurostat data. European pharma giants have recently been expanding production facilities in the US. The US is the biggest pharma market by sales for big pharma companies, both US and European headquartered ones. Sales in North America accounted for nearly 50 per cent of world pharmaceutical sales in 2021, compared with nearly 25 per cent for Europe, according to EFPIA. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "April 9, 2025 01:39 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas economy is projected to grow by 3.9 in the current fiscal year, according to the Asian Development Bank. The ADB said Sri Lankas growth exceeded expectations, rebounding by 5.0 in 2024, the highest rate since 2017, after 2.3 contraction in 2023. Sri Lankas recovery will continue at a moderate growth of 3.9 in 2025 and 3.4 in 2026 following the strong rebound in 2024, the ADBs flagship economic publication, the Asian Development Outlook (ADO) April 2025 has indicated. It cautioned that although Sri Lankas growth recovery exceeded expectations in 2024 it remains fragile. The ADB noted that inflation has been in negative territory since September 2024 due to steep utility price cuts. Following a steep decline from 17.4 to 1.2  in 2024, inflation is expected to rise to 3.1 in 2025 and 4.5 in 2026, driven by higher demand from the ongoing recovery, higher electricity tariffs, and currency depreciation. It added, Inflation decelerated significantly in 2024 following major cuts in energy prices. Credit to the private sector picked up, reserves continued to build up, while tourism and remittances inflows remained strong. ADB expects recovery to continue in 2025 and 2026. Meanwhile, growth in the South Asian region is expected to rise from 5.8 in 2024 to 6.0 in 2025 and 6.2 in 2026. The growth forecasts were finalized prior to the 2 April announcement of new tariffs by the US administration, so the baseline projections only reflect tariffs that were in place previously. However, ADO April 2025 does feature an analysis of how higher tariffs may affect growth in Asia and the Pacific.",

        "date": "April 9, 2025 02:55 pm",
        "content": "A detailed analysis of a full-sized digital scan of the Titanic has revealed new insight into the doomed liners final hours. The exact 3D replica shows the violence of how the ship ripped in two as it sank after hitting an iceberg in 1912 - 1,500 people lost their lives in the disaster. The scan provides a new view of a boiler room, confirming eye-witness accounts that engineers worked right to the end to keep the ships lights on. And a computer simulation also suggests that punctures in the hull the size of A4 pieces of paper led to the ships demise. Titanic is the last surviving eyewitness to the disaster, and she still has stories to tell, said Parks Stephenson, a Titanic analyst. The scan has been studied for a new documentary by National Geographic and Atlantic Productions called Titanic: The Digital Resurrection. The wreck, which lies 3,800m down in the icy waters of the Atlantic, was mapped using underwater robots. More than 700,000 images, taken from every angle, were used to create the digital twin, which was revealed exclusively to the world by BBC News in 2023. Because the wreck is so large and lies in the gloom of the deep, exploring it with submersibles only shows tantalising snapshots. The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic. The immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage. But sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half. The new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship. Its like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is, said Parks Stephenson. And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here. The scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some peoples cabins during the collision. Experts have been studying one of the Titanics huge boiler rooms - its easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two. Passengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves. The digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water. Lying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system. This would have been thanks to a team of engineers led by Joseph Bell who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces to keep the lights on. All died in the disaster but their heroic actions saved many lives, said Parks Stephenson. They kept the lights and the power working to the end, to give the crew time to launch the lifeboats safely with some light instead of in absolute darkness, he told the BBC. They held the chaos at bay as long as possible, and all of that was kind of symbolised by this open steam valve just sitting there on the stern. A new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking. It takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanics blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg. We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking, said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research. The simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull. Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded. But the simulation calculates the icebergs damage was spread across six compartments. The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper, said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle. But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks. Unfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment. The human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible. Personal possessions from the ships passengers are scattered across the sea floor. The scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica. Shes only giving her stories to us a little bit at a time, said Parks Stephenson. Every time, she leaves us wanting for more. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "April 9, 2025 06:48 pm",
        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake emphasized that since assuming office, the current government has taken decisive steps to free the process of combating bribery and corruption from political interference. He emphasised that while the political mechanism has been liberated from engaging in such crimes, it is now the responsibility of the administrative machinery operating beneath that political structure to fall in line and correct its course without delay. He explained that a grace period of six months has already been provided for the state officials to adjust to this new direction. The President firmly warned that if the public service mechanism fails to act appropriately within this period, the government will not hesitate to take firm legal action against those officials from May onwards. President Dissanayake expressed these views today (09), participating in the launch of the National Anti-Corruption Action Plan 20252029, held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) in Colombo, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). Bribery and corruption have proliferated, undermining the integrity and values of the countrys state institutions, the President said. He observed that over the past six months of the present government, no section of the public service has been allowed to collapse and that if officials continue to resist change, the government will proceed to remove and replace them after May. The President pointed out that bribery and corruption have caused the nation to fall behind for decades in the eyes of the world. He reiterated that enforcing the law against these crimes is not an act of political revenge but a profound human responsibility. The President stressed the need to build a society that respects the law and fears wrongdoing, adding that conducting lectures or workshops alone would not suffice in achieving this goal. He emphasised that people must practically witness that any person who commits a crime will be subjected to punishment under the law. President Dissanayake noted that corruption in Sri Lanka ranges from minor bribery, from the village level to bringing poor quality medicinal drugs. Bribery and corruption have escalated from minor instances to grave financial crimes, extending from local councils to looting the Central Bank. The President further said that previous rulers safeguarded and protected those engaged in corrupt activities. He also revealed the emergence of a network of thieves within several state administrative institutions and certain bodies responsible for enforcing the law, comprising underworld elements involved in bribery and corruption. He confirmed that these criminal networks have already been identified and assured that measures will be implemented in the future to dismantle and eliminate them. President Dissanayake solemnly pledged that the responsibility of eradicating bribery and corruption will not be passed on to the next generation but will be resolved within this generation itself, under the leadership of the present government. Drawing a comparison with India, which gained independence a year before Sri Lanka, the President noted that through a consistent national policy framework, India has successfully achieved space exploration and built a massive workforce in the software industry. In stark contrast, he pointed out that Sri Lanka, due to poor decisions made by its political leadership, was declared a bankrupt state in 2022. He further stated that the current government has taken on the responsibility of leading Sri Lanka towards the international stage through a national policy framework that ensures transparency and accountability for every rupee spent from public funds. The President added that by implementing this framework, it is possible to build public trust in law enforcement and judicial institutions and that it must be made clear to the people that there will be no mechanism available for anyone to escape the law after committing a crime. He stated that the purpose of the National Anti-Corruption Action Plan 2025-2029 is to guide the country towards becoming a nation of integrity. The government plans to establish Internal Affairs Unit within all state institutions including the Presidential Secretariat and implement a system for monitoring these units through digital technology to ensure accountability and transparency. The Action Plan has been designed around four key strategic priority areas: prevention and public participation, institutional strengthening and the enforcement of law along with reforms in law and policy. The President highlighted that eliminating bribery and corruption is one of the most decisive factors in a countrys development and progress. In Sri Lanka, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) has been identified as the leading state institution entrusted with strengthening this mechanism. Accordingly, it was recognised that a robust national anti-corruption policy that operates across all sectors is essential to creating a corruption-free society. In preparing this Action Plan, CIABOC engaged all relevant stakeholders by conducting extensive programmes at both national and provincial levels. A broad public consultation process was carried out, including a comprehensive survey to assess public opinion on corruption through media announcements in all three languages and via social media networks, the statement said. This process gathered proposals from a diverse range of participants, including Members of Parliament, judges, state officials, the private sector, international organisations, civil society organisations, community-based organisations, religious groups, persons with special needs, media professionals, youth, children and the general public. Additionally, foreign state experiences and suggestions from various groups across all provinces were taken into consideration when formulating the Action Plan. By implementing this National Anti-Corruption Action Plan, the government hopes to foster a committed citizenry determined to combat corruption, a political will fully supportive of this effort, a comprehensive legal framework and a disciplined, transparent public service across all sectors, with the shared vision of building a country of integrity for future generations. Addressing the event, the Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Hideaki Mizukoshi, stated that Corruption remains a great challenge for many countries, including Sri Lanka as it undermines economic growth, weakens public trust in government institutions and discourages foreign investment. However, he noted that due to the reform initiatives of the present government, investors are once again showing increasing interest in Sri Lanka. Ambassador Mizukoshi further stated that Japan has always believed that transparency and good governance are fundamental pillars for sustainable economic development and therefore, has supported anti-corruption initiatives globally for over a decade. Meanwhile, the UNDP Resident Representative in Sri Lanka, Ms. Azusa Kubota, stated that according to Sri Lankas first-ever National Taxpayer Perception Survey conducted last year, 84 of respondents indicated that corruption directly affects their willingness to pay taxes. She further noted that corruption deters investment, increases the cost of doing business, undermines sustainable development and human security, and causes an estimated annual loss of USD 1.3 trillion for developing countries. Referring to the Budget Speech delivered by the President, Ms. Kubota emphasised that the State must be accountable for every cent of taxpayers money and stated that this Action Plan would serve as a roadmap for transforming Sri Lankan society. The event was attended by the Chief Justice, Supreme Court Justice Murdu Fernando; the Attorney General, Parinda Ranasinghe PC; the Secretary to the President, Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake; the Chairman of CIABOC, former High Court Judge Neil Iddawela; the Director General of CIABOC, R.S.A. Dissanayake; the Commanders of the Tri-Forces; the Inspector General of Police; senior officials from the security forces and a large number of state officials. --PMD",

        "date": "April 9, 2025 09:50 pm",
        "content": "Ukraines claim that significant numbers of Chinese nationals are fighting for Russias invading army is totally unfounded, a Beijing official said Wednesday, as the U.S. strives to secure a ceasefire in the more than three-year war. Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced Tuesday that the Ukrainian military had captured two Chinese men fighting alongside the Russian army on Ukrainian soil and had information that significantly more are with Russian forces. It was the first time Ukraine had made such a claim about Chinese fighters in the war. China has provided strong diplomatic support for Russia since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022. Beijing has also offered an economic lifeline through the trade in energy and consumer goods, but is not believed to have knowingly provided Russia with troops, weapons or military expertise. U.S. officials have accused Iran of providing Russia with drones, while American and South Korean officials say North Korea has sent thousands of troops and ammunition to help Russia on the battlefield. With the U.S. and Europe having provided substantial military support and diplomatic heft for Ukraine, the war has to some degree become a contest between power blocs. Tensions between the U.S. and China have deepened in recent years. Disputes have centered on geopolitical influence, technology and trade  and recently escalating import tariffs between the countries have roiled global financial markets. U.S. President Donald Trump is trying to follow through on a campaign promise last year to swiftly end the war in Ukraine. U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said at a briefing in Washington on Tuesday that reports of Chinese citizens fighting on behalf of Russia were disturbing. China is a major enabler of Russia in the war in Ukraine, Bruce said. China provides nearly 80 of the dual-use items Russia needs to sustain the war, she claimed. The Kremlin has effectively rejected a U.S. proposal for an immediate and full 30-day halt in the fighting in Ukraine. The Kyiv government has consented to it. Both sides are believed to be readying spring-summer military campaigns. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said in Beijing that China has played a constructive role in politically resolving the Ukraine crisis. Lin told a daily news briefing Wednesday that the Chinese government always asks Chinese citizens to stay away from conflict zones, avoid getting involved in any form of armed conflict, and especially refrain from participating in any partys military operations. His comments appeared to indicate that the captured Chinese had joined Russias ranks on their own initiative. Both Russia and Ukraine allow foreign soldiers to enlist. China has previously put forward a vague peace plan that was swiftly dismissed by most observers. In the meantime, both countries have kept fighting a war of attrition along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line and targeted each other with long-range strikes. The city of Kramatorsk in Ukraines eastern Donetsk endured a massive drone attack overnight, regional head Vadym Filashkin said, injuring an 11-year-old girl, her mother and her grandmother. Ukraines air force said Russia launched 55 Shahed and decoy drones at the country overnight. The Russian Defense Ministry said that air defenses downed 158 Ukrainian drones over 11 Russian regions overnight but reported no casualties or damage. Several Russian regions temporarily suspended flights at their airports because of the attack, however, and some Ukrainian drones reached Russias Orenburg region in the southern Urals located nearly 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) east of the Ukrainian border, the Defense Ministry said.

        "content": "Health officials urge the public to remain vigilant and seek immediate medical attention if they experience symptoms linked to mosquito-borne diseases, as cases of Chikungunya, dengue, and malaria are back on the rise in Sri Lanka. Officials warn that the global spread of Chikungunya  now reported in over 115 countries  is also being observed locally. So far, 190 suspected cases have been reported in Sri Lanka, of which 65 have been clinically confirmed. The highest number of cases has been recorded from the Western Province. Medical professionals stress that with the current increase in mosquito populations, proactive measures are essential to control the spread. They recommend eliminating mosquito breeding grounds as a key step in prevention. Meanwhile, health authorities are also battling a resurgence of dengue. At the Ratnapura Teaching Hospital, 87 individuals, including 37 staff members, are currently being treated for the disease. In response, urgent cleaning operations are reportedly underway at the hospital premises and surrounding areas. In a separate development, a confirmed case of malaria has been detected at the Horana District Hospital. The patient, a resident of Ellakanda in Horana, had recently returned to the country from overseas. According to the Kalutara Malaria Control Unit, while no primary vector mosquitoes were found in the area, secondary vector species were detected. The Health Entomology Division has since launched an awareness campaign in the neighborhood, educating residents and distributing mosquito nets as a preventive measure. Although Sri Lanka was declared malaria-free in 2016, the National Malaria Control Campaign has reported 14 cases so far this year  all involving Sri Lankans returning from abroad.",

Speaking at a government media conference on Wednesday (09), the Deputy Minister said Sri Lanka is focusing on attracting up-market tourists to the island, whose spending power will not be greatly affected by the tariffs. Commenting further, the Deputy Minister expressed: In the long term we need to consider how long US will go on with these tariffs. Considering tourism, Sri Lankas emerging market is India. We have designed a campaign now. We will start that very soon targeting the top market of India. We are planning not to continue mainly focusing on numbers, but the revenue per tourist. So, 3 million to 4 million tourists could be fine as long as we could enhance the revenue earned per tourist. Prof. Ranasinghe also noted that there will be an impact over the disposable income of individuals followed by these tariffs imposed, adding that still the top market category will be fine. We are gradually looking at it, while improving and developing the tourism product of the country, to reach to the up markets, he added. The Deputy Minister of tourism also commented on the increasing investments towards Sri Lankas tourism sector, stating, There is a clear increase in terms of investments to the tourism sector. In 2024, we have received nearly USD 40 million in investments to the sector. If you take last three months, we have secured nearly USD 25 million so far.",

        "date": "April 10, 2025 10:05 am",
        "content": "Decades ago, passengers could travel from Chennai (then Madras) to Colombo, Sri Lanka, by train and ferry. The journey began at Egmore station and continued along the eastern coast, crossing the iconic Pamban Bridge to reach Rameswaram. From there, trains ran to Dhanushkodi, the southernmost rail point in India. A short ferry ride across the Palk Strait took travellers to Talaimannar in Sri Lanka, where they could board a train to Colombo. This seamless route was disrupted in 1964, when a powerful cyclone devastated coastal Tamil Nadu. The storm, with wind speeds over 150 kmph, damaged the Pamban Rail Bridge and wiped out the railway line between Rameswaram and Dhanushkodi. Since then, trains have terminated at Rameswaram, and the ferry link to Sri Lanka has not resumed, as per a report by India Today. Sixty years on, a new bridge may breathe life into that lost connection. On 6 April 2025, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a newly built Pamban Bridge, replacing the 110-year-old structure. The launch has revived hopes for a larger plana direct rail link between India and Sri Lanka. The idea isnt new. During British rule, a proposal was made to connect the two countries by rail, as part of a broader plan to move goods and people efficiently across the empire. In 1914, the South Indian Railway built the Pamban Bridge, enabling trains to reach Dhanushkodi. But the last segmentlinking Dhanushkodi to Talaimannarwas never completed due to financial constraints and later global events like World War I. Until the 1964 cyclone, a popular service called the Indo-Ceylon Boat Mail allowed passengers to travel from Chennai to Colombo through a combination of train and ferry. The cyclone not only halted this unique journey but also buried the vision of direct rail connectivity between the two nations. In recent years, discussions around this long-standing idea have resurfaced. A road-and-rail bridge or undersea tunnel across the Palk Straitfrom Dhanushkodi to Talaimannar, just 25 km aparthas been considered. Multiple feasibility studies have been conducted. The success of the new Pamban Bridge could serve as a stepping stone to extending the rail line further. In 2002, Sri Lanka proposed a road-cum-rail bridge linking Rameswaram and Talaimannar, but the plan was shelved due to opposition from Tamil Nadus then-Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa, who raised security concerns. Though the political climate has shifted, questions of security and cost remain. In 2015, Indias Union Minister Nitin Gadkari pitched the project to the Asian Development Bank, which agreed to fund it. But Sri Lankas transport minister later dismissed the proposal. Fresh interest in the idea emerged in 2024. Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that a feasibility study on the project was nearing completion. A Sri Lankan official also suggested that India might fund the entire 5 billion project, although this was later downplayed by another minister. Meanwhile, India has deepened its role in upgrading Sri Lankas rail infrastructure. During PM Modis recent visit, he and Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake inaugurated two India-assisted railway projects. India has also built and upgraded several other rail lines in the island nation. Sri Lanka is the only neighbouring country that India does not share a rail link with. Existing links connect India to Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh, with plans for Bhutan in progress. Establishing a link with Sri Lanka could enhance trade, tourism, and cultural exchange, especially as both countries already share a Free Trade Agreement. With growing focus on infrastructure, political realignment in Tamil Nadu, and renewed interest in regional connectivity, the dream of bridging the 25-kilometre gap between Dhanushkodi and Talaimannar might just move from paper to tracks.

Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya further stated: The government is committed to delivering the justice to those who have been affected by the issue of disappearances. However, we cannot conduct these investigations on a personal basis and such matters must be addressed legally and institutionally. The institutional and systemic failures in the past years mainly caused the delays in these matters. Therefore, such issues are needed to be addressed. This is not about gaining popularity, instead it is necessary to establish institutions and environment to ensure that such incidents do not recur, while addressing the existing injustices. The public has lost their trust in the Office for Reparations and the Office on Missing Persons because they were merely established in name and lacked adequate strength and were largely ineffective. This is what happened in the past, and that is what expected to be corrected. Hence, it must be ensured that the right individuals are placed in positions, that sufficient resources are allocated, and that the institutions are capable of fulfilling their responsibilities. There are still pending legal disputes related to the missing persons. Some of these cases have been under disputed for the past 16 years. It is not an easy task, but the government is committed to ensuring justice.

Under the new circumstances, China stands ready to join hands with Australia and the international community to jointly respond to the changes of the world, Xiao said. U.S. President Donald Trump, in a stunning reversal, on Wednesday said he would temporarily lower hefty duties on dozens of countries but continue to target China, raising the tariff to 125 from 104, further escalating a trade war between the worlds two largest economies. That could pose a risk to Australia, which ships almost a third of its goods to China. Exports to the United States are less than 5 of Australias total goods exports. Australias central bank has warned the ongoing uncertainty over tariffs and other trade restrictions between the U.S. and other major economies could have a chilling effect on business investment and household spending decisions in the country. Trump has imposed a unilateral 10 tariff on Australia, the low end of his reciprocal tariffs for all imports into the United States. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said that while the duty on Australia, a key U.S. security ally in the Indo-Pacific, has no basis in logic, his government would not retaliate.

        "title": "LeBron James becomes first male athlete with a Ken doll",
        "date": "April 10, 2025 12:28 pm",
        "content": "LeBron James, one of the most iconic figures in modern sports, has made history once again - this time in the toy aisle. Mattel has announced the release of a new Barbie in Mr James likeness, making him the first professional male athlete to be honoured as a Ken doll. We are excited to bring fans a new presentation of Ken, said Krista Berger, Mattels senior vice president of Barbie. She said the doll celebrates LeBron as a role model, his ability as an icon to transcend culture and set a positive example for the next generation. The doll features the Los Angeles Lakers basketball player in his pre-game fashion and reflects his height - its an inch taller than the standard Ken doll. In reality, the athlete is 6ft 9in tall. The new doll comes as the company is facing financial uncertainty amid President Donald Trumps escalating trade war with China, where just under 40 of Mattels production is based. Trump announced on Wednesday that tariffs on goods from China would increase to 125. He accused Beijing of a lack of respect after it retaliated and said it would impose tariffs of 84 on US imports. In the same announcement, Trump announced a 90-day pause for countries hit by higher US tariffs and authorised a universal lowered reciprocal tariff of 10 as negotiations continued with roughly 60 countries. Mattel has said it may have to increase prices and possibly implement changes to its supply chain. Consumer and business groups in the US have warned that the tariffs may disrupt supply chains and lead to higher prices. The new Ken doll doesnt show the athlete in his basketball uniform. Instead, hes dressed in a varsity jacket adorned with LJ on the front. It includes an Ohio patch and a crown patch on one sleeve and the number 23 - his basketball jersey number - on the other. On the back, LeBron is boldly printed along with the phrase, Just a kid from Akron - the Ohio city where he was born. Under the jacket, the doll wears a shirt that reads We Are Family, a nod to the stars foundation. The doll includes accessories like a basketball, headphones and sneakers. In a promotional video released by Mattel, Mr James reacted to see the doll for the first time. Oh, he dope! he says as hes given the figurine. Thats so cool! As he toyed with the dolls accessories, he joked the LeBron Ken doll might have to do a little lifting, legs are looking skinny. The move is a significant moment for the 65-year-old Barbie brand, which has made a push in recent years to diversify its dolls and reflect a broader range of careers, body types and backgrounds. Though Barbie has previously honoured athletes like Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka, and Megan Rapinoe, Mr James is the first male sports figure - and the first male figure not from the entertainment industry - to join the lineup. Even with four NBA titles, two Olympic gold medals, and a scoring record to his name, Mr James says his new title of Kenbassador hits differentlybecause its about more than basketball. Its an opportunity to recognize the powerful impact of role models who instill confidence, inspire dreams, and show kids that they, too, can achieve greatness. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "Meta whistleblower alleges company worked with China on censorship",
        "date": "April 10, 2025 12:34 pm",
        "content": "A Meta whistleblower told US senators on Wednesday that the company undermined national security in order to build a 18 billion business in China. At a congressional hearing, Sarah Wynn-Williams, a former global public policy director at Facebook, said she watched as executives decided to provide the Chinese Communist Party with access to the data of Meta users, including that of Americans. Meta has disputed Ms Wynn-Williamss statements. Sarah Wynn-Williams testimony is divorced from reality and riddled with false claims, said Meta spokesman Ryan Daniels. Mr Daniels said CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been public about the companys interest in offering its services in China, but added. The fact is this: we do not operate our services in China today. Meta does, however, generate advertising revenue from advertisers based in China. During her testimony before a Senate judiciary subcommittee, Ms Wynn-Williams also alleged the parent company of Facebook and Instagram worked hand in glove with Beijing to build censorship tools aimed at silencing critics of the Chinese Community Party. Specifically, she said Meta capitulated to Chinas demands that it delete the Facebook account of Guo Wengui, a Chinese dissident living in the US. Meta maintains it unpublished Mr Guos page and suspended his profile because it violated the companys Community Standards. One thing the Chinese Communist Party and Mark Zuckerberg share is that they want to silence their critics. I can say that from personal experience, Ms Wynn-Williams said during her testimony. In March, Ms Wynn-Williams released a memoir called Careless People about her experience at the company, which was then called Facebook. Meta won an emergency ruling in the US that temporarily blocked her from promoting her book, which included several critical claims about her time at the company. The false and defamatory book should never have been published, Meta said at the time. Wednesdays hearing before members of the US Senate was led by Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri. Sen Hawley opened the hearing by saying Meta had stopped at absolutely nothing to prevent Wednesdays testimony by Ms Wynn-Williams, who joins Frances Haugen and Arturo Béjar as former employees who have spoken out against the social media giant. Why is it that Facebook is so desperate to prevent this witness from telling what she knows? Hawley said. At a fiery January 2024 congressional hearing at which Mr Zuckerberg also testified, Sen Hawley demanded that the CEO apologise to families who said their children had been harmed by social media. Behind Mr Zuckerberg at the 2024 hearing sat a row of families who said their children had self-harmed or killed themselves as a result of social media content. Mr Zuckerberg turned and told families in the audience that no one should go through what they had. During Wednesdays hearing, Sen Hawley said Meta had suggested Ms Wynn-Williams could face financial penalties for speaking out. They have threatened her with 50,000 in punitive damages every time she mentions Facebook in public, even if the statements that she is making are true, Sen Hawley alleged. Even as we sit here today, Facebook is attempting her total and complete financial ruin. On Wednesday, the company told the BBC the 50,000 in damages is for each material violation of the separation agreement that she signed when she departed the company in 2017. Ms Wynn-Williams says Meta told her that creating exceptions to the non-disparagement agreement would eat the rule, which Meta later clarified to the BBC was the comment of an arbitrator, not the company. The company added that she was not restricted from testifying before Congress. But Meta declined to directly respond to a BBC inquiry about whether Ms Wynn- Williams may indeed face financial penalties initiated by the company or its lawyers for statements she made on Wednesday in front of Congress. Ms Wynn-Williams told lawmakers that all of this had taken a personal toll on her. The last four weeks have been very difficult, she told members of the Senate committee. Even the choice to come and speak to Congress is incredibly difficult. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "Chairman of the Board of Investment (BOI) Arjuna Hearth has invited all top 50 exporters of the BOI in key industries to open dialogue to seek alternative strategies to mitigate the consequences due to the new US tariff imposed on Sri Lanka. Senior advisor to the president Duminda Hulnagamuwa also participated and explained what government initiatives have been taken so far to achieve positive outcomes and stage the negotiations. The diplomatic-level discussion has already taken place, and our diplomatic officers in Washington, DC, have already established communication with the respective trade delegates at the White Houses trade department. Almost 70 countries have already reached out to the US to seek individual consultations from the US government on specific tariffs to reach a further consensus. There is a diverse range of Sri Lankan businesses that export to the United States, and around 200 of these are BOI enterprises. In 2024, the U.S. goods trade deficit with Sri Lanka was approximately 2.6 billion, with U.S. goods imports from Sri Lanka totaling 3.0 billion and exports to Sri Lanka at 368.2 million. The representatives from the apparel industry, rubber industry, food industry, and ornament industry also participated in the discussion. We extensively discussed the differential tariffs of competitive countries in Sri Lanka and their impact on each sector. The very recent 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs has had a positive impact and resumed most of the customers orders, yet industries are looking beyond the 90 days and alternatives to secure their business. During the discussion, it was highlighted that most countries are seeking alternative trade agreements and new market opportunities to mitigate the USs impact on specific economies and seek further trade relationships. These developments encourage Sri Lankan industries to explore partnerships with emerging markets and diversify their supply chains. By fostering collaborations with countries outside the traditional trading powers, they can enhance their resilience and adaptability in an ever-changing global landscape.",

        "content": "A devastating roof collapse at a popular nightclub in the capital of the Dominican Republic has claimed at least 184 lives, authorities said late on Wednesday, as the search for survivors turned increasingly grim. The nightclub collapsed on Tuesday and for two days families have gathered outside the wreckage of the Jet Set club in Santo Domingo, anxious for information about their missing relatives and sharing photos with police. We are not going to abandon nobody, Juan Manuel Mendez, head of the countrys emergency operations center, said at a press conference. Emergency crews will continue to work until the last body will be found, but hopes of finding more survivors under the rubble were diminishing while no one had been pulled out alive in more than 24 hours, Mendez added. In the coming hours there will be a transition from a search and rescue phase to the recovery of the bodies phase, presidential spokesperson Homero Figueroa said in a statement. Families continued to hold out hope. Along with dozens of others, Alex de Leon was looking for his ex-wife, mother of their two children, and a close mutual friend at the area surrounding the nightclub. Unfortunately I dont have any information about where they are, he said. My 15 year-old son is devastated, and the little one who is 9 remains calm because weve told him that his mom is at work. Relatives and friends of people who are still missing held their photos and described the clothes they were wearing when the tragedy struck, hoping that it will help identify their loved ones if they were disfigured. Earlier on Wednesday authorities reported that 155 people had been rescued from the rubble and transferred to hospitals. The exact number of people inside the club at the time of the collapse remained unclear. From Celebration to Tragedy The tragedy unfolded during a concert by popular Dominican singer Rubby Perez. The event, which had drawn politicians, athletes and other prominent figures, turned into a nightmare after midnight as the roof suddenly collapsed. Perez was one of the victims and the Ministry of Culture announced it will hold a tribute on Thursday to honor his memory as one of the great figures of the countrys art and the merengue scene. The families of the victims whose bodies have already been recovered have begun to hold their funerals. President Luis Abinader attended the funeral ceremony on Wednesday of Nelsy Cruz, governor of the northern Monte Cristi province and sister of former MLB player Nelson Cruz, a seven-time All-Star. We are left to mourn her and the other victims, Abinader said during the service. Pitcher Octavio Dotel and slugger Tony Blanco, both former Major League Baseball players, were also killed. The son of the public works and communications minister also died in the disaster. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Accordingly, he was granted bail under two sureties of Rs.1 million each, Ada Derana reported said. Tennakoon was previously remanded until today, after he surrendered to the court on March 19. After an arrest warrant was issued in connection with a shooting incident near a hotel in the Pelena area of Weligama in December 2023, he surrendered to the court by submitting a motion after absconding for nearly 20 days. Following his surrender, the Matara Magistrate ordered that the suspect be remanded until today. The Matara Magistrates Court had previously issued an arrest order for eight police officers, including former officers of the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) and IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon, naming them as suspects in the shooting incident that occurred in front of the W15 Hotel in the Pelena area of Weligama, Matara, on December 31, 2023. Following this, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) was instructed to arrest and present the eight individuals, including Deshabandu Tennakoon, before the court. On March 17, the Court of Appeal dismissed the writ petition filed by Tennakoon, in which he sought an interim injunction to prevent the execution of the arrest order issued by the Matara Magistrates Court in connection with the shooting incident. The Court of Appeal subsequently directed the CID to take immediate steps to arrest Tennakoon and present him before the court. Meanwhile, a resolution to appoint a committee of inquiry for the removal of Deshabandu Tennakoon from his position as Inspector General of Police (IGP) due to alleged misconduct and abuse of power, was passed in Parliament on Tuesday.",

The COPE recently (2025.04.02) reviewed the Bandaranaike International Airport Development Project in connection with the Auditor Generals Reports for the years 2022 and 2023 and the current performance of the Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) (Private) Limited (AASL), and accordingly conducted this field investigation, the Department of Communication of Parliament said in a statement. It was expected that the number of aircraft stands at Bandaranaike International Airport would be increased through the construction of a Remote Apron and Taxiways as part of the Bandaranaike International Airport Development Project. However, it was observed that both the AASL and the Japanese joint venture company hired for design and consultancy services had undertaken these activities without proper technical or operational analysis. As a result, achieving the projects objectives proved challenging, according to the statement. Despite several weaknesses and practical challenges identified at the planning stage, the Committee noted that steps were taken to complete the project. Accordingly, the solutions already proposed by AASL to achieve the desired objectives of the project were also observed. The COPE members held extensive discussions with local representatives from the Japanese joint venture and senior officials from relevant institutions. During these discussions, the Committee expressed displeasure over the financial losses incurred by the government due to these oversight issues and poor planning. The Committee recommended that, to prevent further misuse of public funds in future development activities, attention must be given to the issues arising during planning stages, it added. The Committee decided to reconvene with the officials from AASL in the near future to continue discussions on the matter.",

        "title": "Beijing bites back at US tariffs by curbing Hollywood imports",
        "date": "April 10, 2025 09:42 pm",
        "content": "China said on Thursday it would immediately restrict imports of Hollywood films in retaliation for President Donald Trumps escalation of U.S. tariffs on imported Chinese goods, though analysts say the impact is likely to be minimal. After three decades during which China annually imported 10 Hollywood movies, its National Film Administration said Trumps increase of tariffs on Chinese imports would further sour domestic demand for U.S. cinema in China after years of decline. We will follow market rules, respect the audiences choices, and moderately reduce the number of American films imported, the NFA said on its website. Chris Fenton, author of Feeding the Dragon: Inside the Trillion Dollar Dilemma Facing Hollywood, the NBA, and American Business, said the move was a super high-profile way to make a statement of retaliation with almost zero downside for China. Hollywood studios once looked to China, and its giant film market, to help boost box office performance of movies. But domestic films increasingly have outperformed Hollywoods fare in China, with Ne Zha 2 this year eclipsing Pixars Inside Out 2 to become the highest-grossing animated film of all time, according to Variety. Now, U.S. films account for only 5 of the overall box office receipts in Chinas market. And worse for Hollywood, China taxes that small amount 50 before any revenues go back to the USA, Fenton told Reuters. SMALL BOX OFFICE TAKE Hollywood studios receive only 25 of Chinas box office whereas other markets give studios double that, he said. Such a high-profile punishment of Hollywood is an all-win motion of strength by Beijing that will surely be noticed by Washington, Fenton added. Earlier this week, two influential Chinese bloggers suggested that one response to Trumps tariffs would be to ban or restrict American movies. Some exhibitors dismissed the possibility, noting Chinas Film Bureau had given Marvels Thunderbolts an April 30 release date. The restrictions arrive before the start of the summer box office, with such major releases as Mission Impossible  The Final Reckoning, which may mark Tom Cruises last appearance in the long-running franchise, a new Superman movie from Guardians of the Galaxy filmmaker James Gunn, and Marvels new take on The Fantastic Four. Seth Shafer, principal analyst at SP Global Market Intelligence Kagan, predicted the restrictions would have limited impact. Only roughly 25 of domestic wide-release films are now released in China and that percentage has dropped steadily over time due to increasing competition from Chinas local film production industry, Shafer said. For domestic films that do get a release in China, typically less than 10 of the films global gross box office revenue comes from China. IMAX said it expects its exhibition slate, which includes Hollywood, Chinese and international films, would not be materially impacted by the newly announced restrictions. We continue to expect a strong year for IMAX in China, coming off our highest-grossing first quarter ever in the country, an IMAX spokesman said in a statement to Reuters. In 1994, China began importing 10 American films each year through the internationally recognised revenue-sharing distribution model. Imports including Titanic and Avatar became box office smashes in the Chinese market, making actors such as Leonardo DiCaprio and directors such as James Cameron household names among Chinese film lovers across generations. China is the worlds second-largest film market. However, in recent years, as local entertainment culture has bloomed, the enthusiasm of Chinese audiences for Hollywood movies has waned. Since 2020, domestic films have consistently accounted for around 80 of annual box office revenue, up from around 60 previously. On Chinas all-time box office list, only one imported film ranks in the top 20 - Avengers: Endgame, with revenue of 4.25 billion yuan (579.83 million). The remaining films in the top 20 are all domestic productions. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "EU pauses countermeasures after Trumps tariff reprieve; US weighing deals",
        "date": "April 10, 2025 09:49 pm",
        "content": "The European Union will pause its first countermeasures against U.S. tariffs after President Donald Trump temporarily lowered the hefty duties less than a day after imposing them on dozens of countries, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday. The Trump administration is weighing offers from more than a dozen countries on tariff deals and is close to reaching agreements with some of them, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said. USTR has informed us that there are maybe 15 countries now that have made explicit offers that were studying and considering and deciding whether theyre good enough to present the president, Hassett told reporters at the White House, referring to the U.S. trade representative. Principals in the administrations trade policy will meet at the White House on Thursday to discuss how to prioritize the separate negotiations, Hassett said. The EU was due to launch counter-tariffs on about 21 billion euros (23.25 billion) of U.S. imports next Tuesday in response to Trumps 25 tariffs on steel and aluminium. It is still assessing how to respond to U.S. car tariffs and the broader 10 levies that remain in place. We want to give negotiations a chance, von der Leyen said on X. While finalising the adoption of the EU countermeasures that saw strong support from our Member States, we will put them on hold for 90 days. Trumps sudden decision on Wednesday to pause most of his hefty new duties brought relief to battered markets and anxious global leaders, even as he ratcheted up a trade war with China. His turnabout, which came less than 24 hours after steep new tariffs kicked in, followed the most intense episode of financial market volatility since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. stock indexes shot higher on the news, and the relief continued into Asian and European trading on Thursday. Before Trumps U-turn, the upheaval had erased trillions of dollars from stock markets and led to an unsettling surge in U.S. government bond yields that appeared to catch Trumps attention. Trump kept the pressure on China, the worlds No. 2 economy and second-biggest provider of U.S. imports, with an increase of tariffs on Chinese imports to 125 from the 104 level that kicked in on Wednesday. He also signed an executive order aimed at reducing Chinas grip on the global shipping industry and at reviving U.S. shipbuilding. TRADE WAR WITH CHINA China rejected what it called threats and blackmail from Washington. China will follow through to the end if the U.S. persists, Commerce Ministry spokesperson He Yongqian told a regular press briefing. Chinas door was open to dialogue, but this must be based on mutual respect, the ministry said. Beijing may again respond in kind after already imposing 84 tariffs on U.S. imports on Wednesday to match Trumps earlier salvo. Trump, who claims the tariffs aim to fix U.S. trade imbalances, said a resolution with China on trade is also possible. But officials have said they will prioritize talks with other countries as Vietnam, Japan, South Korea and others line up to try and strike a bargain. Chinas yuan hit its lowest against the dollar on Thursday since the global financial crisis. EU PAUSE In Europe, euro zone government bond yields jumped, spreads tightened and markets scaled back their bets on European Central Bank rate cuts after Trumps latest announcement. European shares surged. Trumps move was an important step towards stabilising the global economy, von der Leyen said. But she warned that counter-tariffs could be reinstated if necessary. If negotiations are not satisfactory, our countermeasures will kick in. Preparatory work on further countermeasures continues, she said, before adding: As I have said before, all options remain on the table. Trumps reversal on tariffs is not absolute. A 10 blanket duty on almost all U.S. imports will remain in effect, the White House said. The announcement also does not appear to affect duties on autos, steel and aluminium. The U.S. tariff pause does not apply to duties paid by Canada and Mexico, because their goods are still subject to 25 fentanyl-related tariffs unless they comply with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreements rules of origin. India was among countries that said it wants to move quickly on a trade deal with the United States. UNCERTAINTY AND CONCERNS Oil prices retreated 2 on Thursday as fears of a deepening U.S.-China trade war and a possible recession eclipsed earlier relief created by Trumps pause announcement. Wall Street futures were indicating a lower open after Wednesdays rally. Some central bankers also remained cautious. European Central Bank policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau told France Inter radio it was less bad news than before, but ongoing uncertainty remained a threat to trust and growth. And business leaders warned that not all was resolved. The head of the French wine and spirits lobby group FEVS said Trumps decision to hit pause was half good news. Nicolas Ozanam said the move will initially allow French wine and spirits companies to resume shipments with lower tariffs, and therefore at the same level as other suppliers. But the 90-day window created logistical constraints, and given that 10 customs duties remained in place, the sector still faced inflationary pressures. This will still lead to a rise in prices and therefore a drop in consumption in the United States, he told Reuters. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Trump tariffs on China now stands at 145, White House confirms",
        "date": "April 10, 2025 10:48 pm",
        "content": "The United States has escalated its tariff war with China, as the White House confirmed Thursday that total US tariffs on Chinese imports now stands at 145 per cent, CNBC reported. The move follows a new executive order from Donald Trump raising tariffs to 125 per cent, up from 84 per cent. It also includes an additional 20 per cent tariff specifically targeting fentanyl-related imports, previously imposed on China, pushing the cumulative tariff rate up. Trump on Wednesday reversed his sweeping tariffs on most nations for at least 90 days. However, he ramped up pressure on China, on which the pause does not apply, further escalating a high-stakes confrontation between the worlds two largest economies, who have traded tit-for-tat tariff hikes repeatedly over the past week. Beijing: Door remains open, but not to threats Meanwhile, China refused to back down against Americas aggression, and its 84 per cent tariffs on US imports came into effect at 12.01 pm on Thursday, according to the Chinese state news agency, Xinhua. China has vowed to resist what it calls coercive tactics. A Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson reiterated Thursday that while Beijing remains open to dialogue, it will only negotiate on the basis of mutual respect and equality. Pressure, threats, and coercion are not the right way to deal with China, said the spokesperson, adding that Chinas response would continue to the end if provoked. In a show of defiance, Chinas foreign ministry accused the US of bullying and warned that Trumps approach would end in failure. Trade war The looming slugfest between the worlds two largest economies is casting a dark shadow over global trade, with analysts raising the spectre of an American recession. China and the United States edged dangerously close to a full-blown trade war on Tuesday after President Donald Trump announced a staggering 104 per cent tariff on all Chinese imports. Locked in an escalating showdown, neither side showed signs of backing down  with Beijing vowing to resist US pressure to the end. Trump initially imposed a 34 per cent tariff on Chinese goods, which was swiftly met with an equivalent retaliatory measure by Beijing. In response, the US added another 50 per cent in duties. When combined with earlier levies from February and March, the total tariff burden on Chinese imports under Trumps second term now stands at 104 per cent, bringing fears of a near-embargo scenario. In February, Donald Trump slapped a 10 per cent tariff on all Chinese goods with no carve-outs, citing Beijings alleged role in fuelling illegal immigration and facilitating the flow of fentanyl into the United States. Last month, he doubled those rates  a move that sent shockwaves through global markets and deepened already strained US-China relations. China, which was Americas second-largest source of imports last year, shipped 439 billion worth of goods to the US, compared to 144 billion in American exports to China. The rising tariffs now threaten to hit domestic industries hard, with businesses warning of cost surges, layoffs, and reduced competitiveness. Source: The Indian Express --Agencies",

        "date": "April 11, 2025 07:50 am",
        "content": "A familys afternoon sightseeing excursion above the misty shoreline of Manhattan ended in tragedy Thursday after the helicopter carrying them crashed off the New Jersey shoreline, killing them and the pilot. Spectators watched the helicopter as it dropped from the sky and slammed into the river upside down as fluttering debris landed in the water. The victims included Agustín Escobar, a Siemens executive, and his family, according to a law enforcement official. The family was visiting from Spain, New York Mayor Eric Adams said during a news conference Thursday. CNN has reached out to the US Coast Guard for more information on the victims. While not much is known about why the helicopter crashed, its staggering descent from the sky shocked witnesses as first responders did what they could to rescue the victims. At 3:17 p.m., multiple 911 calls reported a helicopter crash in the Hudson River near the New Jersey coastline at Pier A Park in Hoboken, New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. When first responders arrived, police pulled four people out of the water and FDNY pulled out two people, she said. Four victims were declared dead on scene and an additional two people were taken to local hospitals, Tisch said. Two children were taken to the Jersey City Medical Center before being pronounced dead, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said on X. Our hearts go out to the family of those who were on board, Adams said. President Donald Trump also sent his condolences via a Truth Social post, saying God bless the families and friends of the victims and that Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy was looking into the incident. The helicopter, operated by the tour company New York Helicopter Charter, is currently submerged in the river. The only thing I can tell you is that we are devastated, Michael Roth, the CEO of New York Helicopter Charter Inc., told CNN Thursday evening. Im a father, a grandfather and my wife hasnt stopped crying since this afternoon, he added. When asked about the maintenance of the helicopter, Roth said, Its my director of maintenance who deals with that. The companys director of maintenance declined to comment. Maintenance records are not public and the NTSB limits what companies can say publicly during an investigation. Spains Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, called the incident an unimaginable tragedy in a post on X. I share in the grief of the victims loved ones at this heartbreaking time, he said. What we know about the flight FlightRadar24 reported the aircraft to be a Bell 206L-4 LongRanger IV, based on ADS-B tracking data. It was built in 2004 and had an airworthiness certificate issued in 2016 that was good until 2029, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. There was no information immediately available on the pilot, according to Adams. The helicopter took off from the downtown Manhattan heliport at 2:59 p.m., where it flew south before turning to fly north along the Manhattan shoreline, up the Hudson River, Tisch said. At 3:08 p.m., the helicopter reached the George Washington Bridge and then turned to fly south along the New Jersey shoreline, where shortly after it lost control, she said. When the helicopter hit the water, officials believe it was inverted, leaving the cabin visible in the water, Tisch said. Reports that the helicopter stopped in mid-air and pieces of the helicopter were falling off before it hit the water is consistent with 911 reports, she said. The cause of the crash is under investigation, she said. The helicopter flew for about 16 minutes before going down into the water, according to analysis by CNN and flight tracking site FlightRadar 24. The flight path reflects much of what officials said, showing the aircraft took off from lower Manhattan and did a circle near the Statue of Liberty before flying up the Hudson River to the George Washington Bridge at about 1000 feet. At that point it turned back south, ultimately coming to rest in the water near New Jersey. The path up the Hudson is a popular sightseeing route. When the helicopter crashed, it was cloudy with winds around 10 to 15 mph with gusts up to 25 mph according to various weather reports in the area. Visibility at the surface was good  10 miles  but it was cloudy as a system is moving into the region, bringing light rain to the region this afternoon and evening. Helicopters on an air traffic control frequency were asked to look for anyone in the water following the crash. Please keep your eyes open. You guys see anything in the water, please let us know, said an emergency response pilot on the frequency. The FAA is temporarily prohibiting drone pilots from flying near todays helicopter crash unless they have specific authorization. FAA and NTSB to investigate cause The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed it is investigating the situation alongside the National Transportation Safety Board. The NTSB is leading the investigation and will provide updates. The helicopter was in the Special Flight Rules Area in New York, where no air traffic control services are provided, Secretary Duffy said in a post on X Thursday. Several minutes before entering that area, air traffic control from LaGuardia Airport was providing support, he said. The National Transportation Safety Board chair and investigators are on their way to the site of todays deadly helicopter crash in the Hudson River. The NTSB is launching a go-team to investigate Thursdays crash of a Bell 206 L-4 helicopter near Jersey City, New Jersey, the Board said in a social media post. The team is expected to arrive tonight. The cause of the crash is under investigation by the NTSB, which will pore over documentation on all the work that had been done on the aircraft. That would include the companys compliance with two recent Federal Aviation Administration issued airworthiness directives. One directive from May 2023 required the testing and possible replacement of tail rotor drive shafts on eight different Bell 206L models, including the 206L-4. That directive was prompted by an incident in which a Bell 206L helicopter experienced the loss of a tail-rotor drive due to a joint failure. The FAA also issued a December 2022 airworthiness directive on Bell 206L models with specific parts, requiring inspection and possible replacement of the helicopters main rotor blades because of delamination. That refers to layers within the blade separating due to material fatigue, damage (from bird strikes, for example), or manufacturing errors, potentially leading the rotor blade to fail. The helicopter that crashed in the Hudson River was built in 2004 and had an airworthiness certificate issued in 2016 that was valid until 2029, according to FAA records.
