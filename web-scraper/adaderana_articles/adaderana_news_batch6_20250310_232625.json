        "content": "A bilateral agreement pertaining to increasing the limit of the High Impact Community Development Project (HICDP) implemented in Sri Lanka with the support of the Indian government was signed today (Jan 20), the Presidents Media Division (PMD) says. The Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, Mahinda Siriwardana, signed the agreement on behalf of Sri Lanka while the Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Gopal Baglay signed on behalf of India. The agreement related to the community development project in Sri Lanka, first signed in May 2005, doubled the individual project limit from Rs. 300 million to Rs. 600 million. Through this agreement, the total HICDP funds will be doubled from Rs. 5 billion to Rs. 10 billion. This agreement guides many community development projects in Sri Lanka with the support of the Indian government, the PMD said further. The documents were signed after Indian External Affairs Minister (EAM) Dr. S. Jaishankar called on President Ranil Wickremesinghe earlier today. During the meeting, it was agreed upon to implement a joint program between Sri Lanka and India. Prior to the official meeting, President Wickremesinghe hosted the visiting Indian EAM for breakfast and tea at his official residence at Paget Road, Colombo. In addition, during the official meeting held between President Wickremesinghe and Dr. S. Jaishankar, many political, economic and social issues as well as investment matters between the two countries were discussed at length. During this discussion, special attention was paid to the debt-restructuring program in Sri Lanka which had received a positive response from the Indian government. The Indian External Affairs Minister recalled that in 1991, during the tenure of former Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, India had to face an economic crisis similar to what Sri Lanka is currently facing. He added that the Indian Government overcame the crisis by pledging the governments gold reserves. Therefore, Dr Jaishankar said that India has a good understanding of the situation Sri Lanka is currently facing and said that the Indian government will provide all possible support to solve the current economic problems faced by Sri Lanka.",

        "date": "January 20, 2023 06:20 pm",
        "content": "Google is laying off 12,000 workers, or about 6 of its workforce, becoming the latest tech company to trim staff as the economic boom that the industry rode during the COVID-19 pandemic ebbed. CEO Sundar Pichai informed staff Friday at the Silicon Valley giant about the cuts in an email that was also posted on the companys news blog. The firings add to tens of thousands of other job losses recently announced by Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook parent Meta and other tech companies as they tighten their belts amid a darkening outlook for the industry. Just this month, there have been at least 48,000 job cuts announced by major companies in the sector. Over the past two years weve seen periods of dramatic growth, Pichai wrote. To match and fuel that growth, we hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today. He said the layoffs reflect a rigorous review carried out by Google of its operations. The jobs being eliminated cut across Alphabet, product areas, functions, levels and regions, Pichai said. In a regulatory filing late last year, the company said that it employed nearly 187,000 people. Pichai said that Google, founded nearly a quarter of a century ago, was bound to go through difficult economic cycles. These are important moments to sharpen our focus, reengineer our cost base, and direct our talent and capital to our highest priorities, he wrote. There will be job cuts in the U.S. and in other countries, according to Pchais letter. Earlier this week, Microsoft announced 10,000 job cuts, or nearly 5 of its workforce. Amazon has said its cutting 18,000 jobs, although thats a fraction of its 1.5 million strong workforce. Facebook parent Meta is shedding 11,000 positions, or 13 of its workers, while business software maker Salesforce is laying off about 8,000 employees, or 10 of the total. Twitter CEO Elon Musk has slashed jobs at the company after he acquired it last fall. Employment in the U.S. has been resilient despite signs of a slowing economy, and there were another 223,000 jobs added in December. Yet the tech sector grew exceptionally fast over the last several years due to increased demand as employees began to work remotely. CEOs of a number of companies have taken blame for growing too fast, yet those same companies, even after the latest round of job cuts, remain much larger than they were before the economic boom from the pandemic began.

As the ICC authorities are now engaged with the law enforcement authorities in the US, they are tight-lipped over the matter but it has come to light that the total amount of USD 2.5 million is a result of multiple instances of being cheated. It brings to the spotlight the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and of his department in the Dubai office of ICC. For a full member like the BCCI, USD 2.5 million is not a major amount but the quantum of loss is equivalent to four times of the grant an Associate member with ODI status earns every year from the ICC.

        "title": "British PM fined for not wearing seatbelt in back of car",
        "date": "January 21, 2023 11:17 am",
        "content": "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has been fined for not wearing a seatbelt in a moving car while filming a social media video. Lancashire Police said it had issued a 42-year-old man from London with a conditional offer of a fixed penalty. No 10 said Mr Sunak fully accepts this was a mistake and has apologised, adding that he would pay the fine. Passengers caught failing to wear a seat belt when one is available can be fined 100. This can increase to 500 if the case goes to court. The prime minister was in Lancashire when the video was filmed, during a trip across the north of England. The video - to promote the governments latest round of levelling up spending - was posted on Mr Sunaks Instagram account. It is the second time Mr Sunak has received a fixed penalty notice while in government. Last April, he was fined along with Boris Johnson and wife Carrie for breaking Covid lockdown rules - by attending a birthday gathering for the then-prime minister in Downing Street in June 2020. Disregard for the rules Fixed penalty notices are a sanction for breaking the law, and mean a fine, which needs to be paid within 28 days, or contested. If someone chooses to contest the fine, the police will then review the case and decide whether to withdraw the fine or take the matter to court. Labours deputy leader Angela Rayner said in a tweet that Mr Sunak was a total liability. A Labour Party spokesperson added: Hapless Rishi Sunaks levelling-up photo op has blown up in his face and turned him into a laughing stock. The Liberal Democrats said, in becoming the second ever serving prime minister to be fined by police, he had shown the same disregard for the rules as Boris Johnson. Deputy Lib Dem leader Daisy Cooper said: From partygate to seatbelt gate, these Conservative politicians are just taking the British people for fools. Whilst they continue to behave as though its one rule for them and another for everyone else, this fine is a reminder that the Conservatives eventually get their comeuppance. But Conservative MP for Blackpool South Scott Benton defended Mr Sunak, saying everybody makes mistakes. Mr Benton said police should focus on tackling serious crime in our communities, adding: Lets keep this in proportion here. Every single year millions of Britons receive similar fixed penalty notices. Passengers aged 14 and over are responsible for ensuring they wear a seat belt in cars, vans and other goods vehicles if one is fitted. Drivers are responsible for passengers under 14. Exemptions include having a doctors certificate for a medical reason, or being in a vehicle used for a police, fire or other rescue service. Source - BBC - With input from agencies",

        "date": "January 21, 2023 01:09 pm",
        "content": "Chris Hipkins, New Zealands education minister, is bidding to replace Jacinda Ardern as prime minister, after her shock resignation announcement earlier this week. Hipkins emerged as the only candidate to be nominated for the leadership of the ruling Labour party on Saturday morning. The Labour Party caucus is due to meet on Sunday to formally endorse and confirm Hipkins as leader, party whip Duncan Webb said. New Zealands next general election is expected to be held on October 14. Hipkins is a career politician who entered Parliament in 2008, and became a household name leading New Zealands pandemic management as Covid-19 response minister in Arderns cabinet. Aside from being education minister, he is also minister for police and the public service, and Leader of the House. Speaking to reporters after nominations closed at 9 a.m. local time in the capital of Wellington, he said he aims to reach consensus about who is best to lead the Labour party, and therefore, New Zealand forward. I am absolutely humbled and honored, he said, then added, there is still a bit to go in this process. There is still a meeting tomorrow and a vote, and I dont want to get too far ahead of that. The minister went on to thank his party members, saying we have gone through this process with unity and we will continue to do that. He committed to leading the country in a strong, stable and unified way but cautioned there were challenges ahead. I acknowledge that at the moment, were going through some economic turbulence and were going to have to navigate our way through there, he said. Hipkins also told reporters that he is incredibly optimistic about New Zealands future and is really looking forward to the job. I am feeling energized and enthusiastic. He served almost two years as Covid-19 response minister in a country that kept infections and deaths relatively low after shutting its borders. He also oversaw New Zealands phased reopening before fully welcoming back all international travel last July. Ardern said Thursday that she would stand aside for a new leader, saying she doesnt believe she has the energy to seek reelection. Speaking at a news conference then, Ardern said her term would end by February 7, when she expected a new Labour prime minister would be sworn in  though depending on the process that could be earlier. Hipkins said Ardern  whose tenure coincided with a terrorist attack, natural disasters and a global pandemic  was the leader that we needed at the time that we needed it. And he acknowledged that, like Ardern, he would be opening himself up to a lot scrutiny and a lot of criticism by putting his name forward. I go into this job with my eyes wide open, knowing what Ive what Ive stepped into, Hipkins said. Source: CNN -Agencies",

        "content": "The Nanu Oya Police are currently looking to arrest the driver of the bus involved in the fatal accident that took place on the Radella Shortcut Road in Nuwara Eliya yesterday (20 Jan.). Speaking in this regard, Police Media Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa stated that although it is evident that negligence on the part of the bus driver played a role in the accident, it is yet to be determined as to whether a mechanical fault, or any other fault, contributed to the unfortunate incident. Seven casualties were reported last evening, when a bus fell down a 100-foot precipice after colliding with a van and a three-wheeler. All six persons travelling in the van, including the driver, and the driver of the three-wheeler died on the spot, while 53 passengers including students in the bus sustained injuries. The five persons travelling in the van are reportedly related, while three children aged 8, 12 and 19 are also among the deceased. The bus, which was en route to Colombo, was one of seven such buses that had been transporting a group of students of Thurstan College, Colombo, who were on an educational tour in Nuwara Eliya. Reports revealed that 53 passengers  including teachers, parents and 41 students of Grade 11  were inside the bus at the time of the accident. Those injured were airlifted back to Colombo today (21 Jan.), on the instructions of President Ranil Wickremesinghe.

        "content": "Rescuers in Tibet have discovered eight more bodies, increasing the death toll to 28 following an avalanche that buried multiple vehicles in deep snow and ice on a section of road connected to a highway tunnel. Chinese state media reported late on Friday that rescue workers had uncovered the eight bodies, digging by hand and with mechanical diggers to locate the vehicles buried in the avalanche, which took place at about 8pm (12:00 GMT) on Tuesday. It had hit a road and highway tunnel connecting the city of Nyingchi in Tibets southwest with outlying Medog county. Earlier on Friday, 20 people had been confirmed killed and eight were still missing, according to the state-run Global Times news outlet. Chinas state-run Xinhua News Agency reported that 53 people were rescued after the avalanche, with five of the survivors seriously injured. Authorities said the search and rescue operation has been largely completed, the news outlet reported. The avalanche hit a section of road between Pai village in Mainling county and the Doxong La tunnel in Medog county. A local villager told the Global Times that most of those travelling on the road at the time of the accident were Tibetan people returning to their hometowns for the Lunar New Year, which starts on Sunday. Rescue workers reported that vehicles were crushed under the weight of tonnes of snow and ice that collapsed at the mouth of the tunnel, trapping drivers in their vehicles. Nyingchi lies at an elevation of about 3,040 metres (9,974 feet) and is about five hours drive from the regional capital, Lhasa, along a highway opened in 2018. Night-time temperatures during winter routinely drop to well below freezing. Chinese authorities say some 1,000 rescue workers and dozens of emergency vehicles have been deployed to the site of the disaster. The snow was so deep it was as high as to peoples waist, and the road is very slippery. Many rescue workers stumbled all the way there, a local health centre employee said, according to the Global Times. Avalanches are not uncommon in the Himalayas. Last October, at least 26 people died when a mountaineering expedition was caught in an avalanche on Mount Draupadi ka Danda-II in Indias northern state of Uttarakhand.

        "date": "January 21, 2023 10:55 pm",
        "content": "National Peoples Power (NPP) leader MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake has warned Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardena that attempting to obstruct the upcoming Local Government (LG) election is a punishable offence. Speaking at a rally in Maligawatte yesterday (20 Jan.), Dissanayake noted that the deliberate obstruction of the upcoming election that is due to be held on 09 March, is an offence punishable by three years of imprisonment. The NPP leader said this in regard to the affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court last evening by Siriwardena, stating that securing additional funds for an election at a time state revenue is battered by the economic crisis is extremely challenging to the Treasury. Accordingly, Dissanayake noted that deferring the election would have been possible if the countrys economy was stable, however, this is not the case, he emphasised. He further argued that despite claims that there are no funds to hold the election, and that by doing so, it would only worsen the existing fuel and medicine crises, it takes only Rs. 8 billion to hold the election. It only takes Rs. 8 billion to hold the election. The recent sugar tax scandal in itself amounted to Rs. 15 million. From this money itself, we can hold two elections. If you brought this country to a state where it is unable to even hold an election, you need to leave, Dissanayake stated. He further questioned the Finance Secretarys authority to refuse giving the necessary funds for the election, when the Parliament itself has decided to allocate money for this purpose. The monetary power lies with the Parliament he said in this regard, adding that if the money is not being given by the Secretary, it will be deemed a deliberate obstruction of the election. Treasury Secretary Siriwardena yesterday submitted an affidavit to the Supreme Court pertaining to a writ application filed by retired Army Colonel W.M.R. Wijesundara, which, citing the prevailing economic crisis, has sought a court order to defer the local government election. In his affidavit, Siriwardena pointed out that the countrys export revenues dropped by 8.2 in 2021 due to the Covid-19 outbreak and as a result, the budget deficit increased by 11.6 in that year. Explaining that the government spends a sum of Rs. 90 billion on state sector salary payments, Rs. 28 billion each for Samurdhi allowances and importing essential items such as medicines and fertilizer, Siriwardana explained that the government is struggling to source funds to fulfill these essential needs of the public. In addition, the government had to incur a sum of Rs. 114 billion to settle interest payments and Rs. 169 billion for debt payments in the year 2022, Siriwardana added. He also recalled the decision taken by the government recently to delay the salary payments for executive-grade employees in the state sector by a few days due to the prevailing situation. Thus, he highlighted that election expenditure will gravely affect the fiscal condition of the country. Meanwhile, the Election Commission of Sri Lanka today announced that the LG election will be held on 09 March, while the deadline for the application of nominations was closed at 12:00 p.m. this afternoon. The Regulation of Election Expenditure Bill was also passed in Parliament on Thursday (19 Jan.), with a majority of 61 votes.

        "content": "China is expected to hand over its letter of support towards the financing and debt restructuring of Sri Lanka to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today (22 Jan.)., the Hindustan Times reported. This comes in the aftermath of Indias financial assurances to Sri Lanka. On Monday (16 Jan.), India told the IMF that it strongly supports Sri Lankas debt restructuring plan as the island nation seeks a 2.9 billion loan from the global lender. We hereby confirm our strong support for Sri Lankas prospective (loan) program and commit to supporting Sri Lanka with financingdebt relief consistent with restoring Sri Lankas public debt sustainability, Indian finance ministry official Rajat Kumar Mishra told the IMF chief. In the letter of support to IMF, addressed to IMF Managing Director Ms. Kristalina Georgieva, Indias finance ministry acknowledged Sri Lankas deeply unsustainable debt situation, the countrys engagement with creditors to restore debt sustainability, and confirmed its strong support to Colombos prospective extended finance facility supported program. New Delhi has made it clear that it is committed to supporting Sri Lanka with financingdebt relief consistent with restoring that countrys public debt sustainability under the IMF supported program and ensuring that the program is fully financed as projected by the Bretton Woods Institution. The Modi government has conveyed that this financingdebt relief will be provided by the Export Import Bank of India. Meanwhile, during his most recent official visit to Sri Lanka, Indian External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar also assured that the Indian government will provide all possible support to solve the current economic problems faced by Sri Lanka. India decided not to wait on others but to do what we believe is right. We extended financing assurances to the IMF to clear the way for Sri Lanka to move forward, Jaishankar said, adding that India is hopeful that this will not only strengthen Sri Lankas position but ensure that all bilateral creditors are dealt with equally. Speaking on securing financial assurance from China, the islands largest bilateral lender, Deputy Treasury Secretary Priyantha Ratnayake told Reuters on Friday (20 Jan.) that discussion with China are in the final stage. It is difficult to give details of the debt restructuring negotiations because of the confidentially of discussions, he said, adding that: However, we can say that discussions with China are at the final stage and we expect their assurances in the next few days. - With input from agencies",

        "title": "Brazil Congress riots: President Lula sacks army commander",
        "date": "January 22, 2023 12:40 pm",
        "content": "Brazils president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has sacked the countrys army chief, two weeks after rioting in the capital. General Julio Cesar de Arruda had only been in the role since 30 December - just before former president Jair Bolsonaros mandate ended. President Lula has said he suspects members of the armed forces colluded with protesters. He has dismissed dozens of military officers in recent days. Thousands of supporters of Mr Bolsonaro stormed government buildings in Brasília on 8 January after managing to march, largely unchallenged, through the city. Several police officers were injured in the violence and the presidential palace, Congress and Supreme Court were vandalised after rioters forced their way in. Some 2,000 people were detained on the day, Brazils federal police reported, and nearly 1,200 remain under arrest. The Supreme Court is investigating what happened and is including Jair Bolsonaro in the probe. Prosecutors said the far-right former leader may have incited the riot after posting a video that questioned the legitimacy of last years presidential election. He has denied any involvement in or responsibility for the uprising by his supporters. General Arruda is being replaced by a military commander close to the president - General Tomás Ribeiro Paiva. He made a speech earlier this week urging soldiers to accept the result of the presidential election. Unsubstantiated allegations of fraud in Octobers election were a driving motivation for many Bolsonaro supporters involved in the storming. Many were also enraged that President Lula, who was found guilty of corruption in 2017 and spent time in prison before his convictions were annulled, was back in power. President Lula blames Mr Bolsonaro directly for the rioting, but also points the finger very firmly at collusion by people inside the armed forces, the BBCs Latin America correspondent Will Grant reports. Mr Bolsonaro was previously an army captain and known to have the support of certain figures in the military. Our correspondent says Lulas sacking of the army commander and removal of dozens of officers responsible for presidential security are perhaps steps towards rebuilding trust in the military personnel who surround him. After this tumultuous start, Lula now faces the challenge of trying to govern in a bitter and thoroughly polarised atmosphere. On Friday, Brazils Defence Minister, José Múcio, said it was time to turn the page and focus on the countrys future - adding that the military as an institution was not involved in the rioting. Meanwhile, Jair Bolsonaro remains in Florida, where he has been since he refused to attend President Lulas inauguration ceremony. Last week, the former justice minister and a key ally of Mr Bolsonaro, Anderson Torres, was arrested after being accused of sabotaging police efforts to protect the buildings in Brasília.

Jeevan Thondaman, Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development-led Ceylon Workers Congress leaders and leaders of Tamil Progressive Alliance highlighted the socio-economic difficulties faced by people of plantation areas and sought Indias support in addressing their problems, the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka said in a statement. The interaction of minister Jaishankar with the leadership of the government of Sri Lanka provided an opportunity to review the whole gamut of bilateral relations between the two countries, the MEA said. He stressed his presence in Sri Lanka at a time when the country was going through multiple challenges sent a clear and strong message of continued support from the Government and the people of India to the people of the island-nation. On Friday (20 Jan.), Jaishankar said full implementation of the 13th amendment in the island country is critical for achieving reconciliation with the minority Tamil community. India has always supported both the political and economic stability of Sri Lanka. The President briefed me on the question of political devolution and his thinking. I shared with him our considered view that the full implementation of the 13th amendment and early conduct of provincial elections are critical in this regard, Jaishankar was quoted as saying in a press statement in Sri Lanka. The 13th Amendment provides for the devolution of power to the minority Tamil community which India has been pressing Sri Lanka to implement. This amendment was brought in after the Indo-Sri Lankan agreement of 1987. Jaishankar paid an official visit to Sri Lanka from 19  20 January, making this his fourth bilateral visit to the island nation during his tenure as Indias External Affairs Minister. Jaishankar was accompanied by a four-member official delegation from the Ministry in his latest visit to Sri Lanka, following earlier visits to the island nation in January 2021 and March 2022. Before Jaishankars visit, Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Sunday said his government is discussing problems of the North and the Tamil people, in a step towards reconciling the island nation that has suffered three decades of war and insurgency. We are discussing the problems of the North and the Tamil people. I called all the party leaders to the Parliament and said let us work to unite this country and restore harmony, Wickremesinghe was quoted as saying by the Sri Lankan Presidents media division in an address at the National Thai Pongal Festival on Sunday afternoon. In his address, Wickremesinghe said his government is hoping to fully implement the 13th Amendment to its Constitution not only in the northern part of the country but also in the South.

This is not such an easy task, he said, adding that If there is a mistake, a letter should have been sent to both me and the Parliament in this regard, questioning why such a thing has occurred. Subsequently, I should have been given a reasonable period of time to explain this. The PUCSL Chairman went on to explain the Parliamentary process by way of which he would be removed, adding that the procedure was a very systematic one. Thus, Ratnayake called on President Ranil Wickremeisnghe to appoint someone who understands the subject of the Ministry, adding that such an appointment would allow for easier negotiations to resolve the ongoing issues.",

        "date": "January 22, 2023 09:19 pm",
        "content": "Legal action is due to be taken against several vendors who were caught selling eggs at a higher price than that which was listed in the recent Gazette notification. Multiple raids were carried out today (22 Jan.), during which several such vendors were identified. Commenting on the matter, Chairman of the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) Shantha Niriella noted that regular grocery stores and markets will be fined between Rs. 100,000 and Rs. 500,000, those registered as companies will be fined between Rs 01 million and 05 million for the sale of eggs for prices higher than the maximum retail price. A Gazette notification was issued by the CAA on the advice of the Attorney General on Friday (20 Jan.), stipulating the new maximum retail price for eggs. Accordingly, a white egg will now be sold at an MRP of Rs. 44 and a brown egg for Rs. 46. Despite this, however, several vendors were seen selling eggs at various prices above Rs. 55 today, after the All Ceylon Egg Producers Association refused to abide by the Gazette.",

        "title": "Israelis stage giant protest against Netanyahu court reform",
        "date": "January 22, 2023 11:01 pm",
        "content": "An estimated 110,000 people have packed the streets of Tel Aviv, in one of Israels biggest anti-government protests in the past decade. The rallies spread across the city centre as banners were hoisted calling for an end to the ruling coalition, which is the most right-wing and religious-nationalist in Israels history. This is a dangerous government, said Yaara Ben Geraluf, a teacher from Jaffa, a western suburb on the coast. This government will not be any good for women, for LGBTQ, for the impoverished people and of course for Palestinians, she told the BBC. Organisers say they are trying to stop a coup taking place against the system of government. It is the second week running that mass protests have taken place in four different cities. Opposition leader Yair Lapid addressed the crowds in Tel Aviv, saying people who love the country came to defend its democracy and its courts. We wont give up until we win, he said. It comes three weeks after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned to power, to form Israels first stable coalition in three years. He said Israelis voted for a full right-wing government and for security. His coalition contains far-right parties, including one whose leader was once convicted of anti-Arab racism, and another who is openly homophobic and misogynistic. Protesters accuse Mr Netanyahu of threatening democratic rule, amid an unprecedented clash between the new government and Israels judges. The coalitions planned reforms would allow it to override the courts if they strike down future laws. Opponents say this threatens Israels democratic system of checks and balances. Critics also say Mr Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption, is trying to rein in the judges in an ultimate attempt to avoid going to jail himself. Many protesters also bitterly oppose positions from a coalition which includes overtly racist, homophobic and anti-Palestinian parties from the far-right. When it took office, the government declared exclusive Jewish rights to all areas of the land, including the occupied Palestinian territories. Tal Meidan, an interior designer from Tel Aviv, held a banner portraying Mr Netanyahu and two ultra-nationalist allies as the cats trying to take the cream. I think what they are doing is morally and ethically wrong, she told the BBC, holding her baby son Michael. I hope Im not going to cry, but we gave a lot to arrive at this country. And I dont want my children to go into the military in this era, she said. I hope so much that my four kids will have a different state in which we are equals, and Arabs are equal, and gays are equal otherwise, we dont see ourselves raising them here, unfortunately, she added. The protest movements are not united. Many focus opposition on what they see as an unprecedented attack on the legal system; others on what they see as an assault on secular life in Israel, with roughly half the coalition made up of strictly religiously observant parties and the religious-nationalist far-right. Others focus their campaign against Israels occupation of the Palestinian Territories, but these appeared to be in the minority during the protests. The BBC witnessed a minor scuffle break out when one protester objected to others raising Palestinian flags. Mr Netanyahu dismisses the protests, accusing participants of denying the will of voters. Two months ago there was a huge demonstration, the mother of all demonstrations. Millions of people went into the streets in order to vote in the elections, he said last week. One of the main topics that they voted on was reforming the judicial system. He added, I must say that when we were in the opposition, we did not call for civil war and did not speak about the destruction of the state I expect the leaders of the opposition to do the same. The demonstrations bring old dividing lines in Israel back into the open - between secular and religiously observant, and between liberals and nationalists. While the protesters have packed the streets in Tel Aviv, in Israel overall they have been relegated to the margins over the years. Israelis have moved decisively to the right, according to opinion polls. Meanwhile Benjamin Netanyahu has become more reliant on the most extreme elements of Israels religious-nationalist bloc, as once-loyal allies have deserted him. On trial for corruption, he has been left in arguably his weakest position yet as premier. Source - BBC - With input from agencies",

        "date": "January 23, 2023 10:56 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Kyiv on a surprise trip on Sunday, meeting President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and pledging that Britain would stick by Ukraine as long as it takes. Johnson, who left office in September in the wake of a series of scandals, was prime minister when Russia invaded Ukraine last February and he sought to position London as Kyivs top ally in the West. During his trip, Johnson visited Borodyanka and Bucha, the suburbs of the Ukrainian capital that became a byword for atrocities in the West when Russian forces drove towards Kyiv in the first phase of the invasion before being repelled. I can tell you that the UK will be sticking by Ukraine for as long as it takes, Johnson told the mayor of Bucha. Youre going to win and youre going to get all the Russians out of your country, but we will be there for the long-term. And we will also want to be helping you to reconstruct, he said speaking through an interpreter. Johnson has dismissed suggestions that his activity in Ukraine could be seen as undermining British Prime Minister Rusni Sunak. While in office, Johnson visited Kyiv several times and called Zelenskiy frequently. As he became embroiled in scandals in Britain, he gained widespread popularity in Ukraine where he became known affectionately as Borys Johnsoniuk. Cafes named cakes after him in Kyiv and street art was produced using his image. In Bucha, Johnson took selfies with residents and laid flowers in tribute to victims of the war. He visited a church to see an exhibition and signed the Ukrainian edition of his book about Winston Churchill for a priest. In Borodyanka, he walked the streets by ruined residential blocks. Kyiv regional governor Oleksiy Kuleba, who accompanied him, said that 162 residents were killed during the month-long Russian occupation of the town last year. Kuleba said about 60 of residents have since returned. In Kyiv, Johnson was personally welcomed by Zelenskiy and a row of top officials including the foreign minister and the head of the presidents office who lined up in a yard near the presidential administration in the heart of the city. Last week Britain said it would supply Ukraine with 14 Challenger 2 tanks and other heavy weaponry. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The ICC Mens T20I Team of the Year and the Womens T20I Team of the Year recognise the outstanding players who have impressed one and all - be it with the bat, the ball or their all-round exploits during 2022, which saw action across the globe including the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. Sri Lankan all-rounder Wanindu Hasaranga has been included in the ICC Mens T20I Team of the Year while Sri Lankan left-arm spinner Inoka Ranaweera is part of the Womens T20I Team of the Year 2022. Wanindu Hasaranga continued to be Sri Lankas talisman in a year where they reigned supreme as the champions of the Asia Cup. He picked up nine crucial wickets in six games at the Asia Cup but at the same time, showed that he can do the damage with the bat, stroking a brilliant 27-ball 37 in the final against Pakistan to rescue his side. The wrist-spinner weaved his magic at the T20 World Cup as well, picking up 15 wickets in eight games, the ICC said. On Inoka Ranaweeras inclusion in the team, the ICC said: Sri Lankas left-arm orthodox spinner Inoka Ranaweera had a spectacular year with the ball, finishing with 27 wickets in 19 T20Is, while averaging 13.85 with the ball and conceding runs at an economy rate of 5.75.

        "date": "January 23, 2023 05:36 pm",
        "content": "India is set to export a record 50 million eggs this month, boosted by sales to Malaysia, where there have been acute shortages as soaring feed prices caused by the Ukraine war forced many small-scale farmers to cut output, industry officials said. Middle Eastern countries, including Oman and Qatar, are the main buyers of eggs from India, but over the past few months, Indian hatcheries have received large orders from surprising quarters as output fell in some of the worlds top suppliers. The biggest such unexpected order came from Malaysia, which used to export eggs to Singapore and other Asian countries. To secure egg supplies as prices rose to record highs, Malaysian Minister of Agriculture and Food Security Mohamad Sabu earlier this month visited Namakkal, in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, where several leading hatcheries are based. For the first time, Malaysia is buying large quantities of eggs from India, and it seems that Indias egg exports to Malaysia will remain strong during the first half of 2023, Sasti Kumar, joint managing director at Namakkal-based Ponni Farms, one of Indias leading egg exporters, told Reuters. India shipped 5 million eggs to Malaysia in December, and will ship 10 million in January and up to 15 million in February, according Kumar. The outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly called bird flu, has curtailed supplies of eggs and chicken in many countries around the globe, pressuring already high food prices and triggering trade restrictions from countries that import poultry. The imports from India have helped Malaysia bring prices down from the record highs seen in late December. Having suffered a shortfall of 157 million eggs in November, the market gap was down to just one million in December, the Malaysian minister said in a statement earlier this week. Malaysias egg production would recover in a few months as the government has increased a subsidy, said Tan Chee Hee, president of the Federation of Livestock Farmers Association of Malaysia. Meantime, prices in India have shot up to a record 565 rupees (6.96) per 100 eggs, up by nearly a quarter on year ago prices and adding to domestic concerns over food price inflation. Exports are rising amid robust local consumption during the winter months, said Prasanna Pedgaonkar, general manager of poultry-focused Venkys. At the same time, Pedgaonkar said, domestic supplies have fallen by around a tenth as small-scale Indian farmers, like their counterparts in Malaysia, have curtailed production after incurring losses in the past two years due to the high price of feed and the impact of the pandemic. Indias domestic prices could eventually make exporting eggs less profitable, in which case foreign buyers will have to look elsewhere, said C Panneerselvam, an exporter also based in Namakkal who sold one million eggs to Malaysia last month. But for the time being, demand is not abating. Countries such as Singapore and Sri Lanka could be next in line to buy from India in coming months, said Kumar of Ponni Farms.

The island nation of 22 million people has grappled with challenges during the past year ranging from a shortage of foreign currency to runaway inflation and a steep recession - the worst such crisis since independence from Britain in 1948. Reuters reported last week that India had told the IMF it strongly supports Sri Lankas debt restructuring plan as the island seeks a 2.9 billion loan from the global lender, according to a letter. Sri Lanka is engaged with other official bilateral creditors to obtain similar assurances, an IMF spokesperson said in a statement on Monday. As soon as adequate assurances are obtained and remaining requirements are met, including by the Sri Lankan authorities, a Fund-supported program for Sri Lanka can be presented to the IMFs Executive Board for approval that would unlock much needed financing. Sri Lanka requires the backing of China and India - its biggest bilateral lenders - to reach a final agreement with the IMF that is essential to help the country emerge from its worst financial crisis in seven decades.

Two fatal shootings took place at a mushroom farm and a trucking firm on the outskirts of Half Moon Bay, a coastal community about 30 miles south of San Francisco, officials said. Dave Pine, the president of the San Mateo county board of supervisors, said that four people died at the farm and three at the trucking business. Police have arrested a suspect, named as 67-year-old Zhao Chunli, in connection with the shooting, Pine said. The shootings are being treated as related, although the connection between the locations was not immediately clear. Pine said the suspect was employed at one of the businesses and called him a disgruntled worker. The San Mateo county sheriffs office said shortly before 5pm that there was no ongoing threat to the community at this time. Aerial television images showed police officers collecting evidence from a farm with dozens of greenhouses. The shooting followed the killing of 11 people over the weekend at a ballroom dance hall in the southern California city of Monterey Park, near Los Angeles. It also comes on the heels of a shooting in Californias Central Valley last week, where six people, including an infant, were killed in the small town of Goshen. We are sickened by todays tragedy in Half Moon Bay, Pine said in a statement. We have not even had time to grieve for those lost in the terrible shooting in Monterey Park. Gun violence must stop. Other public figures spoke out in shock about the back-to-back killings. Two hours ago I joined my colleagues on the Capitol steps for a vigil for the victims of the shooting in Monterey Park, tweeted Marc Berman, a member of the California state assembly.

Nandalal Weerasinghe said on Tuesday. There has been good progress this month with India already pledging financing assurances. We expect assurances from China and Japan soon, Weerasinghe said at an event titled Economic Outlook 2023. The island nation of 22 million people has grappled with challenges during the past year ranging from a shortage of foreign currency to runaway inflation and a steep recession - the worst such crisis since independence from Britain in 1948. Sri Lanka is racing to secure a 2.9 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) but requires the backing of both China and India, its biggest bilateral creditors, to reach a final agreement with the global lender. India last week told the IMF that it strongly supports Sri Lankas debt restructuring plan. Once the IMF program is unlocked then we will start specific debt restructuring negotiations with both commercial and bilateral lenders, the head of the apex bank said. We hope to complete this process in six months. The biggest uncertainty is the timeframe for the debt restructuring. It is only after debt sustainability is assured can Sri Lanka return to a sustainable growth path, he added. Weerasinghe added that good progress has been made in negotiations with the Paris Club creditor nations and other creditors. On the domestic front, talks with local banks to reduce rates were ongoing but restructuring of domestic debt remains an uncertainty, he said. On a separate note, Weerasinghe said Sri Lankas inflation would reduce at a faster pace in 2023 and expects it to reach single digits by end of 2023. The central bank is aiming to bring down interest rates in line with inflation expectations and the process would be fast-tracked once the IMF programme is unlocked, he added. Sri Lankas National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) (LKNCPIECI) eased year-on-year to 59.2 in December, after a 65 rise in November, data on Monday showed. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

Such mistakes have been made by ministerial secretaries previously as well, and since it has not led to any prejudice, I do not think there is a need or a way to take any action against these officials, Gunawardena said with regard to the recent controversies surrounding Hapuhinna. On 09 January, Hapuhinna, in a letter addressed to all Returning Officers, instructed them to stop accepting the deposits placed by the candidates for the local government election, until further notice, citing a decision taken by the Cabinet of Ministers. Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, in a video statement issued the following day, slammed the efforts to postpone the local government election and called on the government not to play with the peoples right to vote. Hapuhinna, who found himself in hot water over the matter, recalled the letter just a day after it was issued and apologized for any inconvenience that may have been caused when he was summoned to the Election Commission on 13 January.",

        "date": "January 24, 2023 03:33 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - The Export-Import Bank of China has offered Sri Lanka a two-year moratorium on its debt and said it will support the countrys efforts to secure a 2.9 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, according to a letter reviewed by Reuters. India wrote to the IMF earlier this month, saying it would commit to supporting Sri Lanka with financing and debt relief, but the island nation also needs the backing of China in order to reach a final agreement with the global lender. Regional rivals China and India are the biggest bilateral lenders to Sri Lanka, a country of 22 million people that is facing its worst economic crisis in seven decades. According to the letter, the Export-Import Bank of China said it was going to provide an extension on the debt service due in 2022 and 2023 as an immediate contingency measure based on Sri Lankas request. At the end of 2020, China EXIM bank had loaned Sri Lanka 2.83 billion which is 3.5 of the islands debt, according to an IMF report released in March last year. ...you will not have to repay the principal and interest due of the banks loans during the above-mentioned period, the letter said. Meanwhile, we would like to expedite the negotiation process with your side regarding medium and long-term debt treatment in this window period. Sri Lanka owed Chinese lenders 7.4 billion, or nearly a fifth of its public external debt, by the end of last year, calculations by the China Africa Research Initiative showed. The bank will support Sri Lanka in your application for the IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) to help relieve the liquidity strain, the letter said. Sri Lankas foreign and finance ministries did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters. Sri Lankas central bank chief P. Nandalal Weerasinghe said on Tuesday that the country hoped for assurances from China and Japan, another major bilateral lender, soon and complete debt restructuring in six months.

        "content": "The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has approved power cuts of two hours and 20 minutes for the next two days (25 and 26 Jan.). Accordingly, power will be interrupted for one hour during the daytime and one hour and 20 minutes during the night for Groups A  L and Groups P  W. Yesterday, however, the PUCSL had approved power cuts of only two hours for today (24 Jan.), with a 40-minute interruption in the daytime, and one hour and 20 minutes during the night for all groups. Meanwhile, the PUCSL also recently requested the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to refrain from imposing power cuts after 07:00 p.m. during the ongoing 2022 GCE Advanced Level Examination, based on requests made by various parties including the Department of Examinations. Later that day, however, the CEB noted that power cuts will have to be imposed even during the period in which the exam will be held, owing to the high costs incurred for the generation of electricity, and the lack of funds in this regard.

        "date": "January 24, 2023 03:36 pm",
        "content": "A writ application has been filed with the Court of Appeal seeking an order rescinding the cabinet ministers directive to the Public Utilities Commission (PUCSL) with regard to increasing the electricity tariffs. The cabinet ministers had earlier instructed the electricity sector regulator to work with the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to take necessary measures to increase the tariffs. The Electricity Consumers Association and the Centre for Environmental Justice had put forward the said writ application, naming the CEB, the Minister of Power  energy, the PUCSL, the Attorney General and several others as its respondents. The writ application, recalling the decision taken by the cabinet ministers to increase electricity tariffs, mentioned that the Public Utilities Commission has been directed to take joint measures with the CEB to implement the tariff hike. Pointing out that the PUCSL is an independent commission, the petitioners underscored that the cabinet ministers are not vested with the power to give such directives. Accordingly, they have requested the Appeals Court to issue an order invalidating all directives given by the cabinet ministers to the PUCSL on increasing electricity tariffs.",

        "date": "January 24, 2023 05:08 pm",
        "content": "The aim of the Committee on Public Finance (COPF), regardless of allegiances, will be to stand by the reforms promulgated by the IMF and being executed by the Central Bank, the committees chairman MP Harsha de Silva says. His remark comes in the wake of a Central Bank confirmation that they are confident of having an actual IMF first tranche disbursement within the first quarter of 2023. The COPF has queried the severe social implications of such steep mechanisms to adhere to IMF conditions. In response, the Central Bank has confirmed that the IMF is wary about the social impact on vulnerable communities and has invoked certain safeguards such as expenditure ceilings to negate those effects. When questioned about the adverse effects of market contraction due to the stifling interest rates, the Central Bank has acknowledged that those measures have been taken to limit growth in order to prevent the need for greater foreign exchange given the dwindling amount currently in the country. The Central Bank went on to reiterate that with a cash infusion via the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) from IMF, interest rates can once again be relaxed, and the market will once again have an opportunity to expand. When the question of alternatives to an IMF bailout were reached, the Central Bank has stressed that no other international financingfunding institute is willing to partner with Sri Lanka on its debt management unless they see an IMF partnership materialize first. With the ostensible debt treatment measures that an IMF program accompanies, it reassures international agencies of Sri Lankas credibility to once more partner with the country for future ventures including debt management. The Central Bank has stressed that this is why it is imperative for Sri Lanka to lock in the bailout. State Minister Suren Raghavan, MPs Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, Rauff Hakeem, Chandima Weerakkody, Harshana Rajakaruna, Vijitha Herath, Mayantha Dissanayake and Madhura Withanage were present at this committee meeting.",
