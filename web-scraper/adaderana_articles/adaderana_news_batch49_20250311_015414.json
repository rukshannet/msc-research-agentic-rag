        "content": "The Diyawadana Nilame of Sri Dalada Maligawa Pradeep Nilanga Dela, handed over the Esala Perahera Scroll to President Ranil Wickremesinghe this afternoon (31). The Scroll highlights the meticulous execution of the annual Esala Perahera at Kandys Sri Dalanda Maligawa (Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic), a magnificent cultural festival celebrated with great reverence for ancient traditions. Accompanied by the Nilames of Sathara Maha Dawala and Pitisara Dewala, including the Diyawadana Nilame of Sri Dalada Maligawa Pradeep Nilanga Dela, the procession made its way to the Kandy Presidents House. The President warmly welcomed them at the main gate of the premises. In accordance with custom, the Diyawadana Nilame formally presented the Scroll of Memorandum to the President. As a symbolic gesture, the President offered a fruit treat to the baby elephant Sindu, reminiscent of the elephants that graced the procession. Continuing the tradition, a group photo was taken with the Nilames and the President. President Ranil Wickremesinghe took the opportunity to honour the artists who participated in the Perahera by presenting them with traditional gifts and awards. Additionally, he extended financial support to Pitisara Devala through the Esala Perahera Trust and shared the book Sacred Dalada Culture, a compilation by the Central Provincial Ministry of Culture. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, expressing his deep gratitude to all those who supported the Perahera, including the Diyawadana Nilame and led by the Nilames of the Sathara Devala, emphasized the significance of safeguarding the historical Kandy Esala Perahera. He highlighted that this event was not only a religious and national celebration, but also a grand cultural festival that showcased Sri Lankan heritage to the global stage.

        "date": "August 31, 2023 07:37 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka saw a notable increase in workers remittances and a boost in tourist arrivals in July 2023, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) says. In its latest report on the external sector performance, the CBSL said the workers remittances recorded in July 2023 climbed to USD 541 million from USD 279 million in the corresponding month in 2022. Meanwhile, tourist arrivals amounted to 143,039 as opposed to the figure recorded in June 2023, which stood at 100,388. The cumulative tourist arrivals during January-July 2023 reached 767,913, compared to 458,670 arrivals recorded during the corresponding period in 2022. Earnings from tourism in July 2023 were estimated at USD 219 million, in comparison to USD 123 million in June 2023 and USD 85 million in the corresponding month in the previous year. Consequently, earnings from tourism during January-July 2023 amounted to USD 1,094 million, compared to USD 765 million in the corresponding period in 2022. India, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France were the main source countries for tourist arrivals during this period. The report also said the merchandise trade deficit widened in July 2023 due to the combined impact of relatively low export earnings and high import expenditure, compared to July 2022. The deficit in the merchandise trade account increased in July 2023 to USD 367 million from USD 122 million in July 2022. However, the cumulative trade deficit during January-July 2023 remained significantly low at USD 2,657 million, compared to the corresponding period in 2022 which stood at USD 3,628 million.",

        "date": "August 31, 2023 09:57 pm",
        "content": "A fundamental rights (FR) petition was filed before the Supreme Court today (Aug. 31) seeking the appointment of a five-member committee of specialist doctors led by the Director-General of Health Services (DGHS) to conduct a transparent probe into the deaths of patients and complications caused by substandard drugs imported to Sri Lanka. Main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MPs Kavinda Jayawardhana and Harshana Rajakaruna put forward the petition, naming Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, DGHS Dr. Asela Gunawardena, National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) and its chairman Prof. S.D. Jayaratne and several others as its respondents. Noting that the NMRA is responsible for registration, cancellation of registration, granting permission for manufacture, ensuring the quality, stipulating the prices and granting permission for storage of medicinal drugs used in the country, the petitioners pointed out that the use of two imported anesthetic drugs and an eye drop resulted in complications and even the deaths of some patients. Although the use of these drugs was suspended, a comprehensive investigation into these incidents is yet to be conducted, the petitioners emphasized. The SJB MPs, in their petition, further said that reports are rife that the proper procedure has not been followed when importing these drugs into the country. The petitioners also sought a Supreme Court order ruling that the complications and the deaths of patients caused by these imported substandard drugs are a violation of fundamental rights. They also requested the Supreme Court to appoint a committee of specialist doctors headed by the DGHS to probe the matter impartially.",

        "title": "Asia Cup: Sri Lanka register comfortable five-wicket win over Bangladesh",
        "date": "August 31, 2023 10:16 pm",
        "content": "Defending Asia Cup champions Sri Lanka began their 2023 campaign with a resounding five-wicket victory over Bangladesh, their record-setting 11th consecutive victory in ODIs. The victory was setup by an excellent bowling performance led by Matheesha Pathirana (4-32) and Maheesh Theekshana (2-19) that kept Bangladesh down to a sub-par 164 on a sluggish surface in Pallekele. Fifties from Sadeera Samarawickrama and Charith Asalanka then helped the hosts scale the target with 11 overs to spare. Bangladesh appeared to have begun the game on the front foot after winning the toss but home captain Dasun Shanaka wasnt perturbed about having to bowl first on a familiarly slow and two-paced wicket. There was the added threat of rain that made batting under lights with a potential DLS-revised target a good proposition. His understanding of the conditions was reflected in his bowling changes, notably with the use of Theekshana with the new ball. The off-spinner struck with just his second ball to trap debutant Tanzid Hasan LBW for a duck. Offspinner Dhananjaya de Silva, introduced into the attack in the eighth over, took only two balls more to join the wickets column by dismissing the other opener, Mohammad Naim. The batter stepped out to hit but was beaten in the air and by the drift and ended up slicing a simple catch to backward point. Pathirana was introduced into the attack only in the 11th over but he too struck with his fourth ball, giving his side the big wicket of Shakib Al Hasan, who underedged an attempted cut shot to the keeper. At 363, the Bangladesh innings was in need of a swift revival. There was revival but it wasnt swift. Shanto held one end up with risk-free cricket and Towhid Hridoy gave him company in a sedate 59-run partnership for the fourth wicket. But just when the partnership seemed like it had moved past the troubled waters, Shanaka made another bowling change that paid quick dividends. This time, the skipper brought himself on and in just his second over had Hridoy miss an attempted flick and wear a length ball on his pads. Though it appeared as if the batter had crossed the three-metre mark where DRS is no longer applicable, it wasnt to be and the Sri Lankan captain was vindicated with three reds on the screen. On a slow track, Pathirana then got a pacy delivery to climb on Mushfiqur Rahim and had him caught playing an upper cut straight to third man. Mehidy Hasan Miraz was calamitously run out and Bangladeshs innings quickly unravelled once Shanto fell to a superb carrom ball from Theekshana. The final six wickets fell for only 37 runs with Pathiranas change of pace proving too much for Bangladeshs tail to cope with. Batting got significantly easier under lights but that didnt stop Bangladesh from inducing some jitters in the home dressing room. Taskin Ahmed bowled a perfect inswinger to castle Dimuth Karunaratne and while Shoriful Islam angled a delivery across Pathum Nissanka and had him caught behind. When Kusal Mendis was cleaned up by a Shakib Al Hasan delivery for a painstaking 5 off 21 deliveries, Sri Lanka were 433 and in need of a partnership to put the chase back on track. Samarawickrama and Asalanka did just that by wading through the pressure with some risk-averse accumulation of runs. Singles were plentiful and with Bangladesh looking to attack, so too was the occasional boundary. Samarawickrama cut Shakib for a four and forced the overcompensation to flick another delivery to mid-wicket for boundary. Asalanka was particularly impressive in employing the sweep shot against the Bangladeshi spinners. The pair put on 78 runs for the fourth wicket before Samarawickrama walked right past a Mahedi Hasan delivery to be dismissed stumped for a 77-ball 54. By then, however, Sri Lanka were only 44 runs from victory and although they lost Dhananjaya de Silva cheaply, Asalanka anchored the chase and helped himself to a half-century to close out an important win in what is a tricky three-team Group B. Brief scores: Bangladesh 164 in 42.4 overs (Najmul Hossain Shanto 89; Matheesha Pathirana 4-32, Maheesh Theekshana 2-19) lost to Sri Lanka 1655 in 39 overs (Charith Asalanka 62, Sadeera Samarawickrama 54; Shakib Al Hasan 2-29) by five wickets.

He made this remark when UNDP Resident Representative Azusa Kubota visited him at the Temple Trees on Thursday (Aug. 31) together with the members of the UNDP experts team Dr Sabina Alkire, Director, Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), University of Oxford and Prof Siri Hettige, Professor in Sociology to hand over the UNDP MVI MPI Reports.

Kubota explained that the data for the report was collected from a national-level survey capturing insights from 25,000 households covering the issues related to nutrition, education, household debt, or risks of disasters. Dr Alkire said the MVI MPI offer a robust evidence base to better understand the challenges faced by vulnerable groups and to assist policymakers in formulating targeted and effective policies. Prof. Hettige said the database on poverty and vulnerability will be useful for the government to effectively plan its policy programs to bring Sri Lanka back on track and onto a more sustainable development pathway.

        "title": "Saudi man receives death penalty over posts online",
        "date": "September 1, 2023 10:59 am",
        "content": "A Saudi court has sentenced a man to death over his posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, and his activity on YouTube, the latest in a widening crackdown on dissent in the kingdom that has drawn international criticism. The judgement against Mohammed bin Nasser al-Ghamdi, seen Wednesday by The Associated Press, comes against the backdrop of doctoral student Salma al-Shehab and others facing decades-long prison sentences over their comments online. The sentences appear part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salmans wider effort to stamp out any defiance in the kingdom as he pursues massive building projects and other diplomatic deals to raise his profile globally. Al-Ghamdis death sentence over tweets is extremely horrific but stands in line with the Saudi authorities escalating crackdown, said Lina Alhathloul, the head of monitoring and advocacy at the London-based advocacy group ALQST. Lengthy prison sentences issued for free speech, such as 27 years against Salma al-Shehab, have not received sufficient outcry, and the authorities have taken this as a green light to double down on their repression, Alhathloul said. They are sending a clear and sinister message  that nobody is safe and even a tweet can get you killed. Officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment over the sentence handed down by Saudi Arabias Specialized Criminal Court, which was established to hear terror cases but now also weighs charges against activists. According to court documents, the charges levied against al-Ghamdi include betraying his religion, disturbing the security of society, conspiring against the government and impugning the kingdom and the crown prince  all for his activity online that involved re-sharing critics posts. Saudi officials offered no reason for why they specifically targeted al-Ghamdi, a retired school teacher living in the city of Mecca. However, his brother, Saeed bin Nasser al-Ghamdi, is a well-known critic of the Saudi government living in the United Kingdom. This false ruling aims to spite me personally after failed attempts by the investigators to have me return to the country, the brother tweeted last Thursday. Saudi Arabia has used arrests of family members in the past as a means to pressure those abroad into returning home, activists and those targeted in the past say. The sentence drew immediate criticism from international rights groups. Repression in Saudi Arabia has reached a terrifying new stage when a court can hand down the death penalty for nothing more than peaceful tweets, said Joey Shea, a researcher at Human Rights Watch. Saudi Arabia is one of the worlds top executioners, behind only China and Iran in 2022, according to Amnesty International. The number of people Saudi Arabia executed last year  196 inmates  was the highest recorded by Amnesty in 30 years. In one day alone last March, the kingdom executed 81 people, the largest known mass execution carried out in the kingdom in its modern history. However, al-Ghamdis case appears to be the first in the current crackdown to level the death penalty against someone for their online behavior. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "September 1, 2023 12:23 pm",
        "content": "In a strategic move toward a developed Sri Lanka by 2048, President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the dual importance of technology and financial literacy for the next generations. Speaking at the inauguration of the Capital Market Club program in Kandys Nugawela Central College on Thursday (31 Aug), President Wickremesinghe disclosed key plans for this transformative journey. Among the Presidents notable announcements was the integration of the Central Banks reports into schools for discussion. To facilitate this, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is set to introduce a comprehensive training program for teachers and student leaders. This initiative aims to bolster awareness of the stock market and enhance financial literacy among students across the nation. The collaborative effort behind this program involves the Presidential Secretariat, the Ministry of Education, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Colombo Stock Exchange. These institutions have joined forces to execute President Wickremesinghes vision, with the ultimate goal of cultivating an informed and financially aware younger generation. During the ceremony, President Wickremesinghe presented the charter certificate and a substantial grant of Rs. 100,000 to Principal Dhammika Bandara, marking the establishment of the Capital Market Club at the Nugawela Central College. Moreover, the President handed over a compilation of knowledge-packed books on Capital Market Clubs to Mrs. Achini Kanitiwela, who is spearheading the subject. The Secretary of the Ministry of Education M.M. Ranasinghe, Securities and Exchange Commission Director General Chinthaka Mendis and Colombo Stock Exchange Chief Executive Officer Rajiva Bandaranaike signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on this program. The artistic contributions of the colleges art teacher, Mrs. Nayana Wijekoon, were also acknowledged with the presentation of a portrait of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further said; The world will pass us by if we rotate in one place, emphasized the Minister of Education during his speech, where he referenced the lyrics of a song. With this perspective in mind, we are launching this program today. For a considerable period, we operated within the paradigms of the industrial age that characterized the mid-20th century and these principles infiltrated our political landscape. The outcomes of this approach dont need elaboration. In the years 2021 and 2022, our nation faced the dual challenges of economic distress and the Covid epidemic, leading us to a state of economic insolvency. However, I have initiated a program to rescue our country from this dire situation. It is noteworthy that our government is successfully navigating this endeavour. Our focus must now shift towards advancing without regressing into the abyss that threatens our nations progress. Its imperative to decide whether we should persist with mid-20th century policies or chart a new course with fresh perspectives. Adhering to outdated methods would jeopardize our countrys very existence, considering the significant gap between our current state and our desired destination. Equally crucial is ensuring that the upcoming generation, entrusted with the countrys future, does not inherit such a predicament. Thus, embarking on a technological journey becomes imperative. The technological strides of the 21st century need no introduction. Recalling our school days, where a telephone in every village was a distant dream, its striking to observe that today, mobile phones are omnipresent. Some individuals even possess multiple devices. Such is the transformation. While embracing this change, it is paramount to introduce modern technology to our nation. Substantial efforts are already underway, both within the Ministry of Education and various research institutes. Consequently, determining the implementation of new technological methods becomes a pivotal task. From blockchain technology to artificial intelligence and genome science, we must forge ahead with these innovations. Crucially, these advancements should reach rural communities. Our initiative to modernize agriculture aims to bring these technologies closer to home. However, its essential to acknowledge that technology alone is insufficient. These endeavours require financial support within a society that operates on monetary transactions. The current governmental landscape lacks the means to entirely govern monetary utilization and this holds true on both the domestic and international fronts. In the past, the digital realm was a distant concept. It was in 1993 that I signed the agreement to introduce the internet to Sri Lanka. Until then, these possibilities were alien to us. Thanks to this new technology, we have swiftly connected with the global community. In todays competitive economic climate, financial systems operate without heeding national boundaries. Whether favourable or not, we must adapt within these constraints. The global economy draws its sustenance from various sources, including banks and stock markets. Money serves as the driving force. Ultimately, its essential to acknowledge the pivotal role of money. Similar to the private sector, the government also engages with the money market and issues Treasury Bonds. Today, our objective is to acquaint you with this methodology, marking the initial step in this educational journey. Furthermore, my aspiration is to introduce discussions on the Central Bank report within schools starting from the upcoming year. I am actively engaging with the Ministry of Finance in this endeavour. To facilitate this, we are equipping both teachers and student leaders with training, while also garnering support from bank officials. This initiative underscores the need for familiarity with contemporary methods. Our focus extends beyond the mere dissemination of knowledge; it encompasses financial literacy and securities education that should reach even the most remote villages. Talented individuals reside within these communities and it is incumbent upon us to provide them with the essential training. Simultaneously, we must recognize that todays world operates as a single market. To align with this reality, we are in the process of signing multiple free trade agreements. Deliberations are ongoing with nations such as Singapore, India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia, China, Malaysia and Vietnam. Anticipated expansions into new markets encompass East Asia, South East Asia, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Additionally, conversations are underway with the European Union to explore potential facilities. In a fortnight, a delegation from the United States will be visiting our nation for discussions. Hence, a comprehensive awareness of the global market and these agreements becomes paramount. The emerging economy we are shaping is both environmentally conscious and digitally driven. Within the framework of this green and digital economy, securities hold their place. This paradigm shift introduces novel approaches. Complementing this transition, our focus extends to an offshore economy. Discussions involving specialized bar associations in London are shaping the corresponding legal landscape. A critical decision lies before us: whether to embrace these pioneering economic systems or remain in stagnation. In a decade or so, a significant majority of our populace will fall within the 25-35 age bracket. Today, the imperative to chart ones future looms large. We provide the essential knowledge, but the hands-on application lies in your hands. This program has been inaugurated today.Currently, weve selected 100 schools for participation, with intentions to expand this number subsequently. I urge the stock market and the Securities Exchange Commission to actively collaborate and extend their involvement. I request their engagement in overseeing one or two of these associations, providing their valuable support. A seed fund of Rs.10 million has been allocated for the programs initiation. Accordingly, each school will receive Rs. 100,000. I beseech that we confine this financial aspect to this amount. After a year has elapsed, we will evaluate the successful implementation of this program by each school. The winning school, along with its subject teacher and 10 students, will be rewarded with a trip to Singapore to study the workings of its stock market for a brief period. Hence, I emphasize the need to limit the monetary allocation to Rs. 100,000. This rule applies uniformly, irrespective of whether the school is located in an underprivileged or affluent area. Additionally, we aspire to extend opportunities to the second and third-place contenders. This endeavour aligns with our mission to bring the new economy to the grassroots level. With this challenge, I entrust you as part of the grand vision to transform our country into a developed nation by 2048. My heartfelt gratitude extends to all those who have contributed to and orchestrated this endeavour. While visiting Nugawela Central today, I was reminded of another significant chapter in our educational history. It was during that time that the concept of middle schools was introduced and subsequently adopted by the State Council under the leadership of the then Minister of Education, C.W.W. Kannangara. This initiative faced backlash, as evidenced by his defeat in the parliamentary elections by the people of Horana. Such challenges are an integral part of an education ministers journey. In contrast, D.S. Senanayake, the subsequent Prime Minister of the following government, assumed office. Mr. Nugawela, affectionately known as Mr. A.D. Nugawela, was appointed as the Minister of Education. He played a pivotal role in establishing 50 schools and we extend our gratitude for founding 49 additional schools in addition to Nugawela Central College. It is with a deep sense of contentment that I embark on this new program within a school that he had envisioned and established. Addressing the gathering, Dr. Susil Premajayanth, the Minister of Education, underscored the origins of STEM education stemming from a survey conducted in the United States of America in 1999. This educational framework was subsequently introduced by 2003 and its global adoption is evident with approximately a hundred nations currently implementing this system. Reflecting this trend, the nation has embarked upon the incorporation of STEM education. While these educational models demonstrate theoretical worth within the limits of the classroom, the challenges lie in their practical implementation. A notable concern arises from the observation that a substantial number of students lack comprehension in areas such as cheques and bills of exchange. The disconnection between classroom instruction and real-world applications becomes apparent, particularly in fields like commerce. Despite the presence of numerous commercial banks within Sri Lanka, students studying commerce seldom gain hands-on exposure to banking operations. The limited accessibility to the intricacies of the capital market poses another challenge. To address these gaps, a pioneering initiative is being launched today. This initiative aims to equip school leavers with substantial knowledge to engage as informed investors. By bridging the gap between theoretical instruction and practical experience, this project seeks to empower students with a profound understanding of investment dynamics and the workings of the capital market. Mr. Randula Abeyweera, the Presidential Director of Youth Affairs and Sustainable Development, metaphorically conveyed the notion that a small seed sown in the ground can eventually grow into a towering tree, providing shade to countless individuals. This metaphor serves as a symbolic inspiration for the current endeavour taking place within capital market schools. Aligned with the visionary principles set forth by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, a comprehensive strategy has been devised to establish capital market clubs within educational institutions. This strategic initiative has been set in motion, starting with the meticulous selection of 100 schools based on their outstanding performance in the commercial sector as gauged by A-level results. This discerning approach aims to foster a dynamic learning environment that bridges the gap between theoretical instruction and real-world application in the realm of capital markets. Mr. Rajiva Bandaranaike, the Chief Executive Officer of the Colombo Stock Exchange, expressed the profound significance of the Capital Market Clubs inauguration, in alignment with the visionary principles championed by the President. This club, which was launched today, is aptly characterized as an investment in the future. The gravity of this initiative is underscored by the collaborative effort involving four prominent national institutions. The understanding that collective endeavours yield greater outcomes than individual pursuits is at the core of this strategic move. The overarching objectives encompass expanding the participation base within the capital market domain, fostering synergistic educational collaborations and establishing distinguished financial educational brands. By embarking on this journey, the initial stride has been taken toward translating this visionary concept into tangible action. This step symbolizes a deliberate commitment to driving transformative change within the realm of financial education and engagement. Mr. Faisal Saleh, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka, emphasized the paramount significance of financial literacy in the context of capital market involvement. He noted a prevalent lack of knowledge concerning financial literacy within the region. In response, the establishment of these Capital Market Clubs has been undertaken to provide comprehensive insights into the prudent utilization of money. By introducing these educational platforms within the school framework, students can acquire a foundational understanding of financial matters directly within the academic environment. Notably, students have exhibited keen interest in this subject matter. Schools have orchestrated plans to disseminate this valuable knowledge to students starting from the 6th grade onwards. The Ministry of Education and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka play pivotal roles in directly facilitating this initiative. Furthermore, arrangements are in place to conduct seminars targeting school students in the future, augmenting their financial literacy journey. The hope is to garner support from key figures, such as the President and the Minister of Education, to incorporate this subject into the revised school syllabus. The event witnessed the presence of Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, State Ministers Lohan Ratwatte, Dilum Amunugama, Member of Parliament Gunathilaka Rajapaksa, Central Province Governor Lalith U. Gamage, Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake, Chairman of the Colombo Stock Exchange Dilshan Weerasekera, along with government officials, Principals, teachers, students and a diverse assembly of attendees.",

        "content": "Sri Lanka has repaid USD 100 million more to Bangladesh, which had lent USD 200 million to the crisis-hit island nation two years ago. Confirming this development on Friday, Bangladesh Bank Executive Director and spokesperson Mezbaul Haque told the media that Bangladesh received USD 2.8 million more in interest with the second installment. Sri Lanka reimbursed USD 50 million to Bangladesh in the first installment of the loan on August 17. Mezbaul earlier said the central bank was optimistic that Sri Lanka would honor its commitment to repay the entire loan amount within the current year. Back in 2021, the Bangladesh Bank provided a USD 200 million loan to Sri Lanka, which was then grappling with financial challenges. This assistance was drawn from the foreign exchange reserves under a currency swap arrangement. The loan had an initial term of one year, which concluded in September of the following year. Due to Sri Lankas persisting economic turmoil, the nation requested extensions for the repayment period. Bangladesh accommodated this request, granting two phases of extensions  first, an additional six months until March of this year, and later another six-month extension until September.

The license cancellation is effective from September 01, 2023. Accordingly, Bimputh Finance is not allowed to engage in finance business hereafter. CBSLs Monetary Board has observed that Bimputh Finance has been continuously violatingcontravening the provisions of the Finance Business Act, several generation directions and rules that have been issued with the view to achieve the overall objective of financial system stability and also specific directions issued to the company to address its critical financial position. Consequently, the financial condition of Bimputh Finance had been deteriorating due to deficient capital level, poor asset quality and continuous losses, the CBSL said in a statement. Despite several time extensions granted to Bimputh Finance by the Monetary Board to comply with the provisions of the Finance Business Act, Directions and Rules issued thereunder and adhere to the Masterplan for Consolidation of Non-Bank Financial Institutions, no satisfactory progress has been made by the company to revive the critical condition it was facing. Taking into consideration of the above, the Monetary Board decided to cancel the license issued to Bimputh Finance, under the Finance Business Act to carry on finance business, with effect from today, the statement read further. Largely complying with the Monetary Board directions issued, Bimputh Finance has managed to repay a major portion of its deposit liabilities during 2022, the CBSL added. Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance and Liquidity Support Scheme (SLDILSS) will initiate necessary actions to pay compensation to the unclaimed depositors of the company, up to a maximum of Rs. 1,100,000 per depositor as per the regulations of the SLDILSS.

Three witnesses have confirmed that they are capable of visually identifying the suspects, the CID officers told the court, thus seeking an order to refer the trio to an identification parade. The defense attorney then requested the additional magistrate to issue orders to respective officials to ensure the safety of his clients while in prison. The additional magistrate dismissed the request, clarifying that he did not have the authority to issue such orders.

        "date": "September 1, 2023 06:33 pm",
        "content": "Thailands king has commuted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatras eight-year prison sentence to one year, a day after the billionaire submitted a request for pardon. The partial pardon from King Maha Vajiralongkorn was confirmed by the official Royal Gazette with the announcement pointing to his service to the country as prime minister. Thaksin accepted his crime and showed remorse, the gazette said on Friday. He arrived on a private jet last week and was transferred to prison to serve an eight-year sentence. On his first night, he was moved to a police hospital because of chest pains and high blood pressure. The former leader, 74, returned to Thailand in a dramatic homecoming after spending 15 years abroad in self-exile to avoid prison on charges of abuse of power and conflicts of interest during his time in power. Thaksin was a prime minister, has done good for the country and people, and is loyal to the monarchy, the gazette said. He respected the process, admitted his guilt, repented, accepted court verdicts. Right now he is old, has illness that needs care from a medical professional, it read. His Majesty the King has granted him amnesty and reduced the sentence on Thaksin Shinawatra  so he could use his expertise and experience to develop the country further. Thaksin was twice elected prime minister and ousted in a 2006 military coup. Influential but divisive His homecoming coincided with his Pheu Thai party returning to government in alliance with pro-military parties, leading many to conclude an agreement had been struck to cut his jail time. Former telecoms tycoon and Manchester City owner Thaksin is one of the most influential but divisive figures in modern Thai history. Loved by millions of rural Thais for his populist policies in the early 2000s, he has long been reviled by the countrys royalist and pro-military establishment. Much of Thai politics over the last two decades has been coloured by the establishments efforts to keep Thaksin and his allies out of power. His supporters gave him a heros welcome on landing in Bangkok, and his first public act was to prostrate himself in homage before a portrait of the king at the airport. Hours later Pheu Thais Srettha Thavisin was confirmed as prime minister  the partys first premier since Thaksins sister, Yingluck, was ousted in a coup in 2014. Parties linked to Thaksin have dominated every Thai election since 2001  until this year when the progressive Move Forward Party (MFP) won the most seats. But the new coalition government has shut MFP out while bringing in parties linked to the coup-maker generals who ousted Thaksin and Yingluck, leading to anger from many Thais. It is his majestys grace that showed Thaksin mercy, Thaksins lawyer Winyat Chatmontri said, referring to the kings sentence reduction. Thais should accept and not criticise this outcome because it could be considered a violation of royal power, he added. Thailands strict royal insult law shields the monarchy from criticism, carrying a prison sentence of up to 15 years. Source - Al Jazeera - Agencies",

        "date": "September 1, 2023 08:51 pm",
        "content": "A Fundamental Rights (FR) petition has been filed before the Supreme Court, requesting a comprehensive investigation and a report on MP Namal Rajapakses alleged unsettled electricity bill adding up to Rs. 2.6 million. The relevant FR petition was filed by Attorney-at-Law E. J. Vijitha Kumara, with the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), its chairman N. S. Illangakoon, former CEB chairman Rakitha Jayawardena, Auditor General W. P. C. Wickremeratne, Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, MPs Namal Rajapaksa, and State Minister of Power and Energy D. V. Chanaka, amongst others being named as respondents. In his petition, Vijitha Kumara accused Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MP Namal Rajapaksa of having unsettled electricity tariffs to the tune of Rs. 2.6 million in arrears on an electricity bill related to his wedding reception in 2019. He further pointed out that MP D.V. Chanaka had requested then-Power and Energy Minister to provide a steady supply of electricity for the area from 12 - 15 September, following which, the minister had instructed the relevant CEB officials to do so, adding that the family would pay the bill at their convenience. Accordingly, the CEB had reportedly temporarily set up security lights and generators at former President Mahinda Rajapaksas residence in Weeraketiya on the aforementioned dates, 2019 at a cost of Rs. 2,682,246.57 and despite the repeated requests, the bill has not been settled yet, the lawyer emphasised in his petition. Citing the disparity over the fact that the power supply to his own house was cut off due to an outstanding bill of Rs. 7,390, the petitioning lawyer argued that this was a violation of fundamental rights as per Article 12 (1) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka. Thus, in his petition, he sought an order requesting the CEB to present the relevant file on the provision of electricity to the former Presidents house in Weeraketiya from 12  15 September before the court, while also seeking a declaration from the court that all relevant CEB officials, including its current and former chairmen had misused their privileges. Widespread speculations on the matter began circulating after Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) member Nalin Hewage disclosed the matter at a press conference held last month. Hewage said the CEB had provided him with this information in response to an inquiry he had made under the Right to Information (RTI) Act. Meanwhile, the accused SLPP MP responded to the widespread allegations, vowing to seek legal action against those who spread such rumors. In a letter directed to the Ceylon Electricity Boards chairman, the coordination secretary of the parliamentarian dismissed the allegations as defamatory and condemning.",

        "date": "September 1, 2023 08:57 pm",
        "content": "Addressing a Press conference held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), State Minister for Water Supply, Sanath Nishantha, provided an update on the progress and challenges faced in meeting the water supply needs of Sri Lankas population. Accordingly, State Minister Nishantha revealed that currently, efforts have been made to address 62 of the drinking water requirements across the island, while the ministry is also actively working towards achieving the goal of providing water supply to 85 of all requirements in the near future. Acknowledging the economic difficulties faced by the country, the State Minister emphasized the importance of using water sparingly, as the government has decided to raise water charges, emphasising that by conserving water, both the nation and its people can find some relief amidst existing economic challenges. The Presidents Media Division (PMD) said the following in this regard: Under the Ministry of Water Supply, three key institutions are operating: the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, the Water Resources Management Board, and the Community Water Supply Department. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board ensures the provision of high-quality water to the public, while 4,332 Community Water Societies cater to the water needs of 800,000 families who have limited access to Water. Another 1,000 new projects have also been implemented. Although the implementation of initial plans faced difficulties due to the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic challenges, the stabilization efforts led by the current President have allowed for a gradual resumption of activities. While several community water projects initiated in 2020 are nearing completion, the importation of 248 water pipe containers by the Water Supply Board faced temporary suspension due to financial constraints. However, discussions with the President and Finance Ministry officials have resulted in the gradual release of these containers from the port. To address the drinking water needs of the northern and eastern provinces, the installation of 400 nano water treatment systems has commenced, with 65 systems already completed and handed over to the public. Additionally, 70 of the drinking water requirements in Ampara and Trincomalee districts have been fulfilled. The Water Supply and Sanitation Improvement Project (WASSIP) is actively providing water to areas that cannot be served by both the Water Supply Board and the Community Water Supply Department. Currently, the program is being implemented in Kegalle and Nuwara Eliya districts. Efforts are also underway to construct salt barriers to prevent saltwater intrusion into rivers due to tidal conditions. Salt barriers have been completed for Ging Ganga, Nilwala Ganga, and Ma Oya, while construction has commenced for Kalu and Kelani rivers, utilizing technology from the Netherlands. The government has also taken steps to provide affordable water supply to urban slum dwellings, with a unit of 1000 litres previously priced at Rs. 60. Considering the production cost alone, the value is approximately Rs.86. However, when factoring in the debt burden of the Water Supply Board, the cost rises to Rs. 134. Despite this, the board is currently providing a unit of water for Rs. 116. In light of these developments, the Ministry of Water Supply urges the public to use this valuable resource sparingly, contributing to both national and personal savings.",

        "date": "September 2, 2023 09:47 am",
        "content": "Officers in South Africa have killed 18 suspected robbers during a shootout in Limpopo province, according to police. The suspects were believed to be planning a cash truck heist, also called a cash-in-transit (CIT) heist, and were responsible for similar crimes in other provinces, National Police Commissioner Fannie Masemola said on Friday from the crime scene in South Africas northernmost province. We do believe this syndicate has been involved in a number of CITs in this province, Mpumalanga and Gauteng, Masemola told reporters in Makhado, about 400km (250 miles) northeast of Johannesburg. One police officer was injured very seriously in the shootout, which lasted about 90 minutes, he added. According to police, who had been tracking the suspects movements for a few days, an investigation began in January with the help of the countrys intelligence unit. As soon as police approached the address, the group of suspects began shooting, police retaliated, the South African Police Service said in a statement. Sixteen males and two females were declared dead at the scene. Masemola told reporters that police intended to arrest them before they go out and commit the crime. High crime rate Cash truck heists happen regularly in the crime-ridden country. Last year, 10 suspects died during a cash-in-transit shootout with police after the would-be robbers fired at a police helicopter and wounded one of the pilots. In May, Police Minister Bheki Cele said there was a stubborn increase in cash-in-transit robberies of more than 20 percent with 64 cases reported during the first three months of the year. The crime statistics, which are presented by the minister every quarter in a live broadcast, have been steadily rising over the past few months in a country that has one of the highest crime rates in the world. Police have said they are clamping down on serious and violent crimes throughout the country. Four people found in another safe house were arrested in connection to the alleged cash truck robbery plan. Masemola said there was also an explosive that was ready to be used because they wanted to hit one of the cash depots in the province. He said the suspects planned to use an ambulance to transport the money to Gauteng province. Source: Al Jazeera -Agencies",

Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs  Constitutional Reforms Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry addressed the briefing. State Minister of Justice Anuradha Jayarathna, Foreign Secretary Aruni Wijewardane, Secretary Ministry of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms Wasantha Perera and Additional Solicitor General Nerin Pulle were associated with the briefing. At the outset, Minister Sabry recalled that the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) was amended in 2022 following extensive deliberations with all relevant stakeholders including the civil society, taking into consideration the constructive comments and concerns expressed by domestic and international stakeholders. Minister Sabry outlined the steps taken by the Sri Lankan government to ensure that the draft anti-terrorism legislation addresses national security requirements while upholding international standards and best practices. He highlighted the transparent and open consultative process that was followed in evolving the latest draft, including the consideration of views expressed by the public, civil society and international partners. The Minister informed that, following discussions on the suggested amendments, the Bill would be presented to the Cabinet for approval, and that once it is re-gazetted, any person will be able to petition to the Supreme Court with regard to the constitutionality of the Bill. Minister Rajapakshe briefed the participants on the initiative taken by the Justice Ministry to actively reach out to the public to receive further views, pursuant to the decision of the Cabinet. He said that concerns relating to the admissibility of confessions, detention orders and the definition of terrorism were considered during the deliberations. The minister explained how these concerns have been addressed in the draft legal framework. Additional Solicitor General Pulle presented the salient features of the draft legal framework and said that the Counter Terrorism Bill of 2018, the report of the Commission of Inquiry on Easter Sunday as well as the observations made by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) and the international community, were among the elements considered in developing the framework. He said the new draft seeks to ensure the protection of fundamental rights such as freedom of expression and will not include the death penalty, while judicial oversight will be ensured throughout detention. The draft Bill will be subject to the approval of the Cabinet and subsequent procedures as per the Constitution. Following the briefing, the members of the diplomatic corps engaged in a constructive discussion and appreciated the regular briefings to the diplomatic corps on relevant developments in Sri Lanka.",

        "content": "India launched its first spacecraft dedicated to studying the sun, building on a month of historic successes for the countrys civil space efforts. The spacecraft, called Aditya-L1, launched from Sriharikota, an island off the Bay of Bengal, at 11:50 a.m. Saturday local time (2:20 am ET). And its headed to a parking spot in orbit about 930,000 miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth. The successful liftoff of Aditya-L1 comes less than two weeks after Indias space agency, the Indian Space Research Organization, made history by landing its Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft on the lunar surface. The achievement made India only the fourth nation in the world  and the second in the 21st century  to land a vehicle safely on the moon. That mission is expected to conclude next week. Meanwhile, Aditya-L1 is heading for its destination at Lagrange point 1, an area that lies between the sun and Earth where the gravitational pull of both celestial objects cancel each other out. That location will allow Aditya-L1 to remain in orbit, in a position optimal for observing the suns activities, with minor fuel consumption. This position will provide a greater advantage of observing the solar activities and its effect on space weather in real time, according to the space agency. The spacecraft is equipped with seven scientific instruments, four of which will be trained directly on the sun while the others will study solar wind particles and magnetic fields passing through at Lagrange point 1. The main goals of the mission include studying the suns upper atmosphere and various solar phenomenon, such as coronal mass ejections  or massive expulsions of plasma from the suns outermost layer. The information gleaned from Aditya-L1s experiments will provide a clearer picture of space weather, or the term used to describe the magnetic waves rippling through our solar system. Space storms can have an impact on Earth when they reach our atmosphere, occasionally affecting satellites, radio communications and even power grids, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Indias Aditya-L1 will add to information gathered on other missions designed to study the sun, including NASAs ongoing Parker Solar Probe that in 2021 became the first spacecraft to touch the sun.

        "content": "Sri Lankas National Hydrogen Roadmap, which aims to develop and deploy green hydrogen technologies in the country, was unveiled on Friday (Sept. 01). Power  Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said the roadmap was presented by the Petroleum Development Authority of Sri Lanka (PADSL) and Greenstat Hydrogen India (a subsidiary of a Norwegian energy company with a specific focus on green hydrogen, solar, wind, and zero-emission maritime solutions) with the assistance of the USAID. Sri Lanka recognizes that green hydrogen offers a unique opportunity to tackle three significant socio-economic challenges: energy security and independence, energy affordability and equity, and environmental sustainability. Green hydrogen, produced using renewable energy sources like wind and solar power, offers a potential solution for significantly contributing to the transition towards a low-carbon economy, mitigate climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, by serving as a clean, efficient, and versatile energy source. Over the past five years, more than 30 nations have either developed or initiated the reparation of national hydrogen strategies. While climate goals pledged by these countries have been a principal driving force, geopolitical dynamics and unpredictable and fluctuating fossil fuel (coal, oil and gas) prices have also catalyzed the shift towards greener fuels, particularly green hydrogen. Along with the Offshore Wind Roadmap launched last week, Sri Lanka hopes to utilize the immense potential in renewable energy for green hydrogen transformation, Wijesekera said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).",

        "content": "A 58-year-old Tennessee woman has earned the title of the worlds longest competitive mullet for a female. Tami Manis, from Knoxville, sports a flowing mane that is 5ft 8in (172.72cm) - nearly the height of the average man. Ms Manis, a public health nurse, has had a mullet since the 1980s, inspired by a music video from American rock band Til Tuesday, and has not cut her hair in 33 years. Her hairstyle will be featured in the 2024 Guinness World Records book. Ms Manis said her mullet journey began when she first watched the music video for the song Voices Carry some four decades ago. The girl had a rattail and I really wanted one of those, she told the Guinness World of Records. She then cut her mullet off in November 1989 and immediately regretted it, so she began to grow it the following February and has not trimmed it since. A mullet is commonly referred to as being business in the front and a party in the back because of its short cut at the front, top and sides, and length in the back. It was the style du jour in the 1980s and early 1990s, made popular by stars like Billy Ray Cyrus, Mario Lopez and Patrick Swayze. Ms Manis said she catches most people by surprise who dont notice how long her hair is until she turns around. As for how she was able to grow it so long, Ms Manis credits her good genes. I also do a conditioner which has Argan oil in it, she said. But sporting a mullet that long isnt always easy. For one, Ms Manis hair is longer than she is, meaning she often keeps it braided so she can manage it. Before her World Record title, Ms Manis competed in the 2022 US Mullet Championships, where she finished in second place. Source - BBC - Agencies",

Speaking in this regard, Director General of Health Services (DGHS) Dr. Asela Gunawardena refuted recent media reports claiming that the bacterial infection had spread across the Colombo district, confirming that only two infections have been reported thus far, of which one was reported in Galle. Dr. Gunawardena explained that while one infection was reported from within the Galle Prison, the other infection was reported from Colombo. The second patient has been identified as a resident of Ja-Ela, and is currently receiving treatment at the Colombo national Hospital, Dr.Gunawardena said, further assuring that he is recovering well. Meanwhile, commenting on the recent death of a child at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital in Galle, Dr. Gunawardena stated that while it was suspected that the cause of death was meningococcal meningitis, subsequent tests confirmed that the child had not, in fact, contracted the infection. Speaking in regards to the meningococcal bacterial infection and the manners in which it spreads, microbiologist at MRI, Dr. Lilani Karunanayake explained that the bacteria most often spreads through saliva and phlegm. More often than not, it spreads amongst those who are in close proximity to each other. It is more likely to spread within a household than within the community as a whole. While meningitis is a complication of symptoms, it is also possible for one to develop complications such as pneumonia and sepsis, she said, in this regard, further assuring that the infection has been categorised as an endemic disease, and not an epidemic.",

On August 28, the Cabinet of Ministers gave the nod to import 92 million more eggs to Sri Lanka from India for 3 months in a bid to further stabilize the prices. Drawing attention to this, Minister Amaraweera said the government would be compelled to import chicken from India if the meat prices were not reduced. The minister pointed out that despite the country being self-sufficient in eggs and chicken meat production, the soaring prices are making it difficult to meet the countrys protein requirements, thus emphasizing that reducing egg and chicken prices is a must.",

Accordingly, the Jaffna, Mannar and Mullaitivu districts formed the countrys second Coconut Triangle, which was officially launched at a ceremony held at the Palai Coconut Model Garden in Jaffna. Sri Lankas coconut export revenue has significantly increased in recent years. Owing to the wide range of benefits associated with Sri Lankan coconuts, an evident increase in demand has been observed, thus, this year, it is anticipated that exports of coconut-based goods will bring in a total of USD 700 million. Meanwhile, it is anticipated that exports of goods related to coconuts would generate a revenue of USD 2 billion over the next ten years. The move to develop a second Coconut Triangle was fueled by the fact that local consumption accounts for two thirds of coconut production., while only one third is used for export. Thus, in order to increase export potential, this situation needs to be altered, which initially prompted the development of the novel Coconut Triangle.",

        "date": "September 3, 2023 12:10 pm",
        "content": "The crushing economic crisis in Sri Lanka last year has left more than half of the islands population multidimensionally vulnerable, according to a national citizens survey led by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The study spanning the years 2022 and 2023 and covering 25,000 households across the country, found 55.7  of the population to be vulnerable across three dimensions  education, health and disaster, living standards  and 12 indicators, including school attendance, physical condition of health, unemployment and indebtedness. In effect, the survey showed that 12.34 million people out of Sri Lankas 22.16 million-strong population have been badly affected by the crisis and remain vulnerable amid claims of a recovering economy. The findings are in line with earlier research by UN agencies on food insecurity levels and reaffirm anecdotal accounts of poor families cutting down their food intake and pulling their children out of school to cope with the high living costs. The findings of UNDPs study carried out in partnership with the Citra Social Innovation Lab anchored at the Prime Ministers office, assume significance, especially after the government rejected a UNICEF report that pointed to high malnutrition levels among Sri Lankan children last year. Notably, the recently launched UNDP report said a majority, or 82 , of those found to be multidimensionally vulnerable lived in rural Sri Lanka. It underscored the need for more policy focus in those areas. Further, the study found a third of the countrys population gets into debt for essential needs like food, medical care, education, and pawning jewellery or selling items. Several districts, including Ampara, Batticaloa, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Nuwara Eliya, Puttalam, and Vavuniya, exhibit notable multidimensional vulnerability values, with over 65 percent of their populations identified as vulnerable, the report said, indicating that people living in the islands Tamil-majority north and east, impacted by the civil war, and the economically-marginalised Malaiyaha Tamil community, are among those facing the highest levels of economic deprivation. Capital Colombo and the neighbouring Gampaha districts emerged as regions with the highest concentration of vulnerable individuals, a trend that the study attributed to their substantial population sizes. Road to recovery Last years financial meltdown pushed Sri Lanka to bankruptcy and brought its citizens to the streets as they contended with acute shortages, long power cuts, and a dramatic increase in prices. A year after defaulting on its foreign debt in the wake of a stifling balance of payments problem, the government obtained International Monetary Fund (IMF) support in March 2023 by way of a  3 billion package to be disbursed over four years. While President Ranil Wickremesinghe has pledged to set the countrys economy on a path of recovery, his government is struggling to reach an agreement with its external creditors. Colombo must finalise a debt treatment plan before the IMFs scheduled review this month, as the second tranche of the IMF loan is contingent on it. Further, the government recently announced its decision to restructure its domestic debt, mainly by recasting the outgo on the countrys pension funds. Worker unions have been fiercely opposing the move. In a recent letter to the IMF, more than 80 Sri Lankan organisations and trade unions said subjecting workers pension funds to domestic debt restructuring will diminish the returns to wage-earners and deplete the fund to half its current value. Your debt restructuring program is crippling working people in Sri Lanka who run our economy and create value in our society. The economic reforms you have imposed on us, without reflecting on the negative consequences of the previous reforms enacted over 16 IMF interventions, are crushing our economy, they told the Fund. Meanwhile, Central Bank data showed a further slowdown in headline inflation in August, dropping to 4  from 6.3  recorded last month. Still, the numbers are yet to translate to relief for most citizens, especially because of last years exceptionally high base effect, even as incomes have remained stagnant. The government  in adherence to the IMF programme  recently began making cash transfers to 1.5 million families out of the 2 million it has identified as poor and eligible. Many more families are protesting, asking to be included on the list. However, womens groups and government critics argue that a targeted social security programme, amounting to 0.6 of the GDP, will prove grossly inadequate to combat the severe economic strain many face.

        "content": "Sri Lankas President Ranil Wickremesinghe says he appreciates Japans leadership in international efforts to restructure his countrys external debt. Sri Lanka fell into default in April last year after fiscal policy decisions triggered a rapid depreciation of its currency and high inflation. Wickremesinghe assumed power in July last year amid political upheaval. In an interview with NHK, Wickremesinghe said everyone is comfortable with Japan serving as co-chair of a new international framework launched in April aimed at resolving Sri Lankas debt crisis. Japan regards Sri Lanka as an important partner in its effort to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific. China also considers Sri Lanka as a partner in its Belt and Road initiative. It has been giving loans to the South Asian country. In 2017, the management of a port in the south of the country was handed over to a Chinese firm on a 99-year lease after debt was not repaid. The incident is widely viewed as an example of debt trap diplomacy. Wickremesinghe said China unfortunately lacks agencies like the Japan International Cooperation Agency to handle debt issues. He emphasized that the Sri Lankan government controls security of the port operated by the Chinese company. He noted that there have been port calls there by Japans Maritime Self-Defence Force vessels. Source: NHK Japan --Agencies",

Addressing a virtual event to launch the policy report Understanding Multidimensional Vulnerabilities: Impact on People of Sri Lanka prepared by the UNDP, he welcomed efforts taken to address interference on the work of the Central Bank via the passing of the New Central Bank Act. I am not talking about the last 5, 6 or 10 years. Over the last 75 years we have regressed. And the main source for this regression has been macro-economic stress in my view. Commenting further, Dr. Coomaraswamy emphasized that the main cause for these macro-economic issues has been the governments fiscal operation, adding that the negative effects of that has been amplified by fiscal dominance in monetary policy. They have been interference in the work of the CBSL from time to time, he stressed. However, he also mentioned that he is pleased to see the new Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act and the tight fiscal operations currently underway within the country. I am pleased to see that some of that, pretty much of all of that is now been rolled back, he added. Meanwhile, the former CBSL chief alleged that in the past, nobody has taken interest on macro-economic issues, except to complain. All are complaining on the depreciated exchange rates, higher interest rates and the increasing inflation, he said, adding that nobody asks the question why is this happening. This is another part of the governance failure. Its not the governance failure only on the politicians but the entire country. Nobody takes enough interest in these issues. Furthermore, Dr. Coomaraswamy claimed that all the depreciated exchange rates, higher interest rates and increasing inflation are symptoms only, mentioning that all the people have to look at the causes of these issues and exert pressure for those causes to be addressed.",

        "date": "September 3, 2023 10:19 pm",
        "content": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated that the India has been greatly sensitive to the needs of Sri Lanka, during the tough times faced by the island nation. We have also been greatly sensitive to the needs of our valued neighbour, Sri Lanka, during their tough times, he said, during an interview with the Indian news agency PTI. Meanwhile, the Indian PM also pointed out that the debt crisis is a matter of great concern for the world, especially developing countries, as India looks at building consensus at the upcoming G20 summit to evolve a tangible framework to help the debt-ridden low income economies. In an exclusive interview to PTI late last week, Modi said Indias G20 presidency has placed a significant emphasis on addressing the global challenges posed by debt vulnerabilities, especially for nations in the Global South. The debt crisis is indeed a matter of great concern for the world, especially developing countries. Citizens from different countries are keenly following the decisions being taken by governments in this regard. There are some appreciable results too, Modi said. First, countries that are going through debt crisis or have gone through it, have begun to give greater importance to financial discipline, Modi said. Second, others who have seen some countries facing tough times due to the debt crisis are conscious of avoiding the same missteps, Modi said. Under its G20 presidency, India has been consistently highlighting the need for a framework on debt restructuring to help countries facing mounting debt problems. China, considered to be the worlds largest sovereign creditor, has been showing reluctance to certain proposals on debt restructuring although an increasing number of G20 member countries are pitching for helping the low-income nations deal with the crisis. According to estimates, over 70 low-income countries are reeling under a collective debt burden of 326 billion. The G20 finance ministers and Central Bank Governors have acknowledged the good progress in debt treatment of common framework countries and beyond the common framework too, Modi said. We have also been greatly sensitive to the needs of our valued neighbour, Sri Lanka, during their tough times, he said. To accelerate global debt restructuring efforts, the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable, a joint initiative of the IMF, World Bank and the G20 Presidency was launched earlier this year. This will strengthen communication among key stakeholders and facilitate effective debt treatment, he added. Modi hoped that rising awareness among the people of different countries on the problem will ensure that such situations dont recur often. While a lot is being done to address these issues, as I said earlier, I am positive that rising awareness among the people of different countries will ensure that such situations dont recur often, he said. In July, IMF Chief Kristalina Georgieva pitched for a speedier debt restructuring process for vulnerable countries. India is hosting the G20 summit on September 9 and 10 in its capacity as the current chair of the grouping. The G20 member countries represent around 85 percent of the global GDP, over 75 per cent of the global trade, and about two-thirds of the world population. The grouping comprises Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the UK, the US and the European Union (EU). --Agencies",

        "date": "September 4, 2023 12:17 pm",
        "content": "Thousands of people remain trapped at the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert after heavy rains inundated the area and created thick, ankle-deep mud which sticks to campers shoes and vehicle tires. Attendees were told to shelter in place in the Black Rock Desert and conserve food, water and fuel after a rainstorm swamped the area, forcing officials to halt any entering or leaving of the festival. A little over 70,000 people, remained stranded Saturday, Sgt. Nathan Carmichael, with the Pershing County Sheriffs Office, told CNN Sunday morning. Some people have left the site by walking out but most of the RVs are stuck in place, he said. On Sunday morning, event organizers said roads remained closed as they were too wet and muddy and more uncertain weather was likely on the way. While some vehicles were able to leave, others got stuck in the mud, organizers said on the events website. Please do NOT drive at this time, they added. We will update you on the driving ban after this weather front has left the area. The remote area in northwest Nevada was hit with 2 to 3 months worth of rain  up to 0.8 inches  in just 24 hours between Friday and Saturday morning. The heavy rainfall fell on dry desert grounds, whipping up thick, clay-like mud festivalgoers said was too difficult to walk or bike through. A death at the festival that was confirmed by authorities on Saturday was unrelated to the weather, Burning Man organizers said Sunday night. Emergency personnel responded to a call for service regarding a 40-year-old man Friday but could not resuscitate him, organizers said, without providing further details. The Pershing County Sheriffs Office earlier said it is investigating the death. Playa is the term used to describe sunken dry lake beds in deserts where water evaporates rather than running off, and even a small amount of rain can quickly soak a large area. The rainy conditions forecast over the area for Sunday afternoon had mostly passed to the east of the festival site, according to a social media post from organizers, though there is still a chance of showers and thunderstorms for the rest of daylight hours into the evening. Event organizers announced earlier Sunday plans to burn the Man  the huge totem set on fire at the festivals culmination  on Sunday night if weather allowed. However, the burn was rescheduled for Monday night due to rain and muddy conditions Sunday, and an inability to move heavy equipment and fire safety onsite, organizers said. How long this could last Authorities have not provided information on when roads could reopen, but the sunshine is expected to return Monday. We do not currently have an estimated time for the roads to be dry enough for RVs or vehicles to navigate safely, Burning Man organizers said in a Saturday evening statement. Monday late in the day would be possible if weather conditions are in our favor. It could be sooner. Organizers noted the rain falling on an already saturated playa overnight and Sunday will affect the amount of time it takes for the playa to dry. For now, the gate and airport into Black Rock City remain closed and no driving is allowed into or out of the city except for emergency vehicles, the organizers said on social media. Black Rock City is a temporary metropolis erected annually for the festival and comes complete with emergency, safety and sanitary infrastructure. The rain made it virtually impossible for motorized vehicles to traverse the playa, the Pershing County Sheriffs Office said, noting people were advised to shelter in place until the ground has dried enough to drive on safely. Vehicles trying to drive out will get stuck in the mud, Burning Man organizers said Saturday. It will hamper Exodus if we have cars stuck on roads in our camping areas, or on the Gate Road out of the city, the organizers added. If you are in BRC, please shelter in place  stay safe, organizers said. Storms and heavy rains across Nevada flooded other parts of the state and may have led to another death. In Las Vegas, authorities found a person unresponsive and entangled with debris, on Saturday morning who is believed to be a drowning victim, according to Jace Radke, a spokesperson for the city. An investigation is ongoing, Radke said in a news release. Difficult conditions, but some stay positive Some festivalgoers hiked miles on foot in the thick mud to reach main roads while others stayed at their camps, hoping for conditions to improve. Hannah Burhorn, a first-time attendee at the festival, told CNN people were trudging through the mud barefoot or with bags tied around their feet. People who have tried to bike through it and have gotten stuck because its about ankle deep, Burhorn said. The mud is so thick it sticks to your shoes and makes it almost like a boot around your boot, she added. Its unclear exactly how many people are stranded at the festival, but typically more than 70,000 people attend the weeklong event. Its being held from August 28 to September 4 this year. There werent any reports of injuries as of Saturday afternoon, Sean Burke, the director of emergency management for Pershing County, told CNN. Amar Singh Duggal and his friends managed to leave the festival after hiking about 2 miles in the mud, he told CNN. He estimated it took them about 2 hours to get to a main road where they arranged to be picked up and taken to Reno, about a 120-mile drive from the event grounds. We made it, but it was pure hell (walking) through the mud, Duggal said. Each step felt like we were walking with two big cinder blocks on our feet. Among those attending the festival was DJ Diplo and comedian Chris Rock. Rock posted a video on Instagram of thick mud and Diplo posted a series of videos in which he said a fan offered him and Rock a ride out of the site. The DJ said they walked several miles and were able to get to a nearby airport. Meanwhile, attendees who typically dedicate their time to making art and building community are now also focused on rationing supplies and dealing with connectivity issues. There is super limited bandwidth and a lot of people at the camp (are) trying to cancel flights and arrange for extended time here due to the weather, Burhorn told CNN via text message from a Wi-Fi camp. Still, the poor conditions have not stopped the creativity, said Burhorn, who had traveled from San Francisco. People are building mud sculptures, she said. Andrew Hyde, another attendee stuck at the Burning Man, said despite the muddy conditions making it difficult to walk, the weather has taken the meaning of the event back to its roots. You come out here to be in a harsh climate, and you prepare for that, Hyde told CNNs Paula Newton. So in many ways, everybody here just kind of made friends with their neighbors and its a community event. Morale at the event is OK and theres generally no panic among the attendees, Hyde said, describing music returning overnight. There are worries about the additional rain causing delays, however, and the unknowns of worsening conditions. I think the concern is if we have another rain, he said. People need to go back to their jobs, back to the responsibilities they have back home. Assistance brought in Organizers announced Saturday night theyll be putting mobile cell trailers in different positions, configuring the organizations Wi-Fi system for public access and deploying buses to nearby Gerlach to take people who might walk off the playa to Reno. This is not likely a 24-hour operation at this time, the festival said in a statement on its website. Organizers are also resourcing four-wheel-drive vehicles and all-terrain tires to help ferry medical and other urgent situations to the blacktop. There have been people who managed to walk to a main road and were waiting for transport from the festival organizers Saturday night, the Pershing County Sheriffs Office said. Resources have been brought in from around northern Nevada to help people with medical needs on the event grounds, the sheriffs office said. Burning Man is a community of people who are prepared to support one another, Burning Man said on its website. We have come here knowing this is a place where we bring everything we need to survive. It is because of this that we are all well-prepared for a weather event like this. We have done table-top drills for events like this, organizers added. We are engaged full-time on all aspects of safety and looking ahead to our Exodus as our next priority. Source  CNN --Agencies",

        "date": "September 4, 2023 03:04 pm",
        "content": "The future of millions of children is at risk as growing numbers are pulled out of school and into work, the head of the United Nations labour body has told the BBC. Gilbert Houngbo, director-general of the International Labour Organization (ILO), said there had been a regression in regions around the world amid global economic problems. Some of the worst forms of work involved sexual exploitation. He said urgent action was needed. Compound the Covid effect with the rise in inflation and the cost of living that followed and it has just made things worse, he said. Unless we act now and we act decisively and fast, the problem will continue to worsen. Data compiled by the UN in early 2020 found that some 160 million children were being subjected to child labour, and that global progress to end it had stalled for the first time in 20 years. Mr Houngbo, the former prime minister of Togo, said early data suggested the trend was continuing. He said a squeeze on living costs - driven in part by rising food and energy prices caused by the war in Ukraine - had for some families made the difference between having one meal a day or not. In some cases this had led to the worst form of child labour, where parents were pushing their children into sex work to help support their families. In the coastal city of Mombasa in south-eastern Kenya, one 14-year-old girl told the BBC she had no choice but to look for work as her mother struggled to afford food and school fees for her and her two siblings. To make money, she said she had been sleeping with men, washing clothes and plaiting hair. When she does attend school, she said she sometimes feels so hungry that she cant get the pen to write. Speaking from their small home, her mother said it was not easy to tell a child to do something like that. But she said she was unable to support her family after losing her job during the pandemic, and now struggled to make ends meet washing clothes. It is very heart breaking. I would like my child to go to school like other children so that she can get a good job that will help her in the future, but because I dont have any means she is forced to do that job. A woman running a nearby brothel said her business was thriving as she was getting more and more young girls desperate for money. Mr Houngbo said the rise in child labour was being seen in low- middle- and high-income countries, and in sectors including agriculture, mining and construction. Clearly we are in a critical moment, he said, adding that poverty is the root cause. The exact circumstances in different countries vary, but the UN childrens fund (Unicef) says inflation and the rising cost of living are a universal concern that impacts children in a range of ways. Many families out of desperation need to resort to really impossible choices and negative coping strategies that are affecting children now and in the long-term, said Natalia Winder-Rossi, director of Unicefs social policy and social protection programme. The BBC has visited several countries to see how economic problems are affecting children. In the southern Lebanese city of Sidon, children said they had dropped out of school to support their families. When I was at school I used to dream of becoming a teacher. Now I stopped dreaming, 14-year-old Alaa, who works cleaning peoples houses, told the BBC. Unicef says more than one in 10 families in Lebanon send their children to work. The country is facing an almost total collapse of its economy. I would like to go to school of course, but in this situation who would think of going to school? You need to provide for your family. Im suffocating... but I have to put up with it, said 15-year-old Muhammad, who sells tissues in the road to passing cars. But Mr Houngbo said that while the situation was very worrisome, he remained optimistic that solutions could be found. He said there was no one size fits all approach, but policies focusing on education, creating jobs, and cracking down on illicit industries were among the actions that could be taken. Governments needed to step up now, he said. Source - BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "Microsoft is no longer updating WordPad and plans to remove the word processor from a future release of Windows. The software giant will instead recommend Microsoft Word, its paid word processor that has always been far more feature rich than the basic WordPad app that has shipped as part of Windows since Windows 95. WordPad is no longer being updated and will be removed in a future release of Windows, reads a support note published by Microsoft on Friday. We recommend Microsoft Word for rich text documents like .doc and .rtf and Windows Notepad for plain text documents like .txt. News of the WordPad removal comes just a day after Microsoft revealed its upgrading Notepad with features like autosave and automatic restoral of tabs. Microsoft updated its Windows Notepad app in 2018 for the first time in years and went on to add tabs to the Windows 11 version. WordPad hasnt had the same amount of attention, though. The word processor was updated with Windows 7s Ribbon UI, but after a slight Windows 8 redesign it hasnt had any major additions. Microsoft will now remove WordPad entirely in a future release of Windows, which will most likely be the Windows 12 version were expecting to see in 2024 with plenty of AI-powered features.

        "date": "September 4, 2023 04:27 pm",
        "content": "A group of men who say they were sexually abused by a Japanese boy band producer expressed hope Monday that the company will provide financial compensation and introduce measures to prevent a recurrence. They say producer Johnny Kitagawa sexually preyed on young dancers and singers for decades, having them stay at his luxury home, handing them cash and leveraging promises of potential fame. The company, Johnny  Associates, is a powerful force in Japans entertainment industry. The men said at a news conference Monday that they have been ignored for decades by the company, Japanese society and mainstream media. Company Chief Executive Julie Keiko Fujishima released a brief statement on YouTube in May about the accusations but has not appeared before reporters. The company has set a news conference for Thursday. We want Julie to apologize, as the chief executive and company owner, said Shimon Ishimaru, one of nine men who have formed a group demanding an apology and compensation from the company. For a company behind this big a crime to do nothing is unimaginable. Johnnys, as the company is known, is family-run and not publicly listed. Kitagawa, Fujishimas uncle, died in 2019 and was never charged. A special team set up by the Tokyo-based company recently spoke to 23 accusers, but has said the total will likely balloon to at least several hundred people. The team also recommended Fujishima resign. Junya Hiramoto, another member of Ishimarus group, said they hope to set an example for others who have suffered. Our wounds never fade, Hiramoto said. Do you think we arent still hurting? Do you think we can forget? Do you know what its like for us to come forward like this, filled with shame? Over the years, persistent allegations against Kitagawa have generally been dismissed as malicious rumors. Mainstream media stayed silent. The U.N. Working Group on Business and Human Rights has urged the Japanese government to act to make sure that Johnnys provides an apology and compensation and that government oversight of businesses be improved. The government has yet to take action. Japan tends to be behind the West on issues of gender equality, childrens rights and awareness about sexuality. It was only after a BBC documentary about Kitagawa aired this year that the scandal again became a topic of scrutiny. Another accuser, Kauan Okamoto, spoke at the Foreign Correspondents Club in April, saying he trusted foreign media more than Japanese media. Okamoto, like many others who have come forward, was part of a backup boys group called Johnnys Jr. The Associated Press does not usually identify people who say they were sexually assaulted, but Kitagawas recent accusers decided to be named publicly in news accounts.

        "date": "September 5, 2023 12:49 am",
        "content": "(AP)  A Malaysian court on Monday dismissed 47 corruption charges against Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi after prosecutors unexpectedly dropped the charges at an advanced stage of his trial. Zahid said the High Court approved the prosecutors application for a dismissal but refused to grant him a full acquittal, which means he can still be recharged. But he said he was grateful that the politically motivated accusations against me have ended. Zahid heads the United Malays National Organization, and his support has been pivotal in helping Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim form a unity government after last Novembers general election led to a hung Parliament. Zahids dismissal sparked new criticism and further hurt the anti-corruption stance of Anwars government. Opposition leaders have alleged that Zahid supported Anwar so the charges against him could be dropped. Mondays court ruling came just weeks after local elections in which the Islamist-Malay nationalist opposition bloc made further inroads in government-ruled states. Lead prosecutor Mohamad Dusuki Mokhtar was quoted by the New Straits Times as saying that the charges against Zahid were temporarily halted to prevent any miscarriage of justice. He said Zahid raised new issues and evidence in an appeal to the Attorney-Generals Chambers for the charges to be dropped. That included claims that his case had been rushed through and that he was a victim of selective prosecution by the previous government. Dusuki said further investigations would be carried out by the anti-graft agency. Zahids lawyer, Hisyam Teh Poh Teik, said the defense will apply for a full acquittal. The dismissal came despite the courts ruling in January 2022 that prosecutors had proven a case against Zahid and ordered him to enter his defense. Critics slammed the prosecutions move to withdraw the charges. Former lawmaker and civil society reformist Maria Chin said it was a sad day for democracy because the dismissal was tantamount to saying corruption is OK. Opposition lawmaker Wan Saiful Wan Jan said it destroyed Anwars credibility as a reformist, and accused the premier of being willing to do anything to stay in power. Zahid, 70, was charged after the long-ruling UMNO-led coalition lost the 2018 general election because of public anger over corruption. Then-Prime Minister Najib Razak was charged in several graft cases and is serving a 12-year jail term after losing a final appeal in one of the cases. Zahid faced 12 counts of criminal breach of trust, 27 counts of money laundering and eight counts of bribery involving more than 31 million ringgit (6.7 million) from his family foundation. More than 110 witnesses have testified. Prosecutors alleged that money intended for charity was misappropriated for his personal use, including to pay off his credit cards and for shopping.

Accordingly, the court has determined that the Inland Revenue Amendment Bill can be passed by a simple majority of the legislature. The Supreme Court has held that neither the bill which was challenged in the court nor any of its provisions is inconsistent with Article 12 of any provisions of the constitution, the Speaker added. Last week, the Supreme Court concluded the deliberations of the petitions filed challenging the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Draft Bill, which was presented to the Parliament by the government. The petitions had been filed by two persons including Chaturanga Abeysinghe, an activist of the National Peoples Power (NPP), alleging that if passed in Parliament, the proposed bill will revise a number of levies and will also further empower the Inland Revenue Department as the primary agent for collecting taxes and dealing with issues arising with taxes on behalf of the government.",

        "date": "September 5, 2023 10:59 am",
        "content": "US First Lady Jill Biden tested positive for Covid-19 Monday, the White House announced. This evening, the First Lady tested positive for COVID-19. She is currently experiencing only mild symptoms. She will remain at their home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, the first ladys spokesperson Elizabeth Alexander said in a statement. President Joe Biden, 80, tested negative, according to the White House. An administration official told CNN Monday that there are no changes to White House Covid protocols or to the presidents schedule at this time. The diagnosis of the first lady, 72, comes amid a busy week for Joe Biden, who delivered a Labor Day speech in Philadelphia earlier in the day. The president is scheduled to present the Medal of Honor to an Army captain in a White House ceremony Tuesday before departing for the G20 Summit in India on Thursday. CNN has asked for more details on both the president and first ladys regular Covid testing cadence and if Joe Biden was with his wife when she began exhibiting Covid symptoms. Last summer, the first lady tested positive for Covid-19 while vacationing in South Carolina in August. President Joe Biden tested positive last July. Both experienced rebound cases shortly after being treated with Paxlovid. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters in July in the White House briefing room that anyone who meets with the president is still tested for Covid-19 before their meeting after members of Israeli President Isaac Herzogs delegation tested positive ahead of a bilateral meeting. We have testing protocols when  anytime somebody meets with the president, Jean-Pierre said at the time. So, I can tell you that anybody who meets with the president does indeed get tested. I do. We all do. Jill Bidens diagnosis comes amid renewed attention to Covid-19 as the world approaches the fourth virus season since the coronavirus arrived on the scene. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data from earlier in the summer showed a slight increase in hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and positive Covid-19 tests  although not nearly as high as in past summers. Overall, there were about four new hospital admissions for every 100,000 people nationwide in the week ending August 19, which is considered low, according to CDC thresholds. Seven counties had high levels of Covid-19 hospitalizations. But 117 counties  about 3.6 of the country  were in the medium threshold. About a quarter of those counties were in Florida. A new variant, BA.2.86, has captured scientists attention because its highly mutated, but so far its only been detected in a small number of people globally. Nonetheless, it doesnt look good  in terms of the virus nonstop evolution, Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist at the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said. The virus keeps finding new ways to challenge humans, to find new hosts and repeat hosts, and its relentless. Source - CNN - Agencies",

        "date": "September 5, 2023 11:36 am",
        "content": "Investors have been allowed to purchase 200 electric buses for operation in the Western Province, Minister of Transport, Highways and Mass Media Dr. Bandula Gunawardena said. Speaking at a press conference held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Monday (04 Sep.), the Minister highlighted that this program will be implemented in accordance with the world agreement where all public transportation worldwide will be free from fossil fuels by 2030. Accordingly, he stated that an Expression of Interest (EOI) has been called for the project, allowing investors to import 200 electric buses for the Western Province, while also enabling them to establish charging points. Below is the full speech delivered by Dr. Bandula Gunawardena; Investors have been allowed to import 200 electric buses for the Western Province. For this project, Expression of Interest has been called. It will be implemented as a domestic and foreign joint venture. Also, the investors have been allowed to establish charging points. The investor would be allowed to operate the project to recover the invested capital. Thereafter, within a certain period, the ownership of the buses will be acquired by the government. Any country in the world including China and Korea could apply for this project. This is an investment opportunity. There is a global consensus that all public transport in the world should reach zero emission by 2030. Those involved in carbon trading are investing in this to protect the ecosystem. Electric buses bring great value to the environment. Various organizations in the world are paying a high price to protect this value. Also, all government institutions should be digitized to prevent decrease in income. A cabinet paper has been presented to replace issuance of tickets with electronic cards. When you transact using advanced technology such as card or QR system instead of cash, you could increase the income of each of these institutions by at least 50. Institutions such as the Inland Revenue Department, Customs, Excise Department, Railways, Sri Lanka Transport Board, etc. can be rebuilt through modern technology. Without it, the government cannot bear the burden. Many changes have been made to the railway system. A shipment of rail tracks has been brought to the port after 4 years under the loan assistance of the Asian Development Bank. The railway line from Colombo to Panadura is in a state of dilapidation. Coastal railway tracks need to be replaced at least every 5 years. As a result of the dilapidated railway lines, the trains have to run at a reduced speed, causing delays for commuters who have to report for duty on time. Therefore, the restoration work of the railway track from Colombo to Panadura will commence within the next few days. The northern railway line was temporarily closed since January to upgrade the tracks from Anuradhapura to Kankasanthurai. Further upgrades are scheduled on this northern track from Mahawa to Anuradhapura in January 2024. Once these upgrades are completed, trains on the northern track would be able to operate at a speed of 100km per hour from Colombo to Kankasanthurai. A loan agreement is to be signed under Indian loan assistance for the modernization of the signalling system. A renovation process to increase the speed by removing the speed limits of the Kelanivalley railway line will commence from the first week of this month. If a train carriage is imported from abroad, it costs Rs. 200 million. A Sri Lankan entrepreneur refurbishes a train carriage for Rs. 25 million. Accordingly, it is hoped that the existing railway carriages will be renovated through the upcoming budget. Employees are impressed with our program. The trade unions are now supporting us. We also get their support in dealing with polluters. I appeal to the trade unions not to inconvenience passengers in order to achieve their demands. In the event there are issues that affect them, it could be discussed with the relevant officials where a solution could be found.",

        "title": "International rights groups slam Sri Lankas flawed plans for a Truth Commission",
        "date": "September 5, 2023 12:36 pm",
        "content": "Nine international human rights organizations including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch (HRW) say that there are grave reservations about the Sri Lankan governments proposed National Unity and Reconciliation Commission. Issuing a joint statement titled Sri Lankas Flawed Plans for a Truth Commission in this regard, they point out that their concerns echo many of those already raised by victims of conflict-related abuses and their families. The statement claims that Sri Lanka has a long history of convening similar bodies, none of which has provided justice, truth or reparation to the many people who have engaged with them, adding that the latest initiative risks repeating the mistakes of the past, exposing victims to renewed security threats and re-traumatization without any realistic chance of a different outcome. There have not been any genuine confidence-building measures or steps to ensure a safe and conducive environment for such a commission to function effectively. There has been no meaningful consultation, including with affected communities, it said. In addition, they highlight in the statement that as set out in reports to the United Nations Human Rights Council, existing domestic transitional justice mechanisms such as the Office of Missing Persons are unable to function effectively, and there are ongoing attempts to block prosecutions of crimes under international law. The Sri Lankan government should approach transitional justice as a holistic process that includes truth-seeking, investigation and prosecution of international crimes, and effective remedies such as reparations, redress and guarantees of non-recurrence. Any successful transitional justice process requires inclusive consultation with stakeholders, including with victims and civil society organizations, and substantial confidence-building measures to ensure that victims can participate without fear. It must have credibility among affected communities, the statement asserted. Furthermore, they highlight that according to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, numerous commissions of inquiry appointed by successive governments failed to credibly establish truth and ensure accountability. The joint statement, which underscores multiple legacy of failed commissions, also noted that there is no indication in the governments current proposals for a National Unity and Reconciliation Commission, or in the manner and circumstances in which it is being established, to suggest that it will be willing or able to provide truth, justice or reparation where previous commissions have failed. Many victims and their relatives have already engaged in multiple similar processes over decades. The current proposals risk further re-traumatization, with little expectation that victims rights and needs will be addressed, it added. The statement further mentions that; The lack of a conducive environment or confidence-building efforts: In the Northern and Eastern Provinces, which were the most affected by the armed conflict, victims of gross human rights violations such as enforced disappearances and unlawful killings and their families, as well as human rights defenders and activists, face routine surveillance, harassment and intimidation by government security and intelligence agencies. There are severe restrictions on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, freedom of expression, freedom of association, and political participation. Draconian laws  notably the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), which has facilitated torture and other ill-treatment and arbitrary detention, especially of members of minority communities  remain in use. The proposed new anti-terrorism law if enacted as it is currently formulated would retain and even extend many of the PTAs abusive powers. In the north and east, several state agencies are engaged in a campaign of land grabs targeting the property and the religious sites of minority communities. In this environment, it is not possible to conduct a credible truth-seeking process in which communities that have faced discrimination and violence for decades can participate with confidence and in safety. Meanwhile, in July this year, the government appointed retired admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne as High Commissioner to Pakistan, despite a court order for his arrest in connection with the emblematic Navy 11 case in which victims were kidnapped for ransom, tortured and killed. This is indicative of the governments efforts to ensure impunity for those suspected of criminal responsibility for crimes under international law and gross human rights violations, many of whom continue to hold senior official positions. A lack of meaningful consultations: If any future truth-seeking mechanism is to earn the trust of victims and their families, many of whom have lost faith in domestic institutions, it is necessary for the government to hold meaningful consultations and take steps to address their concerns. Instead, hurried meetings hosted by the Foreign Ministry in July this year involved select civil society groups and trade unions but excluded key victim and stakeholder groups, further increasing distrust between the state and victims. A victim-centric approach, where all stakeholders are involved in the formation of institutions to address past violations, is essential to ensure that any mechanism will achieve its goals. The Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms carried out comprehensive consultations in 2016 and produced a report with recommendations. We deplore the failure to adopt or otherwise take into account those recommendations during the current process. The failure of domestic institutions: Existing transitional justice bodies, such as the Office on Missing Persons, and the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation, have achieved little or nothing nearly five years since they were established. They have been widely rejected among victim communities. In October 2022, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights told the Human Rights Council, the Office on Missing Persons and the Office for Reparations  the only two (out of four) transitional justice structures established  have failed to achieve the tangible results expected by victims and other stakeholders. International involvement: In a recent media interview, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said the proposed commission would have foreign observers. However, the involvement of international observers in previous commissions did not make them credible or effective. The International Independent Group of Eminent Persons (IIGEP) was appointed in 2006 to act as observers to the Udalagama Commission. They resigned citing a conflict of interest in the proceedings of the commission, a lack of effective victim and witness protection, a lack of transparency and timeliness in the proceedings, a lack of co-operation by state bodies, and a lack of financial independence of the commission. The Paranagama Commission also had an advisory council of international experts, whose role and terms of reference were unclear, and who made no substantial contribution to the commissions mandate to investigate cases of enforced disappearances. In light of these experiences, the inclusion of foreign observers alone is no guarantee of an effective process, which requires other issues raised by victims to be meaningfully addressed. Blocking prosecutions: We are concerned by the Presidents remarks that any parallel criminal investigations may undermine the work of the new commission. This is especially concerning given Sri Lankas position at its recent Universal Periodic Review by the UN Human Rights Council, where the government rejected recommendations by states to end impunity for human rights violations, abuses and harassment, especially against members of ethnic and religious minority communities, by holding those suspected of criminal responsibility to account before ordinary civilian courts, including security forces and government officials. Truth commissions should not be instituted as an alternative to criminal investigations and prosecutions aimed at establishing individual criminal responsibility for crimes under international law. Any credible truth-seeking mechanism should have the power to refer crimes under international law for prosecutions before the civilian courts. The United Nations Human Rights Council, in its resolution on Sri Lanka of 6 October 2022, emphasized the importance of a comprehensive approach to dealing with the past, incorporating judicial and non-judicial measures, to ensure accountability, to serve justice, to provide remedies to victims, to avoid the recurrence of violations of human rights, and to promote healing and reconciliation. Furthermore, the relevant international human rights organizations urge the government of Sri Lanka to fully engage with the victims of human rights violations and their families, deliver a transitional justice process that upholds their rights and abides by Sri Lankas obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law and demonstrate its commitment to providing truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence by immediately ending human rights violations against victims families and communities. It also seeks the Sri Lankan government to uphold its legal obligation under international law to appropriately prosecute those suspected of criminal responsibility for crimes under international law and gross human rights violations. Moreover, they request the other states, particularly members of the UN Human Rights Council, and those in a position to influence the Sri Lankan government, to call for an end to ongoing violations and for substantive confidence-building measures to ensure that victims be able to participate in any future reconciliation and accountability process safely and with confidence. Foreign governments and the United Nations should engage with any future process in a manner that is transparent, upholds principles of international law, and makes the concerns of victims and their families the priority. Following decades of abuses, some of which continue to this day, the Sri Lankan government needs to take urgent and meaningful steps to earn victims confidence, it concluded. The relevant statement has been jointly issued by nine international human rights organizations; the Amnesty International, Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development, Franciscans International, Front Line Defenders, Human Rights Watch, International Commission of Jurists, International Federation for Human Rights, International Working Group on Sri Lanka and the Sri Lanka Campaign.",
