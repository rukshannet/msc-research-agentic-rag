https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/15/meta-faces-whatsapp-instagram-break-off-risk/,2025-04-15,Meta faces WhatsApp & Instagram break off risk,"Meta Platforms Inc. faces a historic antitrust trial beginning Monday that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses.

The looming antitrust trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump's Federal Trade Commission's ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta -- then called Facebook -- in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.

Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, ""expressed in 2008: 'It is better to buy than compete.' True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.""

Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and ""neutralize perceived competitive threats,"" the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.

""Unable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company's executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,"" the FTC says.

Facebook bought Instagram -- then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following -- in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.

Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller ""acqui-hires"" -- a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.

WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.

""The FTC already has the difficult task, whether it's looking at 10 years ago or five years ago or today, of trying to define what is the market we're talking about in a sufficiently narrow way that it can show Meta has a ton of power in that market,"" said Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. ""And I do think that challenge has gotten harder as the years have gone by and we see more and more potential competitors in social media spaces.""

Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC's lawsuit ""defies reality.""

""The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission's action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,"" the company said in a statement.

In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC ""must prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past."" This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram.

Meta's fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta's request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial.

Boasberg ""seems to be skeptical"" of the FTC's narrow market definition in his rulings to date, Swanson said. He added that the judge also said it is a ""fact question,"" which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market.

While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it's forced to spin off Instagram.

""Instagram is now Meta's biggest money maker in the U.S., its most lucrative market, where the app accounts for 50.5% of the company's ad revenues in 2025. Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,"" said Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. ""The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn't where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets.""

But Meta isn't the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google's case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August.

""A big theme here is we are applying 19th-century laws to 21st-century markets. And I think it's an open question whether the judgment developments to antitrust law can keep up with markets as they are changing -- these fluid and dynamic tech markets in particular,"" Swanson said. ""And this will be a case that speaks directly to that."" (ABC News)"
https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/15/trumps-tariffs-hit-pakistan-hard-as-economic-worries-grow/,2025-04-15,Trump's Tariffs Hit Pakistan Hard as Economic Worries Grow,"The recent introduction of new U.S. tariffs under former President Donald Trump's 2025 ""economic nationalism"" policy is already affecting global trade flows. While the policy is primarily aimed at imports from countries like China, Vietnam, and other Asian economies, the effects are being felt more broadly. One of the countries experiencing indirect consequences is Pakistan, which is already managing a challenging economic environment.

Although trade between the U.S. and Pakistan is relatively limited compared to other partners, Pakistan's textile industry stands to be among the most affected. Textiles are Pakistan's largest export to the United States, with annual exports exceeding USD 4 billion. These products are now facing a 29% tariff under the new trade measures. Industry representatives warn that this could increase costs, reduce price competitiveness, and impact the country's ability to maintain its share in the U.S. market.

A representative from the Sindh Industrial Trading Estate in Karachi noted that such tariffs could disrupt the economy, especially given the country's ongoing currency pressures and trade deficits. Pakistani officials have also expressed concern over the lower tariffs granted to India and the possibility of a bilateral trade agreement between India and the U.S., which could provide a competitive advantage to India in the long run.

Pakistan must also compete with other textile-exporting countries in the region--including Bangladesh, Vietnam, and India--to maintain and expand its market share. As the government seeks to manage these challenges, it is evaluating the broader economic impact of the tariffs, particularly while under a loan program supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

One of the more indirect impacts of the U.S. trade policy has been seen in the disruption of supply chains. Pakistan's textile and surgical instrument sectors, for example, rely on imported raw materials from countries now subject to high U.S. tariffs. This dependency has raised production costs, extended delivery timelines, and led to a reduction in orders from major U.S. retailers.

Pakistan's exports--60% of which are textiles--are sensitive to such global shifts. The textile sector depends on inputs like cotton from India, synthetic yarn from China, and machinery from Southeast Asia. As global companies adjust their sourcing strategies, many Pakistani manufacturers are facing growing uncertainty.

In the first quarter of 2025, Pakistan's current account deficit increased to 4.5% of GDP, driven in part by a drop in export earnings and fluctuations in currency value. The Pakistani rupee has come under pressure, and the central bank has used foreign exchange reserves to stabilize it. However, this approach may not be sustainable due to limited fiscal capacity.

There is also growing concern about increased economic reliance on China. Pakistan is already closely tied to China through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and other financial agreements. As Western markets become less accessible, Pakistan may become more dependent on Beijing, limiting its ability to navigate international partnerships independently.

Some Pakistani trade experts believe the tariff could be inconsistent with World Trade Organization (WTO) principles, which encourage resolving trade disputes through multilateral dialogue. Pakistan is considering filing a complaint with the WTO's dispute settlement body, although officials continue to emphasize the importance of diplomatic solutions over retaliatory measures.

Certain voices in Pakistan have proposed tariffs on American imports, similar to strategies adopted by other countries. Reports suggest that China may be encouraging Pakistan to adopt a firmer stance. However, such a response could complicate efforts to improve U.S.-Pakistan relations under the current U.S. administration. In light of these developments, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's government has formed a steering committee and a working group to assess the issue and explore diplomatic and economic strategies.

Sajid Amin, an economist at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), pointed out that the immediate effects will be challenging, particularly as the U.S. remains Pakistan's largest trading partner. He mentioned that the government may consider supporting local producers to improve competitiveness, but doing so could face restrictions under the IMF's USD 7 billion loan program.

Business journalist Khurram Husain noted that the tariffs could shift U.S.-Pakistan trade relations toward a more transactional nature. He added that while exploring new markets is necessary, it will take time to build strong alternative trade relationships.

During the first seven months of fiscal year 2025, Pakistan's exports to the U.S. reached USD 3.6 billion--19% of the country's total exports--with 79% comprising textile and apparel products. Pakistan's export base remains heavily concentrated, with the U.S., China, and the U.K. making up over 30% of its total exports. From the U.S. perspective, imports from Pakistan represent only 0.16% of total U.S. imports, but the trade volume is significant for Pakistan.

As Pakistan navigates this shifting trade landscape, addressing structural economic vulnerabilities, enhancing export diversification, and fostering new international partnerships will be critical to mitigating the long-term effects of the new U.S. tariffs. (Khaama Press)"
https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/15/apple-india-produces-22-billion-of-iphones-in-a-shift-from-china/,2025-04-15,Apple India produces $22 billion of iPhones in a shift from China,"Apple Inc. assembled $22 billion worth of iPhones in India in the 12 months ended March, increasing production by nearly 60% over the previous year in a sign of continued diversification away from China.

The Cupertino, California-headquartered company now makes 20%, or one in five, of its prized iPhones in the South Asian country, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified as the information isn't public. The dollar figure represents the devices' estimated factory gate value, rather than the marked-up retail price.

The ramp-up suggests the iPhone maker and its suppliers are accelerating a pivot to India from China, a process it began when harsh Covid lockdowns hurt production at Apple's largest plant. The bulk of India-made iPhones are assembled at Foxconn Technology Group's factory in southern India. Tata Group's electronics manufacturing arm, which bought Wistron Corp. and controls Pegatron Corp.'s operations, is also a key supplier.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment outside of regular business hours.

Of the total India production, Apple exported 1.5 trillion rupees ($17.4 billion) in iPhones from the region in the fiscal year through March 2025, the nation's technology minister said on April 8.

Shipments of iPhones from India to the US accelerated after President Donald Trump announced his plans for the so-called ""reciprocal"" tariffs in February, the people said. Apple's average India production and exports surged all through the fiscal year to March.

Apple will increasingly prioritize iPhones from the India supply chain for its US customers, Bloomberg News reported previously.

The Trump administration late Friday exempted electronics goods including smartphones and computers from its reciprocal tariffs. That's good news for companies such as Apple and Nvidia Corp., though the reprieve doesn't appear to extend to Trump's separate 20% duty on China, applied to pressure Beijing to crack down on fentanyl.

This also means iPhones made in India will not attract any duties as of now. Barring the exceptions made Friday, Trump's cumulative levies on China remain at 145%, and will likely force companies such as Apple to intensify their supply chain shift.

But with nearly 200 suppliers and an overwhelming reliance on China, moves to other countries could take years to play out. Despite Trump's ambition to have iPhones made in the US, Apple is unlikely to move production there any time soon due to factors including a shortage of facilities and labor needed to produce the devices.

Apple's Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has often praised China's high-level of skill in making its marquee devices. In 2022, Bloomberg Intelligence estimated it would take eight years to move just 10% of Apple's production capacity out of China.

Apple now assembles its entire iPhone range in India, including the more expensive titanium Pro models. Its manufacturing success in the world's most populous nation is also helped by state subsidies tied to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambition to turn the country into a manufacturing hub.

Modi is also seeking to widen electronics component manufacturing with $2.7 billion in new financial incentives, and is focused on advancing its semiconductor ambitions.

Apple has a nearly 8% market share in India's smartphone market, where its sales -- a bulk of those from iPhones -- reached almost $8 billion in fiscal 2024. (Economic Times)"

The system made by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) tracked the drone, fired a laser beam and destroyed the target.

This platform is a game-changing one for India's armed forces as drone warfare is increasingly being used in modern combat, such as the war in Ukraine.

""CHESS DRDO conducted a successful field demonstration of the Land version of Vehicle mounted Laser Directed Weapon(DEW) MK-II(A) at Kurnool today. It defeated the fixed wing UAV and Swarm Drones successfully causing structural damage and disabled the surveillance sensors. With this successful trial country has joined the exclusive club of the Global powers who possess the high power Laser DEW System,"" the DRDO said in a post on X.

The success puts India in the exclusive group of nations with high-power Laser-DEW.

""As far as I know, it is the United States, Russia and China that have demonstrated this capability. Israel is also working on similar capabilities, I would say we are the fourth or fifth country in the world to demonstrate this system,"" DRDO Chairman Samir V Kamat told news agency ANI.

Mr Kamat said this is just the ""beginning of the journey"", adding DRDO is working on a number of technologies ""that will give us Star Wars capability.""

""This is just the beginning of the journey. The synergy that this lab has achieved with other DRDO labs, industry and academia, I am sure we will reach our destination soon... We are also working on other high energy systems like high energy microwaves, electromagnetic pulse. So we are working on a number of technologies that will give us Star Wars capability. What you saw today was one of the components of Star Wars technologies,"" Mr Kamat said.

The indigenously designed and developed Mk-II(A) DEW system was demonstrated in its entire spectrum of capability by engaging fixed-wing drones at long range, thwarting a multiple drone attack and destroying enemy surveillance sensors and antennae.

The lightning speed of engagement, the precision and the lethality delivered to the target within a few seconds made it the most potent counter drone system.

DRDO's Centre for High Energy Systems and Sciences (CHESS), Hyderabad, developed the system along with LRDE, IRDE, DLRL and academic institutions and Indian industries.

Once detected by a radar or by its inbuilt electro optic (EO) system, the laser-DEW can engage targets at the speed of light and use an intense beam of powerful light (laser beam) to cut through the target, leading to structural failure or more impactful results if the warhead is targeted.

This type of cutting-edge weaponry has the potential to revolutionise the battlespace by reducing reliance on expensive ammunition while also lowering the risk of collateral damage.

The proliferation of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and the emergence of drone swarms as asymmetric threats are driving the demand for directed energy weapons with counter-UAS and counter-swarm capabilities.

The DEW will replace traditional kinetic weapons and missile defence systems due to its ease of operation and cost-effectiveness. The requirement for cost-effective defence solutions to offset the low-cost drone attacks is driving the adoption of DEWs by military organisations worldwide. (NDTV)"

Bezos's fiancee Lauren Sanchez, a US author and philanthropist, also joined the passengers on board the flight, which blasted off from western Texas at around 8:30 am (1330 GMT). The flight took around 10 minutes and the rocket returned safely to the ground by parachute.

The remaining crew included TV presenter Gayle King, film producer Kerianne Flynn, former NASA aerospace engineer Aisha Bowe and Amanda Nguyen, founder of a campaign group against sexual violence.

King's close friend, talk show legend Oprah Winfrey, was among those watching the launch in Texas.

""It's oddly quiet when you get up there... you look down at the planet and think, 'That's where we came from?' And to me it's such a reminder about how we need to do better and be better,"" King said.

Monday's venture features the first all-woman space crew since Russian cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova's historic solo flight in 1963.

10-minute flight to the edge of space

The passengers were carried more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) above the Earth's surface -- beyond the Karman line, the internationally recognized boundary of space.

The fully automated craft rose vertically before the crew capsule separated in mid-flight, before returning to the ground in a fall braked by parachutes and a retro rocket.

Perry, known for hits such as ""Firework"" and ""California Gurls,"" and her co-passengers had the chance to experience weightlessness for a brief period during the trip.

""I feel super connected to love,"" Katy Perry said after landing back on Earth. She was holding a daisy flower, which she took into space, to remind her of her daughter, Daisy.

Ahead of the trip she told Elle magazine that she was going on the trip for Daisy, whom she shares with actor Orlando Bloom, ""to inspire her to never have limits on her dreams.""

""I'm just so excited to see the inspiration through her eyes and the light in her eyes when she sees that rocket go, and she goes back to school the next day and says 'Mom went to space,'"" Perry added.

Delivering a special statement, Ranil Wickremesinghe said the government must consider this an urgent matter and brief the nation on what measures are being taken by the authorities in this regard.

The former President said even though the imposition of tariffs has been postponed now, it will become effective as this period ends, pointing out that it is a major issue if Sri Lanka is paying between 25%-30% in tariffs.

""One main impact is the loss of jobs, which some say could be around 100,000. This will also have an impact on Sri Lanka's economy. We must face this issue,""  Ranil Wickremesinghe said.

He further said that Sri Lanka cannot consider that the tariffs have been removed, but should use this opportunity to hold talks with other nations, especially to address the China issue.

Ranil Wickremesinghe noted that the tariffs will also impact Sri Lanka's loan repayments.

""This will cause a significant gap between repayments and the funds to be received by Sri Lanka. We will see a reduction in the funds disbursed to us. As such, this will increase our loan amounts. As a result, we are expected to pay UD$ 300 million for this quarter. The value of the Rupee has dropped due to this crisis. We have to face these issues,"" he said.

The former President said the government must work towards the 2028 loan repayment goal and that the government must see if the target could be met.

Udaya Gammanpila, the counsel representing Pillayan, said that the order signed by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) is concerning unlawful activity connected to aiding and abetting the kidnapping of a person.

Speaking to the media, Udaya Gammanpila said in no way does the order say the arrest and detention of Pillayan is connected to the Easter Attacks.

The former Parliamentarian also pointed out that Pillayan could not have been privy to information related to the Easter Attacks, as he had been detained from 2015 to 2020.

""As such, if anyone says Pillayan is the mastermind of the Easter attacks, it is a joke. The Public Security Minister on 10th April claimed in Parliament that Pillayan has revealed details regarding the Easter attacks. On 12th April, the President said a person from Batticaloa had been arrested in connection with the Easter attacks. However, when I visited Pillayan on 13th April, it was evident that this man has not spoken a single word about the attacks, as claimed by the government,"" Udaya Gammanpila said.

The former Parliamentarian said it is evident that Pillayan had no way to know about the Easter Attacks as he was in remand custody before and during the attacks.

Providing details on representing Pillayan as his lawyer, Udaya Gammanpila said he made the decision after being informed that Pillayan's lawyers had been denied access to meet him.

Udaya Gammanpila said Pillayan's lawyer, his friend, had informed him that his juniors had been denied access to Pillayan by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) when they had attempted to meet him on 09 April 2025.

""After this, I met Pillayan's family and obtained the necessary details. I then contacted the Director General of the CID via telephone and informed her that Pillayan's family and lawyers had been denied access to him, which was a violation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). I also informed her that as I am now Pillayan's counsel and need to meet him, will I be given permission?"" he said.

Gammanpila said that upon being informed by the CID Director General to make the request in writing and doing so, he was granted permission to meet Pillayan.

""However, four Police officers were present during our meeting, which is not the ordinary practice during such instances. A meeting between a lawyer and his detained client should be confidential. But, despite requesting the Police officers to leave us alone, they rejected the request and remained present during our meeting,"" he said, revealing details of the meeting.

Udaya Gammanpila also said that Pillayan had broken down crying, questioning if he was being penalised for helping the country defeat the LTTE at the risk of his life and for how many more years he was going to be detained.

Former State Minister Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan, widely known as 'Pillayan', was detained for 90 days under the Prevention of Terrorism Act on 12th April 2025 after being arrested by the CID in Batticaloa on 08th April.

The detention is in connection with the 2006 abduction and disappearance of a university vice chancellor in the Eastern Province. (Newswire)"

The team, consisting of Bilaal Marikar and Januda Perera, was trained by Senuri Silva, Head of the Mediation Program at the Moot Court Bench (MCB).

The BM ICCC is one of the most distinguished International Client Consultation Competitions held annually, attracting participants from universities worldwide. It brings together participants from numerous countries to showcase and develop their skills in client counselling and problem-solving.

Recognised as the leading international platform for testing client consultation abilities, participants are selected through competitive national rounds to represent their respective countries on the global stage. The BM ICCC aims to provide law students with valuable opportunities to learn and practice interviewing and counselling which are essential, real-world skills that are often underemphasized in traditional legal education.

To enable sustainable and effective participation at the BM ICCC by Sri Lanka, the BM ICCC Board of Directors has appointed Mr. Shanaka Cooray, Attorney-at-Law, MCIArb as the 'BM ICCC National Representative for Sri Lanka' and The Moot Court Bench (MCB) as the 'Official National Facilitator for the BM ICCC in Sri Lanka.'

The BM ICCC was held from the 9th to the 12th of April 2025, at University of Glasgow School of Law, Scotland, United Kingdom, which saw the participation of 22 teams from around the world. The Sri Lankan team advanced to the semi-finals, competing alongside teams from Canada, Australia, England, Scotland, Poland, the USA, New Zealand, and the Netherlands. After several rigorous rounds, Sri Lanka emerged as the winner of the Competition.

This achievement marks a significant milestone, as it was the first time a team trained by the MCB participated in the Competition. This stands as a testament to the team's dedication and hard work, as well as the quality of mentorship and guidance they received. Looking ahead, the MCB aspires to expand its impact by offering structured support and training to Sri Lankan students in the field of client counselling, extending its efforts beyond purely this Competition.

This victory adds to a series of notable achievements by the MCB in 2025. The MCB-trained team which took part in the 28th International Chamber of Commerce International Commercial Mediation Competition (ICC Paris) held in Paris, France, in February this year performed exceptionally well, securing a Special Award for the third year running. In early April, the MCB-trained team which took part in the Willem C. Vis (East) International Commercial Arbitration Moot Court Competition held in Hong Kong, emerged quarter-finalists of the Competition while also securing an Honourable Mention for Best Oralist.

The Moot Court Bench (MCB) started in 2020 with the aim of institutionalizing the training process for teams representing Sri Lankan Universities at the Willem C. Vis International Commercial Arbitration Moot Competition, both in Vienna and Hong Kong. Since then, the MCB has expanded into an organization dedicated to developing legal advocacy skills among the law students of Sri Lanka through Programs catering specifically to the fields of Arbitration, Mediation, and Trade Law."

President Mohamed Muizzu signed the legislation on Monday after it was passed by the People's Majlis, the Maldivian parliament.

Muizzu's cabinet initially decided to ban all Israeli passport holders from the idyllic island nation in June 2024 until Israel stops its attacks on Palestine, but progress on the legislation stalled.

A bill was presented in May 2024 in the Maldivian parliament by Meekail Ahmed Naseem, a lawmaker from the main opposition, the Maldivian Democratic Party, which sought to amend the country's Immigration Act.

The cabinet then decided to change the country's laws to ban Israeli passport holders, including dual citizens. After several amendments, it passed this week, over 300 days later.

""The ratification reflects the government's firm stance in response to the continuing atrocities and ongoing acts of genocide committed by Israel against the Palestinian people,"" Muizzu's office said in a statement.

Gaza's health ministry said on Sunday that at least 1,613 Palestinians had been killed since 18 March, when a ceasefire collapsed, taking the overall death toll since Israel's war on Gaza began in October 2023 to 50,983.

The ban goes into immediate effect.

""The Maldives reaffirms its resolute solidarity with the Palestinian cause,"" the statement added.

Last year, in response to talk of a ban, Israel's foreign ministry advised its citizens against travelling to the country.

Chequered history

The Maldives is an Islamic republic made up of 1,129 islands. It is considered one of the world's premier beach vacation destinations, known for its coral reefs, white sandy beaches and picturesque lagoons.

This isn't the first time the Maldives has issued a travel ban on Israelis. The Maldives recognised Israel and established diplomatic relations after Israel became the third state to recognise the island nation in 1965 - but those were suspended in 1974.

A ban on Israeli tourists from a previous era was lifted in the 1990s, and in 2009, Maldives and Israel signed several cooperation agreements to improve relations. However, in 2018, under new leadership, those agreements were severed, and the two countries have had rocky relations since then.

In 2024, the country took in nearly two million tourists, with the top five arrivals from China, Italy, India, Russia, and the United Kingdom. Most tourist arrivals come from Europe (54 percent), and Asia and the Pacific are in second place with 35 percent of all arrivals.

According to the Maldives Ministry of Tourism, 528 Israelis visited the country in the first quarter of 2024, down 89 percent from 4,644 in the first quarter of 2023.

According to government data, over 200,000 tourists visited the Maldives this February, 59 of whom were Israeli. (Middle East Eye)"

The judges of the national superior court found that Humala and Heredia received several million dollars in illegal contributions for these campaigns from Odebrecht and the government of the then Venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez.

The verdict makes Humala the third former Peruvian president to be imprisoned for corruption in the last two decades. He joins Alejandro Toledo, sentenced in 2024 to 20 years for Odebrecht-related crimes, and Alberto Fujimori, who received multiple convictions for corruption and human rights abuses.

The trial began in 2022, and alongside the 62-year-old former military officer and his 48-year-old wife, the court convicted eight others. Both Humala and Heredia were held in pre-trial detention from 2017 to 2018 at the prosecutor's request to prevent their flight.

Odebrecht's 2016 admission of widespread bribery across Latin America preceded the initial investigations against Humala, which started in 2015, a year before the company's revelations.

Most of the presidents who have governed Peru since 2001 have faced legal problems due to their connections with Odebrecht. Toledo is currently imprisoned, while the former president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, is under house arrest. Alan García, who served two non-consecutive terms, died by suicide in 2019 as authorities moved to arrest him in connection with Odebrecht bribes.

In addition to former presidents, prominent figures such as the former presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori and numerous ex-governors are also under investigation. (The Guardian)"

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/17/kaspersky-reports-2024-financial-results-with-record-revenue/,2025-04-17,Kaspersky reports 2024 financial results with record revenue,"Kaspersky today announces its financial results for 2024, throughout which the company showed robust performance, marked by an 11-percent increase in sales, which hit an all-time record and amounted to USD 822 million.

In 2024, Kaspersky increased its business prosperity by further enhancing its solution portfolio and growing its business in markets with favorable environments. Notwithstanding the geopolitical climate and resulting constraints, Kaspersky showed a positive growth dynamic and elevated its financial results to record heights, further developing its leading corporate cybersecurity solutions and remaining a major consumer protection provider.

Kaspersky's business growth was to a large extent prompted by its B2B business success: the company's global B2B sales grew by 19% year-on-year (YoY), where both enterprise and SMB sales showed double-digit growth -- 21% and 17%, respectively. Kaspersky's corporate sales were driven by both endpoint (+26% YoY) and non-endpoint solutions (+12% YoY) growth, with the share of non-endpoint solutions prevailing and accounting to 53%.

2024 also marked the presentation of the company's new flagship product line, Kaspersky Next. The portfolio combines robust endpoint protection with the transparency and speed of EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) alongside the visibility and powerful tools of XDR (Extended Detection and Response), giving a further boost to the company's B2B ecosystem sales. Kaspersky Next XDR Expert, which became available for early adopters in 2023, generated a 100% increase in sales in 2024.

Kaspersky's key solutions to protect businesses from the most sophisticated attacks, like next-generation AI-powered SIEM Kaspersky Unified Monitoring and Analysis Platform and comprehensive anti-APT solution Kaspersky Anti Targeted Attack Platform, saw significant sales increases with +39% and +18% YoY respectively. In 2024, Kaspersky SIEM received enhanced functionality, designed to bolster the productivity of cybersecurity teams by expanding the capabilities for threat detection and response.

Kaspersky Security Services also performed strongly over the past year: Kaspersky Incident Response sales rose by 20% YoY, while SOC Consulting and Kaspersky Compromise Assessment services increased by 105% and 271% YoY, respectively. The sales of Kaspersky Managed Detection and Response solution, which last year was crowned as one of the Champions among the industry's leading MDR providers by SoftwareReviews, went up by 18% YoY.

Additionally, Kaspersky continued driving the development of its innovative solutions, having presented a new version of Kaspersky Thin Client and launched Kaspersky Appicenter, a content distribution platform for devices based on KasperskyOS, an operating system with innate protection. The sales of products based on KasperskyOS**** grew by 84% YoY in 2024.

The year was also remarkable for the company's B2C business, which showed positive business dynamic in a number of regions, in particular, LatAm (+6%YoY), the META region (+20%YoY), and Russia, Central Asia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)*** (+26%YoY). The overall B2C sales result demonstrated a slight decrease of 2% YoY in sales, prompted by geopolitical influence.

In 2024, Kaspersky persisted in enhancing its B2C portfolio and, in particular, upgraded its iOS and Android mobile apps to provide a higher level of protection, increased privacy, and improved usability for a smooth user experience. The company's products for end users continued to receive praise from independent analyst agencies: Kaspersky Standard, the primary Kaspersky consumer portfolio plan, has been honored with the annual Top-Rated Product Award by AV-Comparatives for high results across the whole series of consumer product tests in 2024.

Andrey Efremov, Chief Business Development Officer at Kaspersky, commented: ""Kaspersky's record-breaking revenue in 2024 is the strongest validation of our strategy -- a clear signal that we have both the capability and the momentum to outperform the market and deliver on our long-term vision. This milestone fuels us to go further: extending our technological leadership and expertise, and innovating to be ahead of tomorrow's threats today. Our results reinforce our mission to deliver world-class protection, anticipate evolving attack vectors, and expand our portfolio to meet -- and exceed -- our customers' expectations.""

The strong business results were also steered by the sales of solutions that appeared in the company's portfolio just recently: Kaspersky SD-WAN, a solution for geo-distributed businesses to build fault-tolerant and secure networks with unified management, and Kaspersky Cloud Workload Security, a multi-layered threat protection solution, designed specifically to address security risks in cloud workloads and comprising of two products, Kaspersky Hybrid Cloud Security and Kaspersky Container Security.

As the company increased its sales and diversified its product range, it continued to prioritize technological innovation by consistently submitting its products for independent comparative evaluations. In 2024, Kaspersky has also maintained its status of the most tested and most awarded cybersecurity company.

Committed to a collaborative approach in tackling global cybercrime, last year, Kaspersky continued growing its network of partners and signed an agreement with AFRIPOL to facilitate cooperation and threat intelligence data sharing with the law enforcement agency. In addition, Kaspersky kept advancing its Global Transparency Initiative, as part of which the company allows partners and customers to review the source code of its products, threat detection rules, and antivirus builds. Last year, Kaspersky opened new Transparency Centers in Turkey, South Korea, and Colombia, and renewed the SOC 2 audit.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/17/recent-cybersecurity-incidents-dta-highlights-risk/,2025-04-17,Recent cybersecurity incidents : DTA highlights risk,"In light of recent cybersecurity incidents that have garnered significant public attention, the Digital Trust Alliance (DTA) has reaffirmed its commitment to fostering a resilient and ethically governed digital ecosystem in Sri Lanka.

Issuing a statement, DTA said these developments serve as a stark reminder of the complex and evolving nature of cyber threats, underscoring the urgent need for organisations to embed Digital Trust at the heart of their corporate governance and strategic planning.

As part of its regular industry deliberations, the DTA Board convened recently to reflect on the broader implications of such incidents for Sri Lanka's public and private sectors. The discussions centred around the critical intersection between cybersecurity, consumer confidence, and organisational accountability.

-Protecting Digital Trust: Beyond Compliance to Strategic Readiness

Cybersecurity incidents, irrespective of sector, highlight the fragile nature of Digital Trust and the significant responsibility entrusted to organisations that manage customer data. While technical defences are essential, the DTA emphasises that building Digital Trust requires a holistic approach encompassing:

-Elevating Industry Readiness: DTA's Strategic Focus Areas

The DTA will continue to collaborate with like-minded industry associations, regulatory bodies, and professional networks to:

The DTA will lead efforts to create media reporting guidelines on data breaches. These guidelines aim to ensure accuracy, responsible terminology, and ethical reporting standards during cybersecurity incidents. Furthermore, the DTA is prepared to engage in capacity-building programs for journalists covering technology and cybersecurity.

DTA will work with industry partners to provide strategic advisory services for boards and senior leadership on embedding Digital Trust as an enabler of business objectives. This includes incident response readiness, reputational risk management, and executive education on governance in the digital age.

Recognising that restoring Digital Trust post-incident extends beyond technical remediation, the DTA offers guidance on managing the full lifecycle of a cybersecurity incident -- from detection and response to recovery, stakeholder engagement, and trust rebuilding.

-A Call to Action for Sri Lankan Enterprises

This moment is a critical inflexion point for Sri Lanka's digital economy. It is imperative that organisations assess their cybersecurity readiness, strengthen their governance practices, and embed Digital Trust principles into their operational DNA.

The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) and emerging regulatory frameworks provide an important foundation. However, the DTA believes that policy must be complemented by organisational maturity, investment in security talent, and a culture of transparency and ethical stewardship of data.

DTA states, moving forward, it remains steadfast in its mission, advocating for a resilient, secure, and trusted digital Sri Lanka. (Newswire)

The now 40-year-old doctor, who worked in the palliative care team of a nursing service, is alleged to have acted out of malice and other base motives.

What do we know about the case?

According to the public prosecutor's office, the doctor is alleged to have killed a total of 15 patients cared for by the nursing service between September 2021 and July 2024.

The man allegedly administered an anesthetic induction drug and then a muscle relaxant to his patients without medical necessity or their knowledge and consent. The latter was said to have led to paralysis of the respiratory muscles, resulting in respiratory arrest and death within a few minutes.

In some cases, the suspect allegedly set fire to his victims' homes to cover up his actions.

The victims were reportedly between 56 and 94 years old.

The accused has been in custody since August 2024 and has not yet commented on the charges. Prosecutors are seeking a lifelong professional ban for the suspect who had been active as a medic in several German states.

During the course of the investigation, the public prosecutor's office also ordered exhumations with investigations reportedly still ongoing in some cases. An investigative team is also evaluating the doctor's patient records for more evidence.

The man -- not officially named in line with German privacy laws -- initially came under suspicion over four deaths last year, after he allegedly torched the victims' homes.

The death toll could still rise, even after investigators uncovered more possible victims dating back to 2021. (DW)"

The Postal Trade Unions Front reveals that this new digital payment for traffic fines was introduced when the Postal Department had already introduced a new SMS notification system for individuals paying police fines at post offices.

Stating that this system was proposed to be developed to notify the respective traffic police officer and the individual who paid the fine via SMS, the trade union claimed that it was not implemented due to a lack of response from the Police Department.

The trade union revealed it was not opposed to the use of technology and urged the government to launch the SMS fine system designed by the Postal Department, warning that a revenue loss could directly impact the Treasury.

As the GovPay online traffic fine payment system has been introduced as a pilot programme, the trade union urged the government to revise and integrate its SMS fine system. (Newswire)"

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/18/us-issues-new-sanctions-targeting-chinese-importers-of-iranian-oil/,2025-04-18,US issues new sanctions targeting Chinese importers of Iranian oil,"The United States on Wednesday issued new sanctions targeting Iran's oil exports, including against a China-based ""teapot"" oil refinery, as President Donald Trump's administration seeks to ramp up pressure on Tehran.

""Teapot"" is an industry term for small independent oil refiners.

The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement the action would increase pressure on Chinese importers of Iranian oil as Trump seeks to restore his ""maximum pressure"" campaign on Iran, which includes efforts to drive its oil exports down to zero.

The action comes as the Trump administration has relaunched negotiations with Iran over its nuclear programme this month, with talks in Oman last weekend and a second round expected in Rome this weekend.

The Treasury on Wednesday said it imposed sanctions on a China-based independent teapot refinery it accused of playing a role in purchasing more than $1 billion worth of Iranian crude oil. It was the second small independent Chinese refinery hit with sanctions by the Trump administration so far.

The United States has not in the past focused on Chinese teapot refiners in part because they have little exposure to the U.S. financial system. Chinese state-run oil firms have stopped buying Iranian crude, on concerns of running afoul of sanctions.

Washington also issued additional sanctions on several companies and vessels it said were responsible for facilitating Iranian oil shipments to China as part of Iran's ""shadow fleet.""

Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, called on the U.S. to immediately stop its ""unwarranted suppression"" of Chinese entities and individuals.

""China will take necessary steps to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,"" Liu said in a statement.

Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York and China's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

China does not recognize U.S. sanctions and is the largest importer of Iranian oil. China and Iran have built a trading system that uses mostly Chinese yuan and a network of middlemen, avoiding the dollar and exposure to U.S. regulators.

""Any refinery, company, or broker that chooses to purchase Iranian oil or facilitate Iran's oil trade places itself at serious risk,"" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in the statement.

""The United States is committed to disrupting all actors providing support to Iran's oil supply chain, which the regime uses to support its terrorist proxies and partners.""

GUIDANCE FOR SHIPPING

The Treasury on Wednesday also updated guidance for shipping and maritime stakeholders on ""detecting and mitigating Iranian oil sanctions evasion,"" warning, among other things, that Iran depends on a vast shadow fleet to disguise oil shipments.

The Treasury said it was the sixth round of sanctions targeting Iranian oil sales since Trump restored his ""maximum pressure"" campaign on Iran, which includes efforts to drive its oil exports down to zero to help prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon.

In his first 2017-2021 term, Trump withdrew the U.S. from a 2015 deal between Iran and world powers that placed strict limits on Tehran's uranium enrichment activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Trump also reimposed sweeping U.S. sanctions.

Since then, Iran has far surpassed that deal's limits on uranium enrichment.

Western powers accuse Iran of having a clandestine agenda to develop nuclear weapons capability by enriching uranium to a high level of fissile purity, above what they say is justifiable for a civilian atomic energy program. Tehran says its nuclear program is wholly for civilian power purposes.

""All sanctions will be fully enforced under the Trump Administration's maximum pressure campaign on Iran,"" State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a separate statement on Wednesday.

""As long as Iran attempts to generate oil revenues to fund its destabilizing activities, the United States will hold both Iran and all its partners in sanctions evasion accountable."" (Reuters)"

Her body was discovered in a stream in the Liaquatabad B-1 area on Sunday, a day after she went missing from her home in Sikandar Goth, which falls under the jurisdiction of Sachal Police Station.

According to the family, they were informed by Liaquatabad Police that the child's body had been found.

Speaking to the media, the girl's maternal uncle said that Sawera had gone missing around 11am and that when the body was recovered, it was unrecognisable.

He added that it was identified by her sister, who recognised her by her hair. The uncle also said the family had seen CCTV footage showing a woman attempting to take the girl away.

In response to the tragedy, the family, joined by local residents, staged a protest on Gulzar Hijri Road, placing the child's body on the road and demanding the arrest of those responsible.

The protest disrupted traffic in the area for several hours before it was called off following assurances from the police that action would be taken. The girl's uncle also revealed that a missing person report had been filed at the Sachal Police Station soon after Sawera disappeared.

He claimed that her hands and feet were tied when the body was recovered, adding to the family's suspicions of foul play.

Police, however, said that no relevant CCTV footage from the area had been recovered so far.

A post-mortem examination has been conducted, and according to initial reports, there is no evidence of sexual assault. The investigation is ongoing.

The funeral prayer for Sawera was held at a mosque in Post Office Society. (The News)"

The register consists of documentary collections including books, manuscripts, maps, photographs, sound or video recordings, which bear witness to the shared heritage of humanity.

Collections are added to the register by decision of UNESCO's Executive Board, following the evaluation of nominations by an independent international advisory committee.

According to UNESCO, the following documents have been added to its Memory of the World Register.

Submitters: China and Sri Lanka.

The Trilingual Inscription is a stone tablet with Chinese, Persian and Tamil inscriptions, praising Buddha, God Vishnu and Allah. Discovered in 1911 in Sri Lanka by a British engineer, it is now preserved in the Colombo National Museum, with a replica exhibited in the Galle National Museum. Dated 15th February 1409, the tablet was installed by the Chinese Admiral Zheng He. Originally inscribed in the Treasure Boat Shipyard Park in Nanjingin, it was brought to Sri Lanka during his third voyage. The text mentions offerings made to a sacred mountain shrine. This is the only trilingual inscription having texts in Chinese, Tamil and Persian, which represent three different regions and cultures.

Submitter: Sri Lanka.

The four documents, kept at the Rankot Viharaya Buddhist temple in Panadura, hold immense historical, cultural, spiritual, and intellectual value. Created against the backdrop of religious discord between Buddhists and Christians in the mid-19th century, they consist of correspondence between the Christian and Buddhist leaders advocating for an open dialogue on doctrinal issues, as well as a transcription of the entire dialogue. This transcription spans 27 and a half pages of handwritten text on paper using ink. The event fostered reconciliation and mutual respect between the two religious communities. The English translations, later made available in Europe and the US, had a significant impact on religious activists and scholars in those countries, contributing to the recognition of Buddhism as an advanced religion.

In his letter, Abeyagoonasekera drew attention to his abrupt and unexplained transfer from the Ministry of Defence following the 2019 presidential election, while he was leading crucial post-attack research analysis as the Director General of the Institute of National Security Studies.

""The manner in which this transfer was orchestrated and not carried out raises serious questions of political interference and institutional compromise. Soon after the 2019 elections, I was informed of a transfer to Berlin as Minister Counsellor, an appointment that was never executed,"" he said.

He went on to note, ""In a conversation with former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on 2 June 2024--during an interview at his residence--he disclaimed personal involvement in my transfer, attributing the decision to senior advisors. Enclosed for your attention is a letter from Gen. Kamal Gunaratne (Attachment 2). At the time, several advisors closely affiliated with the Pathfinder Foundation appeared to influence this decision. During the time of my transfer, I was instructed several times by Prof. Rohan Gunaratna to apologize to Mr. Milinda Moragoda, the founder of Pathfinder Foundation, for allegedly interfering with their research--a claim that was never explained. While Mr. Moragoda acknowledged my outreach, he offered no further comment. This sequence of events strongly suggests that internal/external strategic interests may have been at play in the termination of my work related to the Easter Sunday attacks.""

Abeyagoonasekera further raised concerns related to the Monthly Threat Forecast (MTF) he submitted in January 2019 as Director General of INSS, in which he explicitly identified a high-probability threat based on the Wanathavilluwa detonator cache.

""This document was submitted directly to the President with my signature and is cited in Volume I of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCOI) report (pages 257, 262, and 352). I provided testimony before the Commission over two full days and submitted a 13-page report. Despite this, my contribution was only minimally referenced. Notably, the Commission acknowledged that had I received the Indian intelligence warning of 4 April 2019, it would have aligned directly with my earlier forecast, potentially enabling the prevention of the attacks,"" he said.

The Former Director of the Institute of National Security Studies of Sri Lanka appealed to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to address these matters with the seriousness they warrant.

""The truth behind the Easter Sunday attacks must not remain buried in bureaucratic obfuscation and political expediency. If justice is upheld concerning my abrupt transfer, I stand ready to serve my country with integrity and commitment.

The raid comes on the heels of a BCB-initiated investigation into suspicious behaviour during several BPL matches. A three-member independent inquiry committee has been formed to assist the board's Anti-Corruption Unit. It includes former appellate division judge Mirza Hussain Haider, former national cricketer Shakil Kasem, and international lawyer Dr. Khaled H. Chowdhury.

This is the first time since 2013 that the BPL is facing a formal probe over corruption. The spotlight is currently on ten players--eight local and two foreign--and four teams: Dhaka, Sylhet, Chattogram, and Rajshahi. Sources say investigations are focusing on irregular patterns during matches, including suspect no-balls, unusual batting slumps, and questionable squad selections.

The BCB, in a statement, said it remains committed to preserving the integrity of the game. ""We are determined to maintain a clean and transparent cricketing environment. This investigation reflects that commitment,"" the board noted.

Newly appointed BCB President Faruque Ahmed also addressed the situation publicly, admitting that corruption and internal irregularities have taken root over the past decade. He said confronting these issues head-on will be key to rebuilding trust in the board and the game.

The investigation is still in its early stages. However, officials close to the probe say findings so far suggest deeper structural problems within franchise operations, including possible links to illegal betting networks.

As cricket remains Bangladesh's most passionately followed sport, the outcome of this investigation is being closely watched--not just by fans and media, but by players, sponsors, and international cricket bodies alike. (Athlon Sports)"

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/18/ransomware-attacks-on-sri-lankan-businesses-continue-to-surge/,2025-04-18,Ransomware attacks on Sri Lankan businesses continue to surge,"A total of 2,803 ransomware incidents were detected and blocked by Kaspersky cybersecurity solutions for businesses in Sri Lanka from January to December 2024. The 6% growth in attacks highlights the persistent threat of ransomware to organizations across industries, reinforcing the need for a robust cybersecurity strategy.

Experts from the global cybersecurity company urge businesses of all sizes to strengthen their IT security posture, as targeted ransomware attacks continue to evolve into sophisticated operations with severe financial and reputational consequences.

In November 2024, Sri Lanka faced cyberattacks on major corporations and government entities. These incidents underscored the importance of strengthening the nation's cybersecurity defenses, as attackers exploited vulnerabilities to steal sensitive information and potentially gain unauthorized access to critical systems.

""It's clear that ransomware operators are targeting all industries in Sri Lanka. While the total number of attempts may seem moderate, organizations must recognize the devastating impact of even a single successful ransomware infection--both financially and reputationally. Businesses should invest in cybersecurity technologies that offer proven, absolute anti-ransomware effectiveness, as not all security solutions provide the same level of protection,"" said Sam Yan, Head of Sales for Asia Emerging Countries at Kaspersky.

Kaspersky's cybersecurity solutions, including Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business, Kaspersky Small Office Security, and Kaspersky Standard, demonstrated 100% ransomware protection in 10 different real-life attack scenarios during regular Advanced Threat Protection assessments conducted by AV-TEST.

To combat ransomware and aid affected victims, Kaspersky continues its collaboration with Europol, the Dutch National Police, and other international cybersecurity stakeholders through the No More Ransom initiative, launched in 2016. This initiative provides free decryption tools, guidelines, and instructions for reporting cybercrimes worldwide.

As of the end of 2024, Kaspersky marked eight years as a key contributor to the No More Ransom initiative. Over this period, Kaspersky's free decryption tools have expanded to cover 42 ransomware families, assisting over 2.3 million victims globally, as reported by Europol. These efforts underscore Kaspersky's unwavering commitment to fighting ransomware and strengthening global cybersecurity resilience.

To protect yourself and your business from ransomware attacks, consider following the rules proposed by Kaspersky experts: Do not expose remote desktop/management services (such as RDP, MSSQL, etc.) to public networks unless absolutely necessary and always use strong passwords, two-factor authentication and firewall rules for them. Promptly install available patches for commercial VPN solutions providing access for remote employees and acting as gateways in your network. Always keep software updated on all the devices you use to prevent ransomware from exploiting vulnerabilities.

Focus your defense strategy on detecting lateral movements and data exfiltration to the Internet. Pay special attention to the outgoing traffic to detect cybercriminals' connections. Back up data regularly with special attention to offline backup strategies. Make sure you can quickly access it in an emergency when needed. Avoid downloading and installing pirated software or software from unknown sources. Assess and audit your supply chain and managed services' access to your environment. Prepare an action plan for reputational risk of your data exposure in the unfortunate event of data theft.

Use solutions like Kaspersky Next before attackers reach their final goals. To protect the corporate environment, educate your employees. Dedicated training courses can help, such as the ones provided in the Kaspersky Automated Security Awareness Platform. Use the latest Threat Intelligence information to stay aware of actual TTPs used by threat actors. The Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal is a single point of access for Kaspersky's TI, providing cyberattack data and insights gathered by our team for over 26 years."

As a trusted long-term insurer, Amana Life provides policyholders with the best investment choices, ensuring they can build and secure their financial future with confidence.

Gehan Rajapakse, CEO of Amana Takaful Life PLC

This achievement is driven by the company's diverse, risk-rated investment options, strategically allocated across fixed deposits, bank investments, equity markets, and gold funds. This structure allows policyholders to balance security and growth, selecting funds that align with their financial goals while adapting to market conditions. As the only life insurer in Sri Lanka offering such flexibility, Amana Life empowers customers to optimize their investments while maintaining long-term financial stability.

The review of Funds as of December 31, 2024, demonstrates exceptional returns across all investment avenues, reaffirming Amana Life's position as the insurer of choice for those seeking the best investment opportunities. The Protected Multiple Fund (PMF), with a Fixed Deposit base of 90% of its fund value, demonstrated steady returns, despite Sri Lanka experiencing interest rate cuts regularly over the past 24 months. PMF produced returns of 18.1% for the said period on an annualized basis while the market rates for Fixed Deposits reached single digits towards the latter part of 2024.

""At Amana Life, we are committed to providing our long-term policyholders with both protection and rewarding investment opportunities,"" said Gehan Rajapakse, CEO of Amana Takaful Life PLC. ""These results prove that we are not just offering life insurance, but also a well-structured pathway for long-term financial security and growth. However, it is important to note that past returns are not a guarantee of future performance, as market conditions can influence future results.""

The Growth Multiple Fund (GMF), operating with a balance of both Fixed Deposits and Equity, delivered 26.9% of returns for the past 12 months. The post-election surge in equity alongside long-term Fixed Deposits placements at higher rates secured benefits for the Fund to finish strong in 2024. GMF also produced 21.7% of annualized returns for the 24-month period, ended 31st December 2024. The post-election rise in equity also benefitted the Volatile Multiple Fund (VMF), which managed to post a 12-month return of 30.6%.

The continuous increase in gold prices across 2024 advanced The Bullion Multiple Fund (BMF), which showed a 12-month return of 12.4% and a 36-month return of 20.2% (annualized). The Gold Investment Fund (GIF) too showed a steady 12-month return of 6.0%, despite new reforms to tax regulations.

With a customer-first approach, Amana Life Insurance ensures that long-term policyholders not only protect their loved ones but also grow their wealth with the best long-term investment solutions available. This distinct advantage allows policyholders to tailor their financial plans based on their future aspirations, whether it is securing a child's education, retirement planning, or achieving long-term wealth accumulation.

Amana Takaful Life continues to redefine the life insurance landscape in Sri Lanka, providing long-term policyholders with unmatched investment options while ensuring comprehensive financial protection. In addition to exceptional investment options, Amana Life Insurance offers valuable benefits such as Personal Accident Cover, Critical Illness Cover, Hospitalization Cover, Spouse Life Cover, and Top-up Protection. With a strong track record of delivering superior returns and these added protections, Amana Takaful Life remains the ultimate choice for those looking to build a secure and prosperous future."

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/18/kaspersky-discovers-sophisticated-chrome-zero-day-exploit-used-in-active-attacks/,2025-04-18,Kaspersky discovers sophisticated Chrome zero-day exploit used in active attacks,"Kaspersky has identified and helped patch a sophisticated zero-day vulnerability in Google Chrome (CVE-2025-2783) that allowed attackers to bypass the browser's sandbox protection system. The exploit, discovered by Kaspersky's Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT), required no user interaction beyond clicking a malicious link and demonstrated exceptional technical complexity. Kaspersky researchers have been acknowledged by Google for discovering and reporting this vulnerability.

In mid-March 2025, Kaspersky detected a wave of infections triggered when users clicked personalized phishing links delivered via email. After clicking, no additional action was needed to compromise their systems. Once Kaspersky's analysis confirmed that the exploit leveraged a previously unknown vulnerability in the latest version of Google Chrome, Kaspersky swiftly alerted Google's security team. A security patch for the vulnerability was released on March 25, 2025.

Kaspersky researchers dubbed the campaign ""Operation ForumTroll"", as attackers sent personalized phishing emails inviting recipients to the ""Primakov Readings"" forum. These lures targeted media outlets, educational institutions, and government organizations in Russia. The malicious links were extremely short-lived to evade detection, and in most cases ultimately redirected to the legitimate website for ""Primakov Readings"" once the exploit was taken down.

The zero-day vulnerability in Chrome was only part of a chain that included at least two exploits: a still-unobtained remote code execution (RCE) exploit that apparently launched the attack, while the sandbox escape discovered by Kaspersky constituted the second stage. Analysis of the malware's functionality suggests the operation was designed primarily for espionage. All evidence points to an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group.

""This vulnerability stands out among the dozens of zero-days we've discovered over the years,"" said Boris Larin, principal security researcher at Kaspersky GReAT. ""The exploit bypassed Chrome's sandbox protection without performing any obviously malicious operations - it's as if the security boundary simply didn't exist. The technical sophistication displayed here indicates development by highly skilled actors with substantial resources. We strongly advise all users to update their Google Chrome and any Chromium-based browser to the latest version to protect against this vulnerability.""

Google has credited Kaspersky for uncovering and reporting the issue, reflecting the company's ongoing commitment to collaboration with the global cybersecurity community and ensuring user safety.

Kaspersky continues to investigate Operation ForumTroll. Further details, including a technical analysis of the exploits and malicious payload, will be released in a forthcoming report once Google Chrome user security is assured. Meanwhile, all Kaspersky products detect and protect against this exploit chain and associated malware, ensuring users are shielded from the threat.

Kaspersky Next EDR Expert, a core component of the comprehensive Kaspersky Next XDR (Extended Detection and Response) Expert platform, played a crucial role in detecting a wave of infections caused by previously unknown, highly sophisticated malware. Our exploit detection and protection technologies swiftly identified a zero-day exploit before it became publicly known, enabling us to thoroughly analyze its behavior and impact.

This discovery follows Kaspersky GReAT's previous identification of another Chrome zero-day (CVE-2024-4947), which was exploited last year by the Lazarus APT group in a cryptocurrency theft campaign. In that case, Kaspersky researchers found a type confusion bug in Google's V8 JavaScript engine that enabled attackers to bypass security features through a fake cryptogame website.

To safeguard against sophisticated attacks like these, Kaspersky security experts recommend implementing these key protective measures:


* Ensure timely software updates: Regularly patch your operating system and browsers--especially Google Chrome--so attackers cannot exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities.

* Adopt a multi-layered security approach: Along with endpoint protection, consider solutions like Kaspersky Next XDR Expert that leverage AI/ML to correlate data from multiple sources and automate detection and response against advanced threats and APT campaigns.

* Leverage threat intelligence services: Up-to-date, contextual information--such as Kaspersky Threat Intelligence--helps you stay informed about emerging zero-day exploits and the latest attacker techniques."

With seven participating countries in Africa, operation Red Card resulted in the arrest of 306 individuals suspected of links to cybercrimes such as mobile banking, investment and messaging app scams, and seizure of 1,842 devices.

Conducted from November 2024 to February 2025, operation Red Card was delivered through INTERPOL's African Joint Operation against Cybercrime (AFJOC) and brought together law enforcers from Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Togo and Zambia.

The operation conduct was preceded by a threat intelligence data exchange, which was enriched by INTERPOL and its private sector partners, including Kaspersky. Kaspersky has shared with the law enforcement agency the results of an analysis of samples of a malicious Android application that targeted users in African countries along with the data on related infrastructure.

Altogether, the cybercriminal cases uncovered by the Red Card participants have made prey more than 5,000 people. Among operation highlights were Nigeria: Nigerian police arrested 130 people, including 113 foreign nationalsfor their alleged involvement in cyber-enabled scams such as online casino and investment fraud. The suspects, who converted proceeds to digital assets to conceal their tracks, were recruited from different countries to run the illegal schemes in as many languages as possible. Zambia: officers apprehended 14 suspected members of a criminal syndicate that hacked into victims' phones. The scam involved sending a message containing a malicious link which, when clicked, installed malware on the device. This allowed hackers to take control of the messaging account, and ultimately the phone, giving them access to banking apps. The hackers were also able to use the victim's messaging apps to share the malicious link within conversations and groups, enabling the scam to spread.

Rwanda: Rwandan authorities arrested 45 members of a criminal network for their involvement in social engineering scams that defrauded victims of over USD 305,000 in 2024 alone. Their tactics included posing as telecommunications employees and claiming fake 'jackpot' wins to extract sensitive information and gain access to victims' mobile banking accounts. Another method involved impersonating an injured family member to ask relatives for financial assistance towards hospital bills. And South Africa: local authorities arrested 40 individuals and seized more than 1,000 SIM cards, along with 53 desktops and towers linked to a sophisticated SIM box fraud scheme. This setup, which reroutes international calls as local ones, is commonly used by criminals to carry out large-scale SMS phishing attacks.

Neal Jetton, INTERPOL's Director of the Cybercrime Directorate, said ""The success of Operation Red Card demonstrates the power of international cooperation in combating cybercrime, which knows no borders and can have devastating effects on individuals and communities. The recovery of significant assets and devices, as well as the arrest of key suspects, sends a strong message to cybercriminals that their activities will not go unpunished.""

""Kaspersky is proud to be part of this collaborative effort led by INTERPOL. The evolving threat landscape in Africa requires a multi-stakeholder dialogue and joint efforts of public and private organizations to address the cybersecurity challenges the region faces today. The Red Card operation is a notable example of such cooperation, showcasing how the expertise of private companies coupled with extensive investigative capacities of law enforcers can foster a more cyber-resilient environment,"" comments Yuliya Shlychkova, Vice President, Global Public Affairs, Kaspersky.

Kaspersky and INTERPOL have a vast record of joint operations aimed at combating cybercrime in the African region, with Kaspersky having supported two editions of INTERPOL's Africa Cyber Surge operations. Just recently, Kaspersky was also a contributor to INTERPOL's joint action with AFRIPOL, which last year became the company's official partner in fostering a more cybersafe climate across Africa. This partnership focuses on sharing Kaspersky's extensive data on local cyberthreats and cybercrime trends in the region."

The US president refused on Friday to cast blame on either Russian President Vladimir Putin, who ordered the February 2022 full-scale invasion of pro-Western Ukraine, or Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But he insisted both sides had to make progress.

""Now, if, for some reason, one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we're just going to say: 'You're foolish. You're fools. You're horrible people' - and we're going to just take a pass,"" Trump said.

""But, hopefully, we won't have to do that.""

Rubio further suggested on Friday that Trump's patience towards the negotiations is running thin.

""If it's not possible, if we're so far apart that this is not going to happen, then I think the president is probably at a point where he's going to say, 'Well, we're done,'"" he said.

Trump told reporters on Friday, however, that he did not want to say he was walking away from the talks. He said he still believes there is a good chance to end the conflict.

""It's coming to a head right now,"" he said.

US Vice President JD Vance also said he was ""optimistic"" a resolution could be reached, while speaking on a trip to Rome. (Al Jazeera)"

This moment holds deep meaning, as it symbolizes Christ's power to dispel the darkness within human hearts, bringing new hope and transforming lives.

However, on Easter Sunday, April 21, 2019, a series of inhumane suicide attacks targeted several Catholic churches and hotels in our country. These horrific acts continue to cause immense sorrow and anguish among Catholic devotees to this day. In the aftermath, certain political parties exploited the tragedy for their own gain, while the current government has failed to bring the true masterminds behind the attacks to justice. Even after six years, those who lost their lives, their loved ones, or suffered lasting injuries are still waiting for justice.

During election campaigns, many politicians loudly pledged to ensure justice for the victims, but it is clear that none of those who came into power afterward had a genuine will to deliver on those promises. Therefore, instead of spreading rumors and baseless claims, we must all work toward ensuring justice for every individual affected by these attacks.

In conclusion, urge everyone to rise above narrow political interests and reactive tendencies. Let us come together as a nation and move forward with unity and purpose.

As we mark this day of joy and reflection, we also solemnly remember the horrific events of Easter Sunday, April 21, 2019. Today, the pain remains six years later, and so does our responsibility. We stand in solidarity with the families of the victims, with the Christian community, and with all citizens who continue to seek truth and justice.

As a government, we reaffirm our commitment to ensuring that justice is served. Ongoing efforts to investigate the attacks and uncover all truths without obstruction or delay remain a top priority. Accountability, transparency, and genuine justice are essential to honouring the memory of the victims and restoring public trust.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/20/apples-urgent-warning-update-now-to-protect-your-iphone/,2025-04-20,Apple's warning: Update now to protect your iPhone,"Apple has released a critical security update, iOS 18.4.1, urging all iPhone users to install it immediately due to two serious security vulnerabilities that are being actively exploited in cyberattacks. These vulnerabilities affect the iPhone's CoreAudio and Pointer Authentication systems, allowing malicious actors to execute arbitrary code and access sensitive data.

The attack on the CoreAudio is detailed by Apple as being ""an extremely sophisticated attack against against specific targeted individuals on iOS' and could see 'code execution' occur if an audio stream is processed in a 'maliciously crafted media file'.

Apple said, ""We are aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on ios. This update provides important bug fixes and security updates, and addresses a rare issue that prevents wireless CarPlay connection in certain vehicles.""

Apple's security update fixes two critical vulnerabilities that allowed hackers to access and exploit iPhone audio streams. These flaws were reportedly used to target specific individuals, including government officials and journalists. To address the issue, Apple patched a memory corruption problem, preventing potential widespread exploitation and protecting user security.

The second vulnerability involved Return Pointer Authentication Code (RPAC), a security feature designed to prevent attackers from manipulating code. Hackers exploited this flaw to bypass security measures, gaining read-and-write capabilities on affected devices, including iPads, Apple TVS, and MacBooks. The latest update has patched these vulnerabilities, fixing the issue and enhancing device security.

Key Updates:

- iOS 18.4.1: Fixes critical security flaws in CoreAudio and RPAC, protecting against sophisticated exploits and potential spyware attacks.

- iPadOS 18.4.1: Also addresses security vulnerabilities to ensure device protection.

- macOS Sequoia 15.4.1: Includes essential security updates to safeguard Mac devices.

- tvOS 18.4.1 and visionOS 2.4.1: Provide security patches for Apple TV and Vision Pro devices.

To update to iOS 18.4.1 or iPadOS 18.4.1:

1. Go to Settings

2. Tap General

3. Select Software Update

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to download and install the update.

Make sure your device is connected to a stable internet connection and has sufficient battery life or is plugged into a power source. (NDTV)"
