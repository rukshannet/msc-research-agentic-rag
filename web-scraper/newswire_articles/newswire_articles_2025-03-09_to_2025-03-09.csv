https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/09/indias-tech-sector-projected-to-hit-350-billion-by-2030/,2025-03-09,India's tech sector projected to hit $350 billion by 2030,"On February 24, India's Defence Minister Rajnath Singh delivered a significant address at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Mandi, highlighting the rapid growth and potential of the country's technology sector.

Singh projected that India's tech industry is on course to reach a valuation of $350 billion by 2030, driven by innovation, digital transformation, and government initiatives fostering technological advancements.

India's rising technological landscape

India has emerged as a global powerhouse in technology, fueled by a strong ecosystem of startups, increased foreign investments, and supportive government policies.

The country's digital economy has witnessed exponential growth over the past decade, bolstered by key developments in artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductor manufacturing, cybersecurity, and 5G telecommunications.

Singh emphasised that India's technology sector plays a crucial role not just in economic expansion but also in national security.

He noted that cutting-edge technological advancements are imperative for strengthening India's defence capabilities and ensuring the nation remains competitive on the global stage.

One of the primary factors contributing to India's tech boom is the government's proactive approach toward digitalisation and innovation.

Various flagship programmes, such as 'Digital India,' 'Make in India,' and 'Startup India,' have provided crucial support for tech-driven enterprises.

The government has also increased funding for research and development (R&D) initiatives, fostering a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship.

Additionally, India's push towards self-reliance (Atmanirbhar Bharat) has encouraged the domestic manufacturing of high-tech products, including semiconductors, drones, and defence equipment.

Rajnath Singh emphasised the importance of public-private partnerships in this domain, citing collaborations between IITs and industry leaders as instrumental in driving forward technological advancements.

Role of AI

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning have become fundamental to India's growth strategy.

The country has seen a surge in AI-driven applications across various industries, from healthcare and agriculture to fintech and defence. With the increased adoption of automation and data analytics, businesses are enhancing efficiency and productivity, further propelling the tech sector's valuation.

Quantum computing, blockchain, and cybersecurity are also gaining traction in India. Singh highlighted that investments in these fields will be essential in ensuring data security and positioning India as a leader in future-ready technologies.

Startup ecosystem and foreign investments

India's startup ecosystem has been a driving force behind the nation's tech sector expansion.

With over 100 unicorns and a strong pipeline of innovative companies, the country is attracting significant venture capital and foreign direct investment (FDI).

Global tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, and Apple have expanded their operations in India, underscoring the nation's growing prominence in the tech industry.

Singh pointed out that India's young and dynamic workforce is a key advantage, with millions of skilled engineers, programmers, and researchers contributing to groundbreaking innovations.

The government has also facilitated ease of doing business by streamlining regulations and providing tax incentives for tech startups.

Cybersecurity and defence tech advancements

Given his role as the Defence Minister, Singh emphasised the importance of cybersecurity in India's tech expansion.

As cyber threats become more sophisticated, investing in robust cybersecurity infrastructure is imperative for national security and economic stability.

He highlighted recent developments in indigenous defence technologies, such as advanced surveillance systems, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and secure communication networks.

The minister also underscored India's increasing focus on space technology, with ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) spearheading ambitious satellite and exploration missions.

Space-tech startups are receiving greater government support, reinforcing India's position in the global space race.

Despite the optimistic outlook, Singh acknowledged that challenges remain in achieving the $350 billion valuation target. Infrastructure constraints, digital literacy gaps, and regulatory hurdles need to be addressed to sustain long-term growth. He called for greater industry-academia collaboration to bridge skill gaps and ensure a workforce ready for emerging technological demands.

Moreover, while India is making strides in semiconductor manufacturing, reducing dependence on global supply chains remains a priority.

Strengthening indigenous production capabilities will be critical in ensuring resilience in the face of global uncertainties.

India's technology sector is at a pivotal juncture, with immense growth potential backed by government initiatives, private sector investments, and a thriving start-up ecosystem.

Indian defence minister Rajnath Singh's projection of a $350 billion valuation by 2030 underscores the transformative impact of digitalisation and innovation.

As India continues to lead in emerging technologies and defence advancements, the country is poised to become a dominant player in the global tech landscape. (News Bomb)"

MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal condemned the ""provocative activities,"" as he denounced the actions of a ""small group of separatists and extremists"" in the official statement.

""We have seen the footage of a breach of security during the visit of EAM to the UK. We condemn the provocative activities of this small group of separatists and extremists.

Earlier in January, a group of pro-Khalistan activists gathered outside the Indian High Commission in London to stage a protest. They also stormed a cinema in Harrow, attempting to disrupt the screening of the Kangana Ranaut starrer film Emergency.

Condemning the incident, Jaiswal had said, ""We have consistently raised our concerns with the UK government regarding violent protests and intimidation by anti-India elements.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/09/china-to-adopt-policies-for-ageing-population-try-to-boost-birth-rates/,2025-03-09,"China to adopt policies for ageing population, try to boost birth rates","China will ""actively"" respond to population ageing with policies for its rapidly growing elderly and its young people, including providing childcare subsidies and making preschool education free, as it tries to boost the country's declining population.

The measures were announced in two official government documents on March 5, prepared for the annual meeting of the National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp Parliament.

China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024, as marriages plummeted by one-fifth, the biggest drop on record, despite efforts by authorities to encourage young couples to wed and have children.

Rapid ageing has become a growing concern in the world's second-largest economy, with the number of those aged 60 and older expected to rise at least 40 per cent to more than 400 million by 2035, equal to the populations of Britain and the United States combined.

China said it would raise minimum basic old age benefits for rural and non-working urban residents and make an ""appropriate increase"" in the basic pension benefits for retirees, without giving other details.

It will also expand public interest elderly care services, particularly in rural areas and for seniors with physical disabilities.

Authorities will ""prudently advance the reform to gradually raise"" the statutory retirement age, said Premier Li Qiang's official work report, without giving further details.

China raised its retirement age for men to 63 years from 60, while for women in white-collar work, it was raised to 58 years from 55. For women in blue-collar work, it was increased to 55 from 50. The changes came into effect on Jan 1 and are to be implemented over a 15-year period.

Childcare

China will provide childcare subsidies, the government reports said without giving further details, and formulate ""sound plans"" for a childcare service system, including progressively making preschool education free.

Care and services for children in rural areas and those who live with migrant worker parents would also be strengthened, the authorities said.

Women in early stages of pregnancy would also be offered more services, the documents stated, without giving further details.

Much of China's demographic downturn is the result of its one-child policy imposed between 1980 and 2015. Couples have been allowed to have up to three children since 2021.

However, a rising number of young Chinese are opting to not have children, put off by the high cost of childcare or an unwillingness to marry or put their careers on hold, while gender discrimination persists.

The authorities have tried to roll out incentives and measures to encourage couples to have babies, including expanding maternity leave, financial and tax benefits for having children as well as housing subsidies.

But China is one of the world's most expensive places to bring up a child, relative to its gross domestic product per capita, a prominent Chinese think-tank said in 2024, detailing the time and opportunity cost for women who give birth. (Reuters)"
https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/09/new-trump-travel-ban-could-bar-pakistanis-afghans-soon-sources/,2025-03-09,"New Trump travel ban could bar Pakistanis, Afghans soon: sources","A new travel ban under President Donald Trump could take effect as early as next week, potentially restricting entry into the US for individuals from Pakistan and Afghanistan, sources said.

The decision is based on a government assessment of security and vetting concerns, according to three sources familiar with the matter.

The well-informed sources, who requested anonymity, said other countries could also be on the list but did not know which ones.

The move harkens back to the Republican president's first-term ban on travellers from seven majority-Muslim nations, a policy that went through several iterations before it was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.

Former president Joe Biden, a Democrat who succeeded Trump, repealed the ban in 2021, calling it ""a stain on our national conscience"".

The new ban could affect tens of thousands of Afghans who have been cleared for resettlement in the US as refugees or on Special Immigrant Visas because they are at risk of Taliban retribution for working for the US during a 20-year war in their home country.

Trump issued an executive order on January 20 requiring intensified security vetting of any foreigners seeking admission to the US to detect national security threats.

That order directed several cabinet members to submit by March 12 a list of countries from which travel should be partly or fully suspended because their ""vetting and screening information is so deficient"".

Afghanistan will be included in the recommended list of countries for a complete travel ban, said the three sources and one other who also asked not to be identified.

The three sources said Pakistan also would be recommended for inclusion.

The departments of State, Justice and Homeland Security and the Office of the Director for National Intelligence, whose leaders are overseeing the initiative, did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

One source pointed out that Afghans cleared for resettlement in the US as refugees or on special visas first undergo intense screening that makes them ""more highly vetted than any population"" in the world.

The State Department office that oversees their resettlement is seeking an exemption for Special Immigrant Visa holders from the travel ban ""but it's not assumed likely to be granted,"" the source said.

That office, the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts, has been told to develop a plan by April for its closure, Reuters reported last month.

The Taliban, who seized Kabul as the last US troops pulled out in August 2021 after two decades of war, are confronting an insurgency by Daesh's regional branch. Pakistan also is grappling with violent militants.

Trump's directive is part of an immigration crackdown that he launched at the start of his second term.

He previewed his plan in an October 2023 speech, pledging to restrict people from several Middle Eastern and African countries and ""anywhere else that threatens our security.""

Shawn VanDiver, the head of #AfghanEvac, a coalition of groups that coordinates evacuation and resettlement of Afghans with the US government, urged those holding valid US visas to travel as soon as possible if they can.

""While no official announcement has been made, multiple sources within the US government suggest a new travel restriction could be implemented within the next week,"" he said in a statement.

This ""may significantly impact Afghan visa holders who have been awaiting relocation"" to the US, he said.

There are some 200,000 Afghans who have been approved for US resettlement or have pending US refugee and Special Immigrant Visa applications.

They have been stranded in Afghanistan and nearly 90 other countries -- including about 20,000 in Pakistan -- since January 20, when Trump ordered a 90-day freeze on refugee admissions and foreign aid that funds their flights. (The International)"
https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/09/uproar-over-alleged-free-land-allotment-to-muralitharans-company-in-india/,2025-03-09,Uproar over alleged free land allotment to Muralitharan's Company in India,"Questions have been raised in the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly regarding the allotment of land to former Sri Lankan cricketer Muttiah Muralitharan's company, Ceylon Beverages.

The Jammu and Kashmir government found itself in a contentious situation on Saturday following allegations of a 25-acre free land allotment to Sri Lankan cricketer Muttiah Muralitharan's company, Ceylon Beverages.

The company plans to establish an aluminium can manufacturing and beverages filling unit in the Bhagthali industrial estate in Kathua district adjoining Punjab, with an investment of ₹1,642 crore.

The issue came to light after CPM MLA Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami raised a question in the Legislative Assembly, seeking clarity on the land deal. However, Agriculture Minister Javaid Ahmad Dar feigned ignorance when questioned, admitting that he had no knowledge of the land allotment to Muralitharan's company.

The controversy centers on the fact that the 25 acres of land were reportedly allocated to Ceylon Beverages free of charge as part of Jammu and Kashmir industrial policy, introduced after the abrogation of Article 370. The land allotment has sparked concerns among locals, especially those claiming that they had proprietary rights over the land and were allegedly evicted to make way for the project.

Muralitharan's company already operates a plant in Karnataka and now seeks to expand into Jammu and Kashmir. The lease for the land was reportedly signed on June 14 last year. According to the company's online profile, Ceylon Beverages is Sri Lanka's largest beverage processing, filling, and exporting entity, providing contract filling services to major international clients like Coca-Cola and Nestle.

J&K industrial policy, which was launched on April 1, 2021, offers incentives like subsidies on capital investment, GST rebates on plant and machinery purchases, and financial assistance for working capital loans. This policy aims to attract large-scale investments and create jobs within the region.

Since its inception, the UT administration has received interest from a range of companies, including Dubai-based Emaar Group and India's Kandhari Beverages Pvt Ltd, with proposed investments worth over ₹1.23 lakh crore.

Kathua district, due to its proximity to Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, has become a focal point for many industrial projects.

Tarigami brought up the issue during a discussion on satellite townships being developed across the Union Territory. ""What are these townships about? Who will be residing there? A Sri Lankan cricketer has been allotted land without being charged a paisa,"" he remarked.

Congress MLA Ghulam Ahmed Mir echoed Tarigami's concerns, calling the situation a ""serious issue"" that warranted a thorough discussion in the Assembly.

Responding to the concerns of the legislators, Agriculture Minister Javaid Ahmad Dar acknowledged the matter but said it falls under the Revenue Department's jurisdiction. ""We will look into the matter to verify the facts,"" he said.

This is not the first time since the abrogation of Article 370 that questions have been raised regarding land allotments in Jammu and Kashmir. However, the involvement of a high-profile foreign figure like Muralitharan has added a new layer of complexity to the ongoing debate.

In defence of the land deal, a senior government official emphasized that Muralitharan's investment aligned with the administration's larger strategy to turn Jammu and Kashmir into an industrial hub. The official stressed that such foreign investments are crucial for the region's economic growth and the creation of much-needed jobs. (Deccan Herald)"

The task force's stated mission is to ""showcase the Nation's pride and hospitality while promoting economic growth and tourism,"" according to the order. Trump will chair the body.

The U.S. is preparing to co-host the world's most-watched sports tournament alongside Canada and Mexico amid rising geopolitical tensions, as Trump escalates a trade war with the longtime allies.

Asked about co-hosting the tournament with the neighbors after slapping them with tariffs, Trump said it only adds to the drama on the pitch.

""I think it's going to make it more exciting,"" said Trump.

""Tension is a good thing,"" the president also said. ""It makes it much more exciting.""

Infantino, the controversial president of soccer's governing body, offered estimates of the economic impact the tournament will have in the U.S.

FIFA's president estimated that between the 2026 World Cup and the lesser-known 2025 Club World Cup, which will also be hosted in the U.S., the country will rake in an estimated $40 billion.

Infantino also surmised that the tournaments will add 200,000 jobs to the country and bring in 10 million tourists.

Trump asked Infantino if the U.S., a perennial underdog in men's soccer, could win the tournament for the first time in the nation's history.

""Yes, with the public behind [them],"" responded FIFA's president.

""He knows what to say,"" quipped Trump.

Infantino listed South American powerhouses Argentina and Brazil and European giants England, Germany, and Spain as the favorites for the tournament. Trump said he plans to attend ""more than one"" of the World Cup's 104 matches.

Also in the Oval Office was Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who is taking charge of security for the event. Questions about the United States' ability to host the tournament have swirled ever since mayhem erupted at the Copa América final in Florida last summer.

In July 2024, fans without tickets stormed the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, trampling security officers, breaking down barricades, and vandalizing the stadium in order to watch Argentina take on Colombia for the trophy.

Noem said she'll be running ""incident command centers"" in the American host cities and partnering with federal agencies, local law enforcement and international partners to ensure the tournament goes smoothly.

Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Seattle, and San Francisco are the American host cities for the upcoming tournament. New York and San Francisco's games will be held at stadiums in East Rutherford, N.J., and Santa Clara, Calif., respectively.

Canada's games will be hosted in Toronto and Vancouver, while Mexico's matches will be held in Guadalajara, Mexico City, and Monterrey.

The tension between the co-hosts was underscored last week when the American-born coach of the Canadian national team blasted Trump's repeated comments about Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state.

""If I have one message to our president, it's lay off the ridiculous rhetoric about Canada being the 51st state,"" Canada coach Jesse Marsch said in late February.

""As an American, I'm ashamed of the arrogance and disregard that we've shown one of our historically oldest, strongest, and most loyal allies,"" said Marsch, a native of Racine, Wisconsin, who made two appearances for the U.S. men's national team during his playing career.

Infantino also took the opportunity in the Oval Office to unveil the new trophy for FIFA's Club World Cup. The tournament, which features the best club teams from each continent, has historically been an afterthought in the soccer world. But FIFA recently raised the stakes by announcing $1 billion in prize money for the tournament. (NBC)"

During police interrogation, Ranya made several crucial revelations, including details about an international syndicate of women involved in gold smuggling.

Ranya confessed that she was a part of this smuggling network, which operates across borders and involves multiple women. This group is believed to be operating on an international scale, with some public servants also allegedly linked to the syndicate. The police are now on the lookout for other members involved in this illicit activity.

CBI joins investigation

The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) had previously acted on a tip-off, leading to Ranya's arrest as she was returning from Dubai. During a subsequent search at her residence, law enforcement officials seized millions of rupees worth of jewelry. Following Ranya's statements, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has now taken charge of the case. They are closely investigating the syndicate's operations and are working to uncover other members involved in the international gold smuggling network.

Background of Ranya Rao

Ranya Rao, a former Kannada film actress, has starred in several movies. Recently, her name has been making headlines for all the wrong reasons. Interestingly, Ranya's father is an IPS officer, though not her biological father, but a step-parent. This connection has only added to the complexity of the case, as Ranya now faces severe legal scrutiny.

Currently under police custody, Ranya is being interrogated to uncover further details about the smuggling ring. The CBI is intensifying its efforts to expose the full extent of this international women-led gold smuggling syndicate. Updates on the investigation are expected soon, as authorities continue to make headway in this high-profile case. (India TV)"
