Mahanama stated that he had previously shared similar views when invited to discuss such matters with former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa in May 2020.

He emphasized that rather than investing in new cricket stadiums, available funds should be allocated to upgrading existing facilities to better support young cricketers across the country.

The preliminary work for the Matara Polhena International Cricket Training School and Stadium is expected to be completed within a month, Minister Sunil Handuneththi announced recently. A meeting was held last week at the Matara District Secretariat under the leadership of Minister Sunil Handuneththi, with the participation of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) officials and other relevant stakeholders to expedite the project.

""I strongly believe that the need of the hour and utilization of valuable funds should not be channelled to build new, expensive cricket stadiums in our nation. We have many grounds used from Division one to school level spread all over the country, especially from Moratuwa to Hambantota in the down south region and these funds would be much better utilized in a cohesive national plan to elevate selected facilities to the next level and develop other existing facilities to a level where children can train and grow their skills closer to home/school. This will definitely benefit a larger talent pool and create a more sustainable impact over the years. Unfortunately, the motives and purpose behind these new mega developments need to be scrutinized and questioned as they may have vested interests and not focused purely on the development of budding talent or following a validated ROI or cost-benefit analysis. I believe this is a matter worthy of the attention of the current President and Prime Minister, to ensure the right objective are at the forefront and the principles of clean Sri Lanka are followed"" Roshan Mahanama said.

Making a special statement, Wickremesinghe said that the commission was established with the sole purpose of discrediting him but failed to achieve its objective.

The report only mentioned his involvement in facilitating housing for police officers during the 1988-1990 insurgency but did not implicate him in any other allegations, he said.

""I was only summoned as a witness. According to the commission's findings, I was implicated only in the matter of providing housing for police officers, which, as per regulations, should have been done through the Inspector General of Police. The report indicates that both Nalin Delgoda and I were indirectly responsibile for this process. Apart from this, I was not implicated in any other allegations in the commission's report,"" Wickremesinghe said.

The former president further noted that the report was made available in Parliament in 2000, yet no party, including the JVP, requested a debate on it.

The full statement by former President Ranil Wickremesinghe:

In 1987, following the signing of the Indo-Lanka Accord, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) launched a wave of terror across the country.

During this period, President J.R. Jayewardene assigned the responsibility of securing key locations in the country to Cabinet ministers. Several economically significant sites were located in the Biyagama area, including the oil refinery, diesel power plant, the substation supplying electricity from Mahaweli to Colombo, and the free trade zone. The military was deployed to safeguard these locations.

To accommodate security personnel, it was decided to provide them with abandoned buildings and houses owned by the Lanka Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation. At the time, several employees of the Ceylon Electricity Board were residing in some of these houses.

During this period of terror, the Sapugaskanda police station was attacked, and its officer-in-charge was killed. In response, Deputy Minister of Defence Ranjan Wijeratne contacted me, requesting that the vacant houses in the complex be allocated to military and police personnel for their security. Consequently, the administrator at the time took steps to hand over the houses to Kelani Police Chief Nalin Delgoda.

Several individuals, including a provincial councilor, a cooperative society chairman, and a police sergeant, were assassinated during this period. Additionally, an attack was carried out on the residence of another provincial council member.

The government in power took steps to restore the country's stability, rebuilding the economy and ensuring national security.

After 1994, President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga appointed a commission to investigate allegations of a torture centre in the Batalanda area. Several individuals were summoned before the commission, and I was called as a witness. At that time, I was serving as the Leader of the Opposition. The establishment of the Batalanda Commission was politically motivated, but the attempt to use it for political gain was unsuccessful.

According to the commission's findings, I was implicated only in the matter of providing housing for police officers, which, as per regulations, should have been done through the Inspector General of Police. The report indicates that both Nalin Delgoda and I were indirectly responsibile for this process.

Apart from this, I was not implicated in any other allegations in the commission's report. The report also extensively documented the JVP's terrorist activities between 1988 and 1990, detailing the background and listing numerous violent acts committed by the JVP in Chapter Three. The entire history of those events is included in the report.

Beyond these findings, no other accusations in the report are relevant to me, and I completely reject the report.

No one can claim that the Batalanda Commission report was hidden. It was made available as a parliamentary session record in 2000, yet no one, including the JVP, requested a debate on it. Many did not accept the report, which may explain why no steps were taken to debate it in Parliament.

It is also noteworthy that no political party that came to power has attempted to use the report for political advantage. Furthermore, there is no precedent in Sri Lanka or other parliaments for debating a session record 25 years after its publication. (Newswire)"

Addressing the Parliament yesterday, Minister Herath said discussions will be held on how Sri Lanka could avoid the reciprocal tariffs.

Minister Herath pointed out that Sri Lanka will be unable to bear such tariffs on exports as the country's economic situation remains volatile.

The Foreign Minister further announced that a high-level Sri Lanka business forum will be held in the US next month with representatives of the Finance Ministry, Foreign Ministry, and delegates from the business community.

Minister Herath said Sri Lanka hopes to discuss the issue of tariffs and seek relief during discussions with U.S. Trade Office members during this visit.

He expressed hope that Sri Lanka, working within the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, would receive a tax waiver, as the country could not withstand increased tariffs.

In his first address of his second term to a joint session of Congress, US President Donald Trump defended his strict tariff policies, highlighting that the US has long faced high tariffs from several countries.

He announced that his administration would impose reciprocal tariffs on several countries, including Canada, Mexico, China, and India, starting April 2.

According to reports, last year, the US imported from Sri Lanka goods valued at US$3 billion, with more than 70% of the products from the garment sector going to the United States, making that country one of Sri Lanka's largest trading partners.

Following President Trump's announcement on reciprocal tariffs, the Sri Lankan Government is taking proactive measures to address its impact. (Newswire)"

Nitrous oxide is an odorless, colorless gas that leads to euphoria, relaxation, and dissociation from reality when inhaled.

The gas is used for various legitimate medical, industrial, and commercial purposes, such as being a propellant in whipped cream dispensers and water siphons.

It is available in compact, affordable cartridges that are easily accessible and sold under various brand names, including Galaxy Gas, Baking Bad, and Miami Magic.

The FDA cautioned against the improper use of these products in any canister, tank, or charger size, as misuse could result in severe health issues, including blood clots, loss of consciousness, paralysis, psychiatric disorders, and even death.

The regulator said that it is monitoring reports of adverse events following the inhalation of nitrous oxide products and will take appropriate actions, although it did not provide specific details.

In 2023, Britain banned the recreational use and possession of nitrous oxide, saying it fueled nuisance behavior and posed a health hazard. (Reuters)"

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/17/indias-transformative-journey-in-mobile-manufacturing/,2025-03-17,India's Transformative Journey in Mobile Manufacturing,"In the past decade, India has rapidly emerged as one of the world's largest and most dynamic hubs for mobile manufacturing. Once a consumer-dependent market, the Indian mobile industry has undergone a transformation, now playing a critical role in the global supply chains. This remarkable shift has been driven by government initiatives, foreign investments, and a growing domestic market, positioning India as a powerhouse in mobile manufacturing.

Domestic demand fuel mobile manufacturing growth

India's journey into mobile manufacturing started with the rapid rise in domestic demand for mobile phones. The early 2000s saw an internet revolution and a telecommunications boom, leading to an explosion in mobile phone usage. However, at that time, India relied heavily on imports, mainly from countries like China and South Korea, to meet its needs. This reliance on foreign imports spurred the Indian government to rethink its strategy and formulate policies aimed at transforming India into a self-sustaining manufacturing hub for electronics, including mobile phones.

The make in India initiative

The turning point for India's mobile manufacturing came with the launch of the ""Make in India"" initiative in 2014, spearheaded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The initiative aimed to promote domestic manufacturing, create jobs, and increase exports, with a strong focus on electronics.

The Make in India initiative provided critical incentives such as tax exemptions, subsidies, and efforts to streamline bureaucratic processes, making India an attractive proposition for both domestic and international companies. As a result, mobile manufacturing in India expanded exponentially. In 2014, there were only two mobile manufacturing units in the country; today, that number has grown to over 300, marking a significant expansion in this vital sector.

Mobile manufacturing moves from imports to independence

India's progress is evident in the dramatic shift from reliance on imports to local production. In 2014-15, just 26% of the mobile phones sold in India were made domestically, with the rest being imported. By 2024, that number had surged to an impressive 99.2%, with mobile phone manufacturing in India reaching a value of ₹4,22,000 crore (Approx USD 50 billion). Exports of mobile phones also grew exponentially, surpassing ₹1,29,000 crore (approx. USD 15 billion) in 2024.

Today, India manufactures around 325-330 million mobile phones annually, increased from 58 million in 2014-25 to 330 million in 2023-24, with over a billion mobile phones in use in the country. This shift in production capacity has positioned India as the world's second-largest mobile manufacturer. The country has become a key player not only in satisfying domestic demand but also in tapping into global markets, particularly in regions such as the Middle East, Africa, and Europe.

Mobile manufacturing enhance skill development and employment opportunities

The rise of mobile manufacturing in India has had a profound impact on job creation. The mobile manufacturing boom has also led to substantial employment opportunities in India. More than 20 million people are directly or indirectly employed in mobile manufacturing-related activities, including assembly, logistics, and the supply chain. This surge in employment has contributed to the socio-economic upliftment of many communities across the country, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas. These job opportunities have not only contributed to economic growth but also transformed the Indian workforce.

To meet the demands of an evolving industry, there has been a significant emphasis on skill development. Partnerships between the government, industry leaders, and educational institutions have led to the creation of specialized training programs. These initiatives have improved the skillset of the workforce, making India a more attractive destination for global manufacturers seeking to set up operations.

The semiconductor push enhances value chain

As India continues to expand its mobile manufacturing capacity, the focus is shifting toward deeper integration into the value chain. The country is now working on the development of semiconductor chips and finer components, areas that have historically been dominated by China and Taiwan. This push is in line with India's broader strategy of enhancing self-reliance and becoming a leader in the global electronics market.

The establishment of a domestic semiconductor manufacturing base has been a long-standing goal. In recent years, the Indian government has made strides toward this goal through the India Semiconductor Mission, which supports the creation of a local semiconductor industry.

The PLI push to mobile manufacturing

While the Make in India initiative laid the foundation, the government further accelerated India's rise as a mobile manufacturing hub by introducing the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme in 2020. The PLI scheme offers financial incentives to manufacturers based on the volume of production achieved, thus incentivizing companies to ramp up domestic manufacturing.

The PLI scheme has been a game-changer for the mobile manufacturing sector. It has attracted numerous global companies to either set up new manufacturing units or expand existing ones in India. This, in turn, has bolstered India's efforts to reduce dependence on imports, especially from China, its largest supplier of mobile phones.

India's mobile manufacturing success is not limited to the domestic market. The country has increasingly become an exporter of mobile phones and components, and this trend is expected to grow. The PLI scheme has played a critical role in boosting India's export potential by incentivizing manufacturers to ramp up production for international markets.

Strengthened supply chain reduce dependence on imports

The rapid growth of India's mobile manufacturing has also been supported by the development of a robust local supply chain. Initially, the country's mobile manufacturing industry was limited to phone assembly, with most components being imported. However, thanks to increased foreign direct investment (FDI) and government initiatives, many companies have set up local manufacturing plants for key components, including displays, batteries, and camera modules, significantly lowering production costs. This reduction in import dependency has made mobile phones more affordable for Indian consumers, further driving demand.

In conclusions, India's leap into mobile manufacturing is a remarkable success story that has transformed the country from a net importer of mobile phones to one of the world's largest mobile manufacturing hubs. With proactive government policies, substantial foreign investment, a growing supply chain, and a rising domestic demand, India is well-positioned to maintain its growth in this sector

As India continues to invest in infrastructure, skill development, and production capabilities, its mobile manufacturing industry is poised for even greater success. The country's journey from a consumer-driven market to a global manufacturing powerhouse is a testament to its resilience and strategic vision, and its role in the global mobile supply chain will only continue to expand in the years ahead.

As I stood among some of the most distinguished scholars of our time, I carried with me the centuries-old message of Indian Islam: love for all, malice towards none as reflected in the The noble honourifics salutation of our beloved Prophet Muhammed (Peace Be Upon Him) as ""Rahmatul al Alameen"" which is enlivened across Indian Subcontinent as the spiritual teachings of Shaikh Syed Khawaja Moinuddin Chishty al Hasani wal Hussaini(r) of Ajmer Sharif since last 800 years, as it continue to inspire not only Indian Muslims but also millions across the world who seek a path of peace and inclusivity.

Islam is thriving in India

Too often, global narratives fail to recognise the reality of Islam in India -- a land where the faith has flourished for over a thousand years, not just in numbers but in its vibrant cultural and spiritual expressions. With over 200 million Muslims, India is home to one of the world's largest Islamic populations. More importantly, it is a country where our faith is deeply intertwined with the nation's pluralistic fabric.

From the grand mosques of New Delhi to the humble Islamic Center's of Kashmir to Kerala, from the Quranic scholarship of Deoband to the mystical poetry of Hazrat Amir Khusrau, Indian Islam is as diverse as the land itself. It is a living testament to the spirit of coexistence. Despite differences in jurisprudence and practice, Indian Muslims have upheld the essence of Adab al-Ikhtilaf--the etiquette of respectful disagreement.

This is precisely what I emphasised in Makkah. If we, as an Ummah, wish to strengthen our bond, we must embrace diversity within Islam as a source of strength rather than division. Across the  world great Islamic traditions in the past have always flourished through dialogue, not discord.

The enduring relevance of Islamic spiritual traditions

Islamic spiritual traditions, which has shaped the Indian Muslim experience for centuries, remains one of the most powerful tools for fostering unity in an increasingly fragmented world. Since the 12th century, across in Indian subcontinent, it has always emphasised service to humanity, compassion, and the unbreakable bond of divine love.

In today's times, when extremism and sectarian conflicts threaten to divide us, the practical teachings and values of Islamic spiritual sciences hold even greater relevance. The noble teachers and practitioners of faith across Indian subcontinent in the past did not preach in ivory towers; they walked among the people, breaking bread with the poor, offering shelter to the weary, and spreading a message of inclusivity. Their lives were a testament to the Quranic verse:

""And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided."" (Surah Aal-E-Imran 3:103)

This is the same message I carried to Makkah, urging scholars and leaders to prioritize unity, social service, and intra-faith dialogue over sectarian divisions.

It is heartening to see that the importance of Islamic spiritual traditions is also recognized at the highest levels of Indian leadership. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken on multiple occasions about the role moderation and inclusivity has played in shaping India's Islamic traditions. Addressing the World Sufi Forum in 2016, he aptly remarked: ""Islamic Spiritual traditions as noble path of Sufism (Tassawaf) is the voice of peace, co-existence, and compassion. It is the antidote to forces of extremism. The world must embrace it.""

His government has supported efforts to preserve our Spiritual heritage, recognizing that it represents the best of India's Islamic traditions--traditions that do not just belong to Muslims but to the spiritual fabric of the entire nation.

A call for global Islamic unity

The conference in Makkah concluded with the adoption of the Encyclopedia of Islamic Intellectual Harmony, a landmark initiative aimed at fostering scholarly collaboration and mutual understanding. The Declaration on Building Bridges -- a foundational guide for joint Islamic action -- was also approved, reaffirming the need for intra-faith unity.

I extended my deepest gratitude to Sheikh Dr. Muhammad bin Abdul Karim Al-Issa, Secretary General of the Muslim World League, for his leadership in bringing this initiative to life. I also thanked Sheikh Abdul Rahman ibn Abdul Aziz al-Sudais, the Chief Imam of Masjid al-Haram in Makkah and the President of the Affairs of the Two Holy Mosques for his wise words on the importance of moderation, peace, and harmony.

At Ajmer Sharif in India, we have always believed that our mission goes beyond national borders. The Islamic spiritual message is not bound by geography; it is universal. It is this very spirit that India, with its long history of religious coexistence, continues to embody.

As I return from Makkah, I carry renewed hope that the bridges we built at this conference will lead to lasting change. The world is in dire need of spiritual guidance that unites rather than divides. And if there is one lesson Indian Islam has to offer, it is this: The path to God is paved with love, and in love, there is no place for division. (Khaleej Times)"

Lex Fridman is a research scientist who also hosts his podcast, ""Lex Fridman Podcast."" In his podcasts, several personalities from various walks of life have discussed issues ranging from complex niches to other areas of mass understanding.

Notable figures include political leaders like US President Donald Trump, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Argentinian Prime Minister Javier Milei, as well as leading personalities in their fields, such as Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, Magnus Carlson, and Yuval Noah Harari.

Mr Fridman wrote on X, ""I had an epic 3-hour podcast conversation with @narendramodi, Prime Minister of India. It was one of the most powerful conversations of my life. It'll be out tomorrow.""

Responding to Mr Fridman, Prime Minister Modi called it a ""fascinating conversation"" and shared that he discussed various time periods of his life, such as his childhood days, to the years spent in the Himalayas and eventually his way into public life.

""It was indeed a fascinating conversation with @lexfridman, covering diverse topics including reminiscing about my childhood, the years in the Himalayas and the journey in public life. Do tune in and be a part of this dialogue!"" PM Modi wrote on X.

Mr Fridman had announced on January 19 that he would conduct a podcast with PM Modi.

In a post on X, he said, ""I will be doing a podcast with Narendra Modi (@narendramodi), Prime Minister of India, at the end of February. I've never been to India, so I'm excited to finally visit and experience many facets of its vibrant, historic culture and its amazing people as fully as I can.""

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/17/pojk-struggles-with-soaring-prices-during-ramzan/,2025-03-17,PoJK struggles with soaring prices during Ramzan,"As the holy month of Ramzan unfolds, residents of Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) are struggling with soaring prices of essential goods, making it increasingly difficult for ordinary citizens to afford basic necessities, TNN Stories reported.

Despite government efforts to control prices before Ramzan, the administration's regulations have not been effectively implemented, leading to frustration among the public. In PoJK, particularly in Muzaffarabad, the capital of the region, prices of essential commodities such as fruits, vegetables, and meat have surged significantly.

Social worker M Altaaf Butt expressed concern, highlighting that while 2025 has arrived, little has changed in terms of alleviating the economic challenges faced by the people. ""The prices of mutton and other groceries have skyrocketed, and the situation is getting worse. Shopkeepers claim they have to purchase commodities at inflated prices from Rawalpindi and Mansehra,"" Butt said.

The rising cost of living is causing severe hardships, especially during Ramzan, a time when many rely on these items for their daily iftar and suhoor meals. Ordinary people are bearing the brunt of the price hike, facing significant challenges in affording basic goods, TNN Stories reported.

Authorities have been blamed for neglecting the issue, with accusations that they are indifferent to the hardships faced by the public. As the holy month progresses, there is growing demand for increased accountability from both market regulators and officials to ensure that essential items remain affordable and accessible to all.

In a similar incident, residents of Karachi are also grappling with a significant rise in the prices of essential goods, making it challenging for many to afford basic necessities. Local shopkeepers are being criticised for allegedly taking advantage of the situation, as the prices of dry fruits, spices, and crockery have skyrocketed, making them unaffordable for many, reported TNN Stories.

The sharp increase in prices has caused widespread frustration, with many wondering if the authorities will step in to support struggling communities during the holy month. (ANI)"
https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/17/son-of-jailed-chinese-journalist-demands-justice-as-ccp-tightens-grip-on-dissent/,2025-03-17,Son of jailed Chinese journalist demands justice as CCP tightens grip on dissent,"The son of imprisoned Chinese journalist Dong Yuyu has made a public appeal for his father's release, highlighting concerns over China's deteriorating press freedoms and political climate.

Dong Yifu, speaking at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on February 24, called on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to release his father, who was sentenced to seven years in prison on espionage charges.

Observers argue that Dong Yuyu's case underscores the CCP's intensified efforts to suppress dissent and tighten its control over public discourse amid political infighting.

Who Is Dong Yuyu?

Dong Yuyu, a respected journalist and longtime editor at the Communist Party-run Guangming Daily, was widely known for advocating moderate political reform and open dialogue with foreign scholars and journalists.

He was detained in 2022 while meeting with a Japanese diplomat in Beijing, an interaction that authorities used as the basis for his espionage charges.

His arrest shocked many in the journalism and diplomatic communities, as he had long been seen as a figure who sought constructive discourse rather than political opposition.

Espionage charges and CCP's crackdown

Espionage is a charge frequently used by the Chinese government to silence journalists, activists, and intellectuals.

Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has repeatedly condemned China's growing use of such accusations to justify imprisoning those who challenge the state's narrative.

Dong's sentencing comes amid a broader crackdown on press freedom, as President Xi Jinping's administration seeks to consolidate power and eliminate perceived threats to political stability.

His case is not unique--several other journalists and intellectuals have faced similar fates under vague and sweeping national security laws.

The CCP's tightening grip on information is particularly evident in its strict control over foreign interactions, which have increasingly been portrayed as acts of subversion.

Political infighting

Observers suggest that Dong Yuyu's imprisonment is part of a larger pattern reflecting growing political infighting within the CCP.

As Xi Jinping strengthens his authority, factions within the party have sought to eliminate individuals who advocate reform or maintain foreign ties.

The CCP's paranoia about external influence has intensified, leading to a climate where any engagement with foreign diplomats, journalists, or academics can be construed as espionage.

This crackdown extends beyond journalism, affecting business leaders, academics, and civil society figures.

The increasing use of espionage charges has also alarmed foreign diplomats and businesses operating in China, as it signals a willingness to criminalise routine interactions.

International response

The international community has condemned Dong Yuyu's sentencing and called for his immediate release.

Human rights organisations, including RSF and Amnesty International, have urged diplomatic pressure on Beijing to reconsider its stance on press freedom.

The U.S. State Department has also criticised China's treatment of journalists and reaffirmed its commitment to defending media freedoms worldwide.

Dong Yifu's public appeal in Washington has drawn significant attention, with press freedom advocates stressing the importance of continued international scrutiny.

His speech at the National Press Club highlighted the need for coordinated efforts to support detained journalists and push back against the CCP's growing authoritarianism.

Future of press freedom in China

China remains one of the most dangerous places in the world for journalists, ranking near the bottom of the World Press Freedom Index.

The CCP's control over information has only intensified in recent years, with sweeping censorship, mass surveillance, and legal crackdowns designed to stifle independent reporting.

Dong Yuyu's case exemplifies the risks faced by journalists who seek truth and transparency in China.

His sentencing sends a chilling message to others in the field, reinforcing the notion that any deviation from the official narrative can result in severe consequences.

As political tensions within China continue to escalate, the fate of journalists like Dong Yuyu will serve as a key indicator of the country's broader trajectory regarding human rights and press freedoms.

The imprisonment of Dong Yuyu on espionage charges is a stark reminder of the CCP's increasing intolerance toward independent journalism and foreign engagement.

As his son, Dong Yifu, continues to advocate for his release, the case serves as a rallying point for press freedom advocates worldwide.

With growing international pressure, the question remains whether the CCP will yield to demands for greater transparency or continue its path of authoritarian control.

The fight for Dong Yuyu's freedom is not just about one journalist--it is about the future of truth, transparency, and free expression in China. (Hong Kong Post)"
https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/17/pakistan-climbs-to-5th-position-in-illegal-immigration-to-europe-a-tragic-saga-of-desperation-and-loss/,2025-03-17,Pakistan climbs to 5th position in illegal immigration to Europe: a tragic saga of desperation and loss,"In a harrowing incident that once again brought global attention to the growing crisis of illegal migration, a vessel carrying 65 Europe-bound migrants capsized off the coast of Libya last month, resulting in the tragic deaths of 16 Pakistanis.

This heart-breaking event sheds light on the rising trend of illegal immigration from Pakistan to Europe, a phenomenon that has escalated in recent years despite international efforts to curb human trafficking and unsafe migration.  

Pakistan has now climbed to the fifth position among the countries accounting for the most illegal immigrants to Europe, with thousands of Pakistanis risking their lives every year in pursuit of a better future.

The recent tragedy has reignited calls for a more effective response to human smuggling networks, improved economic opportunities within Pakistan, and greater international cooperation to address this escalating crisis.  
 
On February 18, a wooden vessel carrying 65 migrants attempting to reach European shores capsized in the Mediterranean Sea, near the Libyan coast.

Among the passengers were 16 Pakistani nationals, who had embarked on the perilous journey in search of better economic prospects and a brighter future in Europe.

According to local reports from the Libyan Red Crescent, the vessel departed from the Libyan port city of Zuwara, a notorious departure point for illegal migrants seeking entry into Europe.

However, within hours of its departure, strong waves battered the overcrowded boat, causing it to capsize. Out of the 65 passengers, at least 46 people drowned, including 16 Pakistanis.

Survivors reported that most of the deceased Pakistanis were from Punjab, Gujranwala, and Sialkot regions -- areas notorious for large-scale migration attempts.  

This devastating incident is not an isolated one. It represents a larger and more complex issue of illegal immigration from Pakistan to Europe, a problem fuelled by unemployment, poverty, lack of opportunities, and the illusion of a promising life in Europe.  
  
According to the latest 2025 European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) report, Pakistan now ranks fifth among the countries with the highest number of illegal immigrants to Europe.

This alarming rise has surpassed traditional migration hotspots like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, placing Pakistan alongside countries like Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq -- nations plagued by conflict and economic instability.  

The primary route taken by illegal immigrants from Pakistan to Europe often begins in major cities such as Lahore, Gujranwala, and Sialkot, where human traffickers operate networks promising a secure and prosperous life in Europe.

Desperate families often sell their property, jewellery, and savings to pay hefty sums to these traffickers, who then facilitate their illegal journey through land and sea routes.  

The most common route involves travelling from Pakistan to Iran by land, crossing the border into Turkey through treacherous mountainous terrain, moving towards the Libyan coast through smuggling networks, and boarding overcrowded, unsafe vessels from Libya to Italy, Greece, or Malta.  

However, many migrants never make it to their destination, falling victim to drownings, extortion, or captivity in detention camps operated by militias or criminal organisations in Libya.  
 
The rise in illegal immigration from Pakistan can be attributed to a combination of socio-economic, political, and cultural factors that push individuals to embark on life-threatening journeys.  
  
With unemployment rates hovering around 7% in 2025 and inflation reaching record highs, many young Pakistanis find it impossible to secure sustainable jobs in their homeland.

Skilled and unskilled workers alike are unable to make ends meet, pushing them to seek opportunities abroad, especially in Europe.  

Moreover, the lure of higher wages, improved living standards, and the potential to financially support their families motivates many to pursue illegal migration, even at the cost of their lives.

A major contributor to the illegal immigration crisis is the well-organised human trafficking network operating in Pakistan.

These traffickers, locally known as ""agents"" or ""dalals"", exploit vulnerable individuals by promising them high-paying jobs in Europe.  

The agents typically charge anywhere between $6,000 to $10,000 per person, claiming they will safely transport migrants to Europe.

However, these journeys often turn deadly, as migrants are crammed into overcrowded boats or left stranded in detention camps along the way.  
  
A significant portion of migrants come from rural areas of Punjab, where there is limited awareness about the dangers of illegal immigration.

Pakistani families are often misled into believing that their sons will find high-paying jobs in Italy, France, or Germany.  

Moreover, social pressure to ""send someone abroad"" has become deeply embedded in local culture.

Families see having a member settled in Europe as a symbol of status and financial success. This cultural phenomenon has intensified the desire for illegal migration.  
 
Pakistan's inability to crack down on human trafficking networks also exacerbates the crisis.

Despite promises from successive governments, law enforcement agencies have failed to dismantle these trafficking rings operating in major cities.  

Additionally, border security along the Iran-Pakistan border remains porous, allowing traffickers to easily transport groups of illegal migrants into Iran. This negligence has perpetuated the illegal immigration crisis.  
  
The surge in illegal migration from Pakistan has placed immense pressure on European Union (EU) countries, especially Italy, Greece, and Spain.

According to Frontex's 2025 report, nearly 38,000 Pakistanis have entered Europe illegally in the past 18 months, a staggering increase from previous years.  

The EU, already grappling with migrants from war-torn countries like Syria and Afghanistan, now faces the additional challenge of managing economic migrants from countries like Pakistan.

European countries have implemented stricter border controls, increased deportations, and cracked down on smuggling networks, but the inflow remains unabated.  

In response, the EU has pressured Pakistan to take greater responsibility for curbing illegal migration.

In March, the EU threatened to impose economic sanctions if Pakistan failed to control the surge in illegal migration, further straining diplomatic relations between Islamabad and Brussels.  
 
Last month's boat tragedy in Libya serves as a chilling reminder of the human cost associated with illegal migration.

Among the 65 passengers, the 16 Pakistanis who lost their lives were primarily from Punjab and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) -- regions where migration trends are the highest.  

Families of the deceased were left devastated after receiving news of their loved ones' deaths.

Many reported selling their property or taking loans to finance the journey, only to be met with tragedy.  

Survivors recalled how they were held in Libyan detention camps for weeks, tortured by smugglers, and then crammed into unseaworthy boats with no life jackets.

Sharing his experience, one survivor, Kashif from Sialkot, said, ""We knew we might die, but we had no future in Pakistan. We were ready to risk it all.""
  
The tragic incident off the coast of Libya in February 2025 highlights the human cost of illegal migration and the complex socio-economic factors driving thousands of Pakistanis to embark on deadly journeys.

The boat tragedy and Pakistan's new ranking as the fifth-highest illegal migrant contributor to Europe demand urgent policy changes and international collaboration. (European Times)"

He made the proposals during the budget committee stage debate on the environment sector and related topics.

Conducting a National Environmental System Assessment

The Opposition Leader emphasized the need for a national environmental system assessment to raise public awareness about the value of biodiversity within the country's ecosystem. He highlighted the importance of understanding the services ecosystems provide and their role in sustaining human existence. He noted that while short-term solutions are often proposed for environmental issues, conservation targets must be established based on Sri Lanka's geographical location. He also reaffirmed that Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and Samagi Jana Sandhanaya (SJS) are green political parties committed to environmental conservation.

Reference to the Environmental Planning Charter

Describing Sri Lanka as a nation that must implement sustainable development within a naturally rich ecosystem, Premadasa tabled the environmental plan and charter he had introduced during the 2019 presidential election. This charter includes details of three major national projects focused on the conservation of elephants, tigers, and whales.

Need for a National Land Development and Physical Plan

Premadasa stressed the importance of a national land development plan and a national physical plan to strengthen environmental protection. He called for broad consensus on this matter and highlighted the necessity of appreciating biodiversity resources for conservation. He also urged action on issues such as environmental pollution, plastic waste reduction, soil erosion prevention, and unauthorized deforestation.

Emphasizing Sustainable and Community-Centered Conservation

Premadasa underscored that as Sri Lanka moves toward a circular economy, sustainable development and conservation must be prioritized. He stated that community-centered conservation is essential for the success of wildlife conservation efforts. He pointed out that while Sri Lanka has committed to multiple environmental charters over the years, the country has yet to achieve many of its conservation targets.

Developing Eco-Tourism

Premadasa proposed eco-tourism as a means of generating foreign exchange. He referenced India's 1971-72 tiger conservation program under Indira Gandhi, which led to a thriving tiger-focused tourism industry and a revival of the tiger population. He suggested that Sri Lanka should similarly develop green tourism initiatives centered on elephants, tigers, dolphins, and whales.

Providing Sustainable Solutions to the Human-Elephant Conflict

Addressing the human-elephant conflict, Premadasa acknowledged that past solutions have been ineffective. He pointed out that while successful technological methods exist worldwide to mitigate conflicts between humans and wildlife, Sri Lanka has struggled to implement a comprehensive wildlife conservation strategy. He attributed this failure to the lack of a clear long-term plan, inadequate human and physical resources, and frequent policy changes between governments and ministers.

Prioritizing Animal Welfare

Premadasa emphasized the importance of animal welfare, calling for a humanitarian approach to conservation efforts. He proposed establishing an International University for Environmental Studies to leverage global green trends and position Sri Lanka as a leader in environment-centered research. He further suggested transforming Sri Lanka into a global research hub for national parks and wildlife conservation.

Developing Physical and Human Resources in the Wildlife Sector

Premadasa called for the permanent employment of experienced wildlife officers who currently work as volunteers on minimal salaries. He also advocated for the regularization of thousands of employees in the multi-functional department who receive a monthly allowance of Rs. 22,500. Additionally, he stressed the need for an accurate wildlife census and criticized any attempts to undermine its significance.

Through these proposals, Premadasa underscored the urgent need for comprehensive, long-term policies to protect Sri Lanka's environment and wildlife, ensuring sustainable conservation and economic benefits through eco-tourism and biodiversity preservation. (Newswire)"

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/17/factum-perspective-duterte-under-arrest/,2025-03-17,Factum Perspective : Duterte Under Arrest,"By Jayson Cainglet

At 09:20 (Manila Time) on the morning of March 11, 2025, the Prosecutor General of the International Criminal Court served an arrest warrant for crimes against humanity on former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.

14 hours later, the plane that would bring Mr Duterte to the Hague in the Netherlands left the country, making him the first Asian former head of state to be arrested by the ICC.

The event marks a pivotal moment for justice and accountability in Asia. It was a day of reckoning for the thousands killed and their families, for the survivors and witnesses who courageously narrated their stories in whispers at the height of Mr Duterte's bloody war against his own people.

It was a day that those who stood up against the six-year carnage thought would never come - the human rights defenders, journalists, community organizations, the clergy, public interest lawyers, forensic experts, and ordinary citizens that fearlessly chronicled each case that now runs in the thousands, and which formed the basis of the ICC's case against Mr Duterte.

The Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC stated that Mr Duterte has been arrested in the context of the Office's ongoing investigation into the situation of the country. It added that on the basis of its independent and impartial investigations, Mr Duterte, as founder and head of the Davao Death Squad when he was the Mayor of Davao City, and subsequently as the President of the Philippines, was

""... criminally responsible for the crime against humanity of murder [Article 7(1)(a) of the Rome Statute] committed in the Philippines between November 1, 2011 and March 16, 2019.""

The statement further read that ""Mr Duterte is alleged to have committed these crimes as part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population.""

A day after his arrival at the ICC, Duterte appeared in court for the first time to confirm his identity and for the Court to hear that the suspect understood the crime which he is alleged to have committed, and that he understood the rights he is entitled under the Rome Statute - the Court's founding treaty.

The Philippine Commission on Human Rights (CHR) welcomed the arrest from the ICC as it underscores that due process is an integral pillar of justice where the voices of the victims can finally be heard.

""A fair and impartial legal process is essential in uncovering the truth and, ultimately, holding perpetrators accountable, should guilt be established,"" the CHR stated.

Human rights groups and media organizations have placed the number of victims of extra judicial killings during Duterte's administration between 20,000 and 30,000.

The Philippine governments' own Justice Department has so far reviewed 5,000 cases. But only eight policemen have been convicted to date, and only because these were celebrated cases that exposed the impunity and moral depravity of the so-called War on Drugs.

Official police records, on the other hand, would show a significantly lower figure: some 6,000 suspects killed in his war on drugs.

Start of the healing process

For victims of Duterte's so-called Drug War, his arrest marks a step toward justice and the start of their journey for inner peace and acceptance.

For now, they await the arrest of Duterte's conspirators who carried out the War in impoverished communities, against petty drug pushers, peddlers, and users whose names were included on a fabricated drug watch list, against his political opponents, and against hapless women and children who were killed in the War as ""collateral damage."" A final verdict is expected to take several years, but for the kin and survivors of Duterte's killing spree, it will be worth the wait.

Duerte's incarceration at The Hague is already seen as a victory for the global human rights community, as it sends a strong message that ruthless leaders cannot keep their reign of terror with impunity, and that they can be held to account.

Duterte's arrest also cements the relevance of the ICC in current global politics given the criticisms it has been receiving from US President Donald Trump, who called it ""ineffective"" and ""biased"" against the United States and its allies, and the usual attacks coming from Russia and China.

Duterte's arrest could also inspire similar pursuit of justice for abuses in other Asian countries and an increased pressure on governments to address human rights violations, especially in Myanmar, Cambodia, and Sri Lanka.

While ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan has acknowledged the criticism surrounding the ICC's effectiveness in enforcing arrest warrants especially on high-profile leaders such as Russia's Vladimir Putin and Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu, he underscores the substantial value that international law holds. Its effectiveness however, hinges upon the international community's cooperation.

""But international law is not weak as some may think. When we come together, when we build partnerships, the rule of law can prevail,"" Khan said.

If convicted, Duterte will be the first Asian leader to be meted a sentence by the ICC. But the trial may last anywhere from 2-8 years.

VOA employees working on a contractual basis on Sunday received an email informing them that they were being terminated effective March 31.

In the email, which was seen by Al Jazeera, the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM) said contractors must ""cease all work immediately"" and were ""not permitted to access any agency buildings or systems"".

""Contractors, including myself, at Voice of America have just received an email notifying us that our contracts will be terminated effective March 31, 2025,"" Misha Komadovsky, the White House correspondent for VOA's Russian-language service, said in a post on X.

The move came after Trump on Friday signed an executive order to effectively eliminate USAGM, which also hosts Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia, along with six other federal agencies.

In a statement, The White House said the move would ""ensure taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda"" and listed a series of criticisms of VOA by conservative media and lawmakers.

Trump's directive is the latest in a series of moves to draw condemnation from media freedom advocacy groups, including Reporters Without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists, which branded the latest order ""dystopian"".

Last month, the Trump administration began barring The Associated Press news agency from events over its refusal to use ""Gulf of America"" as the name for the Gulf of Mexico, and announced that it would decide which journalists and media organisations can participate in media pools.

VOA and other US-funded outlets have long faced accusations of liberal bias from Trump and his allies, including cost-cutting tsar Elon Musk, who last month claimed the broadcasters were made up of ""radical left crazy people talking to themselves"".

During Trump's first term, the White House accused VOA of ""speaking for America's adversaries - not its citizens"".

In 2020, a federal judge ruled that Trump-appointed USAGM CEO Michael Pack acted unconstitutionally by investigating its journalists over their alleged bias.

Brian Padden, a former VOA bureau chief in South Korea and Indonesia who retired in 2020, said it was ""galling"" to hear the Trump administration accuse VOA of disseminating anti-US propaganda.

""In the course of my reporting, I have been shot at, roughed up, and even nearly decapitated by an exploding helicopter in Eastern Ukraine,"" Padden said on Facebook on Sunday.

""In 2014, I was harassed by Pro-Russian activists or militants in Ukraine who accused me and my VOA TV crew of being agents of pro-American propaganda.

Both Musk and the Russian militants are wrong. VOA does not do propaganda. VOA reports the news, which includes the perspective of both proponents and critics of the president.""

Since Friday's executive order, VOA's broadcasts have gone quiet or been replaced by music in multiple regions, including parts of Asia and the Middle East.

Established during World War II to combat propaganda from Nazi Germany, VOA operated in more than 40 languages and claimed a weekly audience of more than 354 million people worldwide. (Al Jazeera)"

Explaining Sri Lanka's debt situation during a televised interview, Talal Rafi said Rs. 700 billion equals eight expressways from Colombo to Katunayake.

""This is the amount we are borrowing on a monthly level for the government to sustain. This is not the fault of the present government or the previous government. This is the way Sri Lanka has been functioning,"" the Director at Ernst & Young said.

Touching on Gross Financing Needs, he explained that this was the amount of financing Sri Lanka needs in a year to sustain itself and that this includes interest, maturity, and the Fiscal Deficit.

He elaborated that at the peak of the 2022 economic crisis, Gross Financing Needs were 32% and per the latest IMF report have now dropped to 25%, a drop of 24.9%.

""This indicates that one-quarter of Sri Lanka's economy has to be paid/ financed each year for Sri Lanka to sustain,"" Talal Rafi said.

Stating that he was also of the opinion that the government should not borrow, he added that, however, the current and previous governments did not have a choice but to borrow.

""If you stop borrowing, then 25% of the GDP has to be paid per year. That is not sustainable. Even if you double VAT to 36%, Income Tax to 72%, or Corporate Tax to 60%, we still cannot finance it without borrowing. The truth is that is the way forward, as our rollover debt is too high as a quarter,"" he said.

Talal Rafi pointed out that Sri Lanka can only solve this by addressing its Fiscal Deficit, adding that the country cannot continue with its expenditure being more than its revenue.

""The solution is something that will be extremely unpopular, to bring the deficit down or to zero. But this will lead to either an increase in revenue, such as people paying taxes, which is unfair to them. Or reducing expenditure which is not going to be popular with people who are receiving it,"" he said.

Talal Rafi noted that Sri Lanka, including the current or any future government, is caught in this situation, but the solution would be to increase revenue and downsize wasteful expenditure of the government, including getting rid of some unproductive sectors. (Newswire)

The Petitioners, Charith Asalanka and Dhanajaya De Silva as the respective captains of the One Day International and Twenty20 cricket teams and the Test Cricket Team, had their petition taken up before the Acting President of the Court of Appeal Justice M.T.M. Lafar and Hon. Justice K. P. Fernando today.

The Petition was preferred by the cricketers in relation to an arbitrary and unreasonable overnight classification of Sri Lanka's national cricketers as employees of the national association, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) by the Inland Revenue Department.

The Petitioners filed the petition seeking for notice to quash the decision of the Inland Revenue Department and an interim order to suspend the decision of the Inland Revenue Department.

A letter signed by 38 national cricketers, including players Wanindu Hasaranga, Angelo Mathews, Maheesh Theekshana, Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis setting out the grievance and endorsing the Petitioners to seek appropriate legal redress on the unlawful classification was also placed before Court.

On behalf of Petitioners, it was submitted that Sri Lanka's cricketers have been historically treated as independent service providers and in fact they cannot be construed to be employees and from the first instance of adoption of contracts between SLC and players, national cricketers have been treated as independent service providers between the parties.

It was submitted that the intention of the parties being a cricketer and SLC, at all times, was that the national cricketers were independent service providers to SLC and not employees.

The Court's attention was drawn to the contract and the uncertainty involved with career progression of cricketers and also that there was no certainty in a Contract being offered.

Further it was submitted that Sri Lanka Cricket as per the contract with a player, implements the International Cricket Councils (ICC) rules in the interest of the game. Counsel for the Petitioners further drew the attention of Court to the nature of the contractual terms between the parties that involved significant uncertainty as to renewal, tenure and payments which was not a salary but a fee. It was further submitted that the contracts between players and SLC also facilitates the use of image rights of players and at all times such right is to be vested with the player as per the contract, which is a necessary requirement for broadcasting of matches and facilitating global cricket events. After almost 15 years of contracts between SLC and players, identifying national cricketers as independent service providers, the Inland Revenue Department by a letter in October 2024 had arbitrarily and unreasonably informed SLC of its categorization of national cricketers as employees of SLC without the Cricketers being given a hearing or being informed to make representations and directed SLC to make appropriate statutory deductions. It was further submitted that players were informed of this change in classification in or around February 2025 by SLC and prior to the Petitioners instituting action challenging the decision of the Inland Revenue Department, the cricketers obtained had obtained legal opinion as to their rights, and the said opinion was placed before the Court.

It was further submitted that as contracts with SLC are often only for twelve months, it is now the period of contract re-negotiation and the arbitrary change in classification plunges the national cricketers into uncertainty regarding their contracts and relevant statutory entitlements. It was submitted that the challenged decision also impacts cricketers who are attached to the police, army and other entities. It was further submitted that the national cricketers were not of the opinion that SLC should be burdened with having to provide statutory entitlements such as EPF and ETF or gratuity and were not seeking such entitlements. It was submitted to Court that the Players are not seeking to avoid paying of any tax when in fact most of the cricketers have been paying their taxes through self-assessment over a period of time and that the Auditor General has also conceded that cricketers were Independent Service Providers and not employees.

On behalf of SLC, it informed to Court that SLC was in agreement with the factual position taken by the Petitioners in respect of not being employees of Sri Lanka Cricket and that they are independent service providers. On behalf of SLC it was informed to Court that they wish to make submissions on the matter and will abide by any order of the Court.

The matter was fixed to be resumed for Petitioner's to continue to make submissions and the Respondents' reply submissions on 28th March 2025.

Pramodya sets the Record Straight,"Former Sri Lankan cricketer and President of Matara Sports Club, Pramodya Wickramasinghe, has addressed concerns over the proposed Matara International Cricket Training School and Stadium, stating that the project has been misrepresented.

He explained that the initiative is not an international stadium, but a High-Performance Center (HPC) aimed at developing young cricketers in the Southern Province. The move aligns with Sri Lanka Cricket's (SLC) vision of establishing first-class cricket grounds in every district and HPCs in every province.

Full Statement

Setting the Record Straight on the Matara High-Performance Cricket Center

Recent discussions regarding the proposed Matara International Cricket Training School and Stadium have sparked various opinions, including concerns raised by former cricketer Roshan Mahanama. As someone deeply involved in cricket development in the Southern Province, I, Pramodya Wickramasinghe, would like to clarify the true purpose and objectives of this initiative.

Matara has historically been a breeding ground for talented cricketers, producing national-level players over the years. However, in recent times, the region's contribution to the national cricketing pipeline has declined. One of the major reasons for this is the lack of a dedicated, well-maintained cricket facility that can support the continuous development of young players. The Uyanwatte Stadium, the main cricketing venue in Matara, is a multi-purpose ground used for various sports, making it difficult to maintain the turf at the standard required for first-class cricket. Despite many politicians, including Ministers, Deputy Ministers, and Members of Parliament, being involved in the Matara District Cricket Association (DCA) over the years, none have successfully addressed this issue to date.

As the President of the Matara Sports Club, I became acutely aware of these challenges and the urgent need to address them. Coincidentally, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) had been exploring the establishment of High-Performance Centers (HPC) in every province to enhance cricketing infrastructure across the country. SLC's National Pathway Program envisions a first-class level ground in every district and an HPC in every province. Therefore, this development will cover both requirements for the district of Matara and the Southern Province. Given that Galle International Stadium faces restrictions due to UNESCO heritage site regulations and the Mahinda Rajapaksa International Cricket Stadium (MRICS) in Hambantota is situated far from Colombo, I proposed that Matara be considered as the location for the Southern Province's High-Performance Center.

To facilitate this initiative, I brought the matter to the attention of Hon. Sunil Handunneththi, who is the President of the Matara District Development Committee, a suitable land was allocated for the project. However, certain individuals within the cricketing fraternity, in an apparent attempt to claim undue credit, misrepresented this initiative as the construction of an international cricket stadium. This misinformation has unfortunately led to unwarranted criticism from personalities such as Roshan Mahanama, who may not have been fully informed of the project's actual scope and intent.

It is essential to emphasize that this is not a venture aimed at building an extravagant stadium but rather an initiative to develop a structured, high-performance facility that will serve as a training and development hub for young cricketers in the Southern Province. The development of high-performance sporting infrastructure is a key aspect highlighted in the Sports Policy of the incumbent government. By establishing such centers across the country, SLC aims to provide equal opportunities for aspiring cricketers, allowing them to hone their skills without having to relocate to Colombo or other major cities. Additionally, this development will enable schools and clubs of the Southern Province to access top-tier training facilities that were previously unavailable. It will also allow Sri Lanka A team matches and other second-tier fixtures to be hosted in Matara, further enhancing the region's cricketing significance.

Furthermore, the High-Performance Center will not only focus on cricketing skills but also provide training in non-cricketing disciplines such as sports medicine, IT, personality development, English proficiency and skill development, cricketing rules, coaching aptitude, coach education, physiotherapy, and strength & conditioning. These are disciplines which are lacking in the ongoing output of players. The objective is to produce well-rounded, high-performing cricketers who can contribute to the national system at various levels.

I urge all stakeholders, including former cricketers and the public, to understand the genuine need for this project and the positive impact it will have on cricket development in the region. Constructive dialogue based on facts rather than misinformation will ensure that Sri Lanka's cricketing future is strengthened through well-planned and well-executed initiatives.

Let us work together towards the true development of our cricketing infrastructure, focusing on the future of our young talent rather than being swayed by misconceptions.

The withdrawal comes after the Attorney General had filed a motion with the court stating that the Indian company Adani had informed the Chairman of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI) in writing that it would withdraw the relevant project.

Following this, the petitioner today withdrew their FR petition filed at the Supreme Court.

The petition was filed by the Wildlife Nature Protection Society (WNPS) challenging the cabinet decision announced in May 2024 on the Adani deal.

Commenting on the petition, WNPS said it withdrew its legal petition before the Supreme Court following confirmation that Adani Green Energy has officially withdrawn from the proposed Mannar Island wind power project.

In a statement, WNPS said during today's hearing, the Attorney General's Department submitted a letter dated February 12, 2025, from Adani Green Energy to the Board of Investment (BOI), stating their decision to pull out of the project. It was further submitted by the Deputy Solicitor General that the withdrawal was further confirmed through direct communication between the Ministry of Energy and Adani's local agent. As a result, WNPS, through its legal counsel, moved to withdraw its application.

Mannar Island is a globally significant ecological hotspot, serving as a critical stopover along the Central Asian Flyway, where millions of migratory birds from over 30 countries travel annually. Scientific research, including satellite-assisted tracking, has underscored the island's irreplaceable role in global bird migration, biodiversity conservation, and Sri Lanka's thriving wildlife tourism industry. WNPS has long warned that the proposed wind farm would have caused severe ecological and socio-economic disruptions, violating international conservation commitments and threatening local communities.

This outcome marks a significant victory in the ongoing efforts to protect Mannar Island's fragile ecosystem. WNPS remains steadfast in its commitment to ensuring that all future development projects prioritize environmental sustainability and adhere to rigorous scientific assessments. The Society will continue to monitor the situation closely and take necessary action should any attempt be made to revive the project.

WNPS had filed the petition challenging the Cabinet decision to award the tender to the Adani Group, authorizing the Government of Sri Lanka to enter into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Adani at a rate of 8.26 US cents per kWh unit for the next 20 years.

If implemented, the Adani wind power project would have marked the largest renewable energy investment in Sri Lanka, valued at US$1 billion.

It was proposed to be the country's largest wind power plant, with a capacity of 484 MW, expected to be completed in record time. (Newswire)"

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/18/sri-lankas-first-waste-to-energy-power-plant-turns-mountains-of-trash-into-clean-electricity/,2025-03-18,Sri Lanka's first waste-to-energy power plant turns mountains of trash into clean electricity,"In the densely populated Western Province of Sri Lanka, the disposal of solid waste has been a dirty - and dangerous - problem.

Thirty-two people were killed in the collapse of a mountain of waste at the Meethotamulla open dumping site in the Colombo District seven years ago. The pile of rotting debris had shifted from flooding and a fire before it collapsed and buried dozens of people living in nearby homes.

Even without such tragic disasters unfolding, untreated solid waste causes unhealthy air pollution as it decomposes, releasing harmful gasses into the air including highly flammable methane. It poisons the soil and groundwater as well.

Today, Sri Lanka's Western Province, home to more than six million people, still produces 3,500 metric tons of household waste every day. That's the equivalent of a stack of  2,600 compact cars or 13,000 motorcycles every day.

To tackle the persistent problem of solid waste disposal, the Western Power Company Ltd, a subsidiary of Aitken Spence PLC, launched the nation's first waste-to-energy power plant.

Opened in 2021, the waste-to-energy power plant incinerates 600 to 800 metric tons of waste each day and supplies 10 megawatts of electricity to the national grid.

Residue ash left over from the incineration at the plant is repurposed to produce cinder blocks for the construction industry, and the flue gas is treated to remove harmful particles before it is released into the air.

Aitken Spence gives considerable credit for its sustainability vision to the UN Global Compact, to which it has been a signatory since 2002. Over the last 22 years, the company has participated in many UN Global Compact programmes including the Climate Emergency Task Force, Gender & Diversity, Business & Human Rights and the Sustainable Supply Chain Working Groups as well as several Climate Ambition Accelerators along with the Target Gender Equality Accelerator, Business & Human Rights Accelerator and the SDG Innovation Accelerator.

Building of the waste-to-energy plant meant overcoming unforeseen challenges, including interest rate fluctuations that caused financial losses, a failure of some promised support systems and a financial crisis that led to depreciation of the local currency, the company said.

Former Prime Minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa has called its construction ""a milestone in the solid waste management process not only in the city of Colombo, but in entire Sri Lanka.""

The concept of a waste-to-energy power plant was first proposed in 2012, and it was fast-tracked by the government in the wake of the 2017 Meethotamulla disaster.

The power plant so far has sustainably repurposed more than 815,000 metric tons of municipal solid waste into energy for the national grid.

""Otherwise it all would have ended up in an open dump, which would have caused several environmental consequences especially on  climate change,"" said R. Shanmugapriya, Assistant Director (Tech and Training) at the Waste Management Authority of the Western Province.

""This plant has found a permanent solution to a national issue of waste management and most  importantly helped to preserve the surrounding environment, wetlands and waterways for the future.""

The waste-to-energy process also has helped protect the sensitive Muthurajawela wetland ecosystem that has been threatened by solid waste collection.

""For years, waste disposal had become a severe problem,especially in the Western Province,"" said Shahina Mysan, Director of Engineering (Solid Waste Management) at the Colombo Municipal Council.

""This municipal solid waste was accumulating in landfills, polluting both the ground water and the environment,and spreading diseases. Moreover, the municipal solid waste was accumulating in a sensitive wetland ecosystem which cannot be valued,"" Mysan said.

""The waste-to-energy power plant has not only ensured the safe disposal of the municipal solid waste, it has also safeguarded our wetlands and their own ecosystems in the surrounding areas of the Western Province for the future generations of our country.""

Rathika de Silva, Executive Director, UN Global Compact Network Sri Lanka, noted that Aitken Spence was one of the first companies to join the UN Global Compact Network Sri Lanka.

""Their dedication has not only fueled their business growth but has also positioned them as trailblazers in innovation, exemplified by their pioneering Waste-to-Energy project,"" de Silva said. ""I commend them for their boldness and creativity in championing sustainability, and basing their strategic decisions on scientific data."" (UN Global Compact)"

In a press conference at the National Palace in Mexico City, Sheinbaum claimed she didn't know who told the hacker about her phone and email.

The New York Times, in its report on Sunday, stated that the president's phone was hacked after Sheinbaum's government took a bold step by extraditing 29 drug dealers to the United States on February 27.

Sheinbaum stated that Apple has communicated with Mexico's digital transformation department, which is aware of the hacking, and measures have been taken to restore the hacked phone and email.

The president revealed that the phone was a gift from a former senator and Campeche Governor, Layda Sansores. Sheinbaum also said her phone number was circulated during the campaign as an expression of affection.

The Mexican president added that the hacked phone and email address are no longer used for personal communication and correspondence.

Sheinbaum used the phone as the Tlalpan environmental delegate in Mexico City long before she became a presidential candidate or head of the capital government.

The phone was widely circulated by the people of Mexico City and was published in local media last year, before the general election in June 2024. She said they are investigating the hacked phone.

A New York Times article explained in detail the call between Sheinbaum and U.S. President Donald Trump, where they mediated a deal that saved Mexican goods from a 25 percent tariff for another month.

Trump reportedly praised Sheinbaum while admonishing Justin Trudeau, then the prime minister of Canada, for publicly opposing Trump's tariff threats against his neighbor.

Sheinbaum affirmed that she doesn't know who leaked the phone call with President Trump. She said the hacker was untraceable, which led to the press conference at the National Palace. (NYT)"

Peiris continued, ""This suspect, during his tenure as IGP, once claimed that lawyers protect criminals. Yet today, he himself has surrounded himself with lawyers to appear before court. Your Honour, this is not just the case regarding the W15 hotel shooting. This is an instance of karmic justice in action. He does not need an explanation about the law of karma--he is experiencing it firsthand.""

Addressing Tennakoon's alleged attempts to evade arrest, Peiris said, ""Your Honour, after the arrest warrant was issued, a massive police operation was launched to find him--just as if we were searching for Prabhakaran. He has used his social and religious influence to evade arrest until yesterday. The address listed as his residence is actually occupied by a Buddhist monk. Over the past few days, police have questioned officials, politicians, and others regarding his whereabouts. He has made deals with influential people. When police searched his house, they found 795 bottles of liquor worth over a hundred million rupees. There were also over 100 hampers. Government employees cannot even get simple gift packs, so how did he obtain these? His house is not just a home--it is distillery. No property is registered in his name, yet he owns around eight houses. That is why I say he is even more dangerous than organized criminals. He is a ghost""

He urged the court to reject Tennakoon's bail request, saying, ""Given his position and the nature of the charges, there is a risk that the suspect could obstruct the investigation if released.""

President's Counsel Shanaka Ranasinghe, appearing for Tennakoon, said, ""After the arrest warrant was issued, my client filed a case before the Court of Appeal seeking relief. Since that request was rejected, he voluntarily appeared before the court this morning.""

""This suspect, as the Inspector General of Police, led a major operation under the name of 'Yukthiya' Through this operation, a large number of individuals involved in criminal activities were arrested and are currently in prison. Therefore, if this suspect is to be remanded, his safety must be ensured""

After reviewing the arguments, the Matara Magistrate's Court ruled that Tennakoon would be remanded until March 20, when a decision on his bail application would be announced. (NewsWire)"

According to Thailand's Tourism and Sports Ministry, the decision is taken to curb the risk of illegal businesses exploiting the visa exemption scheme.

However, additional details would be discussed before formally announcing the change to the regulation.

Since July 2024, the government has allowed passport holders from 93 countries to enter Thailand for tourism purposes for a period of up to 60 days.

However, tourism operators expressed concern over the extended period as long-haul tourists typically stayed for only 14-21 days on average, while short-haul travellers spent less than two weeks per trip or around seven days on average.

The Association of Thai Travel Agents earlier raised this concern with the ministry as there is a growing number of foreigners illegally working or doing businesses in the country, while the Thai Hotels Association believed this was partly to blame for the increase in the number of condos being illegally rented out to guests on a daily basis.

The ministry said a special joint operational centre has investigated illicit activities in Phuket, Chiang Mai, Pattaya, Hua Hin, Koh Samui and Bangkok. (Newswire)"

On average, every 14th infostealer infection results in stolen credit card information, with nearly 26 million devices compromised by infostealers, including more than 9 million in 2024 alone. Kaspersky released its report on the infostealer threat landscape while the technology world gathers at MWC 2025 in Barcelona.

The number of infections with data-stealing malware, 2020-2024 (Source: Kaspersky Digital Footprint Intelligence)

Kaspersky experts estimate that approximately 2,300,000 bank cards have been leaked on the dark web. This conclusion is based on an analysis of the log files from data-stealing malware, dated 2023-2024, that were leaked on the dark web market. While globally the share of leaked cards is well below one percent, 95% of the observed numbers appear technically valid.

Infostealer malware is not only designed to extract financial information, but also credentials, cookies and other valuable user data, which is compiled into log files and then distributed within the dark web underground community. An infostealer can infect a device if a victim unknowingly downloads and runs a malicious file, for example one disguised as legitimate software, such as a game cheat. It can be spread through phishing links, compromised websites, malicious attachments in emails or messengers and various other methods. It targets both personal and corporate devices.

On average, every 14th infostealer infection results in stolen credit card information. Kaspersky Digital Footprint Intelligence experts found that nearly 26 million devices running Windows were infected with various types of infostealers in the past two years.

""The actual number of infected devices is even higher. Cybercriminals often leak stolen data in the form of log files months or even years after the initial infection, and compromised credentials and other information continue to surface on the dark web over time. Therefore, the more time passes, the more infections from previous years we observe. We forecast the total number of devices infected with infostealer malware in 2024 to be between 20 million and 25 million, while for 2023, the estimate ranges between 18 million and 22 million,"" says Sergey Shcherbel, expert at Kaspersky Digital Footprint Intelligence.

In 2024, Redline remained the most widespread infostealer, accounting for 34% of the total number of infections.

The most significant surge in 2024 was in infections caused by Risepro, whose share of total infections increased from 1.4% in 2023 to almost 23% in 2024. ""RisePro is a growing threat. It was first discovered two years ago, but seems to be gaining momentum. The stealer primarily targets banking card details, passwords and cryptocurrency wallet data, and may be spreading under the guise of key generators, cracks for various software and game mods,"" explains Sergey Shcherbel. Another rapidly growing stealer is Stealc, which first appeared in 2023 and increased its share from nearly 3% to 13%.

Learn more in the report. In light of this growing infostealer threats, Kaspersky has launched a dedicated landing page to raise awareness of the issue and provide strategies for mitigating associated risks.

If you encounter a data leak through infostealers, the following steps should be taken immediately: 1. Act promptly if you suspect your bank card details are leaked: monitor bank notifications, reissue the card and change your bank app or website password. Enable two-factor authentication and other verification methods. Some banks allow setting spending limits for added protection. If account and balance details are leaked, be extra vigilant against phishing emails, fraudulent SMS and calls. Cybercriminals might consider you a victim for targeted attacks based on this information. Contact your bank directly in unclear situations. 2. Change compromised account passwords and monitor for suspicious activity associated with those accounts. 3. Run full security scans on all devices, removing any detected malware. 4. Companies are recommended to monitor dark web markets proactively to detect compromised accounts before they pose risks to customers or employees. A detailed guide on setting up monitoring can be found here. Leverage Kaspersky Digital Footprint Intelligence to track what cybercriminals know about your company's assets, identify potential attack vectors, and implement protective measures in a timely manner.

Their initial mission, which was scheduled to last roughly eight days using Boeing's Starliner Spacecraft was launched in June 2024 but due to technical issues with the Starliner, including issues with the propulsion system and helium leaks, their safe return was prevented causing a prolonged stay on the ISS for the astronauts.

However, with the issues in the spacecraft, William and Wilmore were forced to remain on the ISS for nine whole months while NASA and Boeing assessed possible solutions.

Also commenting on the Batalanda Commission Report, the General Secretary of the United National Party (UNP), Thalatha Athukorala said that the investigations must first summon Minister K.D. Lal Kantha as a witness.

Speaking during a media briefing, Thalatha Athukorala said Minister Lal Kantha has previously claimed that they have killed informants and persons, including monks, who had given evidence against them.

""A person who has made such claims must be the first to be summoned as a witness. We know that nothing will happen through this Commission. Ranil Wickremesinghe is not in Parliament anymore. Why are they so scared of a single individual?"" she questioned.

The Batalanda Commission Report came to the spotlight after former President Ranil Wickremesinghe's controversial interview with international media, Al Jazeera recently.

Thereafter, the 'Batalanda Commission Report' was tabled in Parliament by the government last week.

Addressing the Parliament, the Leader of the House, Minister Bimal Rathnayake said a policy decision has been taken by the Cabinet and President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to take action regarding the Batalanda Commission Report.

Minister Rathnayake further said that a decision has been taken to forward the report to the Attorney General for necessary advice and that the President will appoint a special committee to study the Batalanda Commission report.

The Batalanda Commission was established to investigate allegations of unlawful detention, torture, and extrajudicial killings at the Batalanda Housing Scheme in Sri Lanka between 1988 and 1990, during the JVP insurgency. (Newswire)"

Finance Ministry official and Deputy Minister Harshana Suriyapperuma informed the COPF that the system is such that only around 800,000 out of the approximated 8 million satisfy the tax threshold.

The Committee on Public Finance met in Parliament this week (18 Mar), Chaired by MP Harsha de Silva, to discuss the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill to amend the Inland Revenue Act, No. 24 of 2017.

The tax net of the workforce was discussed when the Committee took into consideration the proposal that Personal Income Tax (PIT) relief be increased from Rs. 1,200,000 per annum to Rs. 1,800,000 per annum under the Bill.

Accordingly, the said Bill also proposes the Income Tax rate on betting and gaming, tobacco and liquor industries to be increased from 40% to 45%.

Furthermore, the export of services will be liable for income tax at the rate of 15% and proposals have also been made that the Withholding Tax (WHT) rate on interest be increased from 5% to 10%.

Considering the PAYE data analysis in-depth, the Committee on Public Finance concluded that there is an error in the existing data. Accordingly, the Committee Chair directed the officials to provide an accurate data analysis to the Committee.

Moreover, it was also disclosed at the Committee on Public Finance that the implementation of obtaining a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) is essential for paying taxes / importing/exporting or obtaining any services from the Inland Revenue is not functioning. The Committee instructed the officials present to update the Committee on the status regarding the smooth execution of the process.

Considering the proposal on the Income Tax rate on betting and gaming, tobacco and liquor industries to be increased from 40% to 45%, the Committee expressed its dissatisfaction over the failure of the Ministry to duly establish a casino regulator. Furthermore, the Committee Chair also expressed its dissatisfaction given that the Inland Revenue Department had failed to provide proper data requested by the Committee previously on the revenue received from Casino operations over the last 5 years.

The Committee also questioned officials present regarding having to pay 25% for tax appeals. The Committee questioned if it is ethical to demand a cash deposit instead of a bank guarantee when making an appeal. Deputy Minister Harshana Suriyapperuma stated that people use the appealing mechanism as a tool to avoid paying revenue due to the government and hence a cash deposit in replace of a bank guarantee has been proposed. The Committee directed the officials to provide data analyzing the cases for better understanding to arrive at a conclusion on the matter. (Newswire)"

In February, the Adani Group officially announced that it had pulled out of further engagement in a $442 million wind power venture in Sri Lanka after the country's authorities attempted to modify the agreement.

Questioning whether the budget would increase the withholding tax rate on the deposits of senior citizens, he said that it was necessary to know the limits on the withholding tax imposed.

MP Premadasa further questioned if there was a method for senior citizens to recover the withholding taxes collected.

The Opposition Leader also requested that a simpler method be adopted as this method will leave senior citizens with low literacy levels helpless.

He pointed out that the previous Yahapalana government provided 15% interest for senior citizens, but the previous government cancelled it.

""The current fixed interest rate is 7.5% and the government has proposed to provide an additional 3%, which should be 15%.

Addressing the Parliament today, MP Harsha de Silva pointed out that currently the revenue generated from cigarette tax for the government is less than that of the revenue generated by the cigarette company.

Stating that a 75 per cent tax must be imposed on cigarettes, which is accepted even by the WHO and UNDP, MP Harsha de Silva said the current methodology followed in Sri Lanka for the imposing of tax on cigarettes was wrong.

""Previously, the Committee stated that the increase in the excise duty on cigarettes cannot be approved without concrete data and called for justification regarding the steps taken to increase the excise duty on cigarettes. It was also pointed out that studies conducted on excise revenue from cigarettes indicate that this calculation method has led to a decline in government revenue while increasing the profits of particular manufacturing companies,"" he said.

MP Harsha de Silva went on to say that the calculation of tax for cigarettes was wrong and the tax has been declining in the past years.

""I propose that the government takes a fresh approach concerning the tax imposed on cigarettes. The government states that based on inflation a 4% tax is imposed on cigarettes. They said as inflation is 1.9%, an addition of 4 % amounts to a 5.9% tax on cigarettes. However, COPF pointed out that last year's inflation was 1.2% and not 1.9% as stated by the government. Therefore, the tax on cigarettes should be 5.2%,"" he said.

Speaking in Parliament, Premadasa said that although the government, in its policy statement (page 165), proposed to add 2000 megawatts of solar power to the national grid, recent decisions taken by the administration contradict this commitment.

Highlighting the importance of solar energy as a key player in renewable and environmentally-friendly power generation, the Opposition Leader questioned why the government's actions have not aligned with its stated policies.

He further inquired about the number of existing coal and diesel power plants in the country, including those not owned by the government, and requested data on the cost of generating one unit of electricity using diesel, coal, hydro, and solar sources. He also asked for a comparison with the cost of purchasing a unit of power from private power plants.

Premadasa sought clarification on the megawatt contributions made to the national grid through various types of power plants and the projected solar power generation under the CEB's long-term generation plan. He emphasised the need to disclose the total installed solar power capacity in the country, including ground-mounted and rooftop solar projects, along with the unit rates paid for these contributions.

The Opposition Leader also questioned how many tenders had been issued for ground-mounted solar power projects and how many had received approval.

Citing a circular issued on March 17, 2025, Premadasa claimed that the current government had imposed limits on solar power systems, which he described as a setback to solar energy production and a betrayal of public trust. (Newswire)"

Speaking during a recent television interview, the former President outlined the fact that the world was witnessing a global power shift towards Asia, with a focus on the Indian Ocean, and as such Sri Lanka must look to capitalise on this.

Commenting on Sri Lanka adopting this ambitious target, the former President stated that to achieve this target the country would need to record a ten-fold growth in its economy over the next 30 years. However, the possibility of doing so remains high, as this is a similar target that India has set for itself in the same period.

The Former President further stated that for Sri Lanka's economy to move beyond its current fragile state, integration and cooperation with the Indian economy must be a priority. He explained that during his tenure in 2022-24, the country explored several avenues of economic cooperation with India including in the fields of renewable energy, agriculture and connectivity with an emphasis on Southern India.

Former President Wickremesinghe criticised the government's failure to proceed with the Adani Group's renewable energy project in Mannar. Highlighting the process undertaken by the Sri Lankan government, including the relevant stakeholders, and the Indian investors, he questioned the rationale behind the NPP government's attempts to re-negotiate an already agreed-upon project.

Raising concerns that this would deter any future large-scale investment projects, the former President urged the government to continue with the policies introduced by his government.

When questioned over whether the IMF program was the only option for Sri Lanka, President Wickremesinghe highlighted that the ability to successfully restructure the debt with the international bondholders and bilateral creditors was reliant on an IMF certification.

Acknowledging that the citizens were still reeling from the economic crisis, the President stated that unless the program was completed further hardship awaited the country down the line. (Newswire)"

In the court filing dated March 5 but only reported by media on Thursday, the social network alleged that the Indian IT Ministry has asked other departments to use a government-run website to issuecontent-blockingg orders.

Why is Musk's X suing the Indian government?

X argued the website, launched by the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs last year, was not subject to the stringent Indian legal safeguards that previously only allowed content removal orders to be issued by top officials and in cases deemed to threaten public order or state sovereignty.

The website creates ""an impermissible parallel mechanism"" that causes ""unrestrained censorship of information in India,"" the social network claimed.

The Indian government is yet to comment.

The case was briefly heard earlier this week in the High Court of India's southern Karnataka state but no final decision was reached. It will now be heard on March 27.

Musk wants to roll out Starlink and Tesla in India

The lawsuit marks an escalation in an ongoing legal dispute between X and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government over how the country polices online content. It also comes as Musk prepares to launch Starlink and Tesla in India.

Musk has reached agreements with two of India's largest telecommunications providers Jio and Bharti Airtel, to role out Starlink broadband across the country but the company still requires government authorization.

The dispute also coincides with threats by US President Donald Trump, to whom Musk acts as a senior adviser, to impose tariffs on Indian goods.

""I believe they're going to probably be lowering those tariffs substantially. But on April 2, we will be charging them the same tariffs they charge us,"" Trump told the American far-right Breitbart news network, calling India ""one of the highest tariffing nations in the world.""

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/21/trump-signs-order-shutdown-us-education-department/,2025-03-21,Trump signs order shutdown US Education Department,"US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an order aimed at shutting down the Department of Education, a decades-old goal of the American right, which wants individual states to run schools free from the influence of federal government.

Surrounded by schoolchildren sitting at desks set up in the East Room of the White House, Trump smiled as held up the order after signing it.

Trump said the order would ""begin eliminating the federal Department of Education once and for all.""

""We're going to shut it down and shut it down as quickly as possible. It's doing us no good,"" Trump said. ""We're going to return education back to the states where it belongs.""

The Education Department, created in 1979, cannot be shuttered without the approval of Congress -- but Trump's order will likely have the power to starve it of funds and staff.

The move is one of the most drastic steps yet in the brutal overhaul of the government that Trump is carrying out with the help of tech tycoon Elon Musk and his Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Democrats and educators have slammed the move.

The top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, called it a ""tyrannical power grab"" and ""one of the most destructive and devastating steps Donald Trump has ever taken.""

Republican leaders, including governors Ron DeSantis of Florida and Greg Abbott of Texas, were in the audience for the signing ceremony.

Trump has cast the move as necessary to save money and improve educational standards in the United States, saying they are lagging behind those in Europe and China. (Fox)"

This is the eighth recall for the model.

The recall of about 46,000 vehicles includes all models that were manufactured from Nov. 13, 2023, when the Cybertruck was first produced, to Feb. 27. In a report filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Tuesday, Tesla said that only about 1 percent of the electric vehicles from this model were defective but that it would recall all the vehicles as a precaution.

As of March 14, Tesla had identified 151 warranty claims that might be related to the trim panel issue, according to the report, but the company said it was ""not aware of any collisions, fatalities or injuries that are or may be related to the condition.""

The announcement marks one of the largest recalls for Cybertrucks in the model's short and at times flawed history on the road. Other issues with the vaunted model have included losing drive power, its front-windshield wiper malfunctioning and an accelerator pedal getting stuck. Cybertrucks sell for about $80,000 to $100,000, depending on customization. (NewYork Times)"

The incident occurred during the 7th over of KKR's innings when Rasikh Salam bowled a sharp bouncer that forced Narine to take evasive action. In the process, his bat clipped the stumps, lighting up the bails. However, the on-field umpires ruled Narine not out and signalled a wide due to the ball's height.

The key detail behind the decision lies in the timing of the contact with the stumps. As per MCC Law 35.2, a batter is only out hit wicket if they break the stumps while playing the ball or starting a run. In this case, Narine's bat hit the stumps after the delivery had already been collected by wicketkeeper Jitesh Sharma, meaning the ball was considered dead and the play complete.

Despite the lucky escape, Narine was eventually dismissed for a quick-fire 44 off 26 balls, but the controversy added early drama to what promises to be an action-packed IPL season. (With inputs from Crictracker)"

Speaking to the media, GMOA spokesman Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe stated that the solution, which aligns with the association's initial request, does not impose any additional financial burden on the state. Instead, doctors have agreed to contribute one-third of their additional duty and holiday payments for the country's benefit.

Initially, as part of the budget proposals, doctors' basic salaries were increased, but the payment rates for additional duty and holiday work were reduced to 1/120 per hour and 1/30 per day. Unhappy with this revision, the GMOA held a series of discussions with the authorities to negotiate a more favorable solution.

Following these discussions, the government has agreed in principle to maintain the previous calculation--1/80 of the basic salary per hour for additional duty and 1/20 per day for holiday work--while paying only two-thirds of the amount, considering the country's economic challenges.

The GMOA emphasized that the issue was resolved through a flexible, discussion-based approach, leading to a positive outcome for medical professionals. (NewsWire)"

Organized by Sri Lanka Muslim Civil Society (SLMCS), Soup Kitchen Sri Lanka, and Team Torrington, the event brought together approximately 2,200 individuals at Independence Square to enjoy the happiness of breaking fast together, transcending religious and social boundaries.

This year's activity was more vibrant than ever with interactive stalls that promoted Islamic culture, including mehendi stalls, hijab try-on stall, calligraphy, and a ""Get to Know Us"" stall. The activity also included interesting performances, making the experience for everyone until the program closed at 7:30 PM.

With the support of 250 volunteers, the activity was still able to serve its function of creating unity. The first ""Street Iftar"" was initiated in 2015 by Soup Kitchen Sri Lanka, and the feeling of oneness persisted despite the difficulties during and after the Easter bombings of 2019 and the economic crisis. After a small event in 2022 during the Aragalaya, the Break-Fast at Sunset resumed full speed in 2023, and has continued to spread even more in influence and scope.

The organizers were deeply moved by the generosity of sponsors, donors, and volunteers who contributed in cash, kind, and time to make this event a success. Special thanks are due to the youth volunteers whose contributions helped add more festivity this year to the event. The officers, staff, and media team who organized the event facilitated it with their assistance for a seamless experience.

Most importantly, the organizers extend their heartfelt gratitude to all who graced the occasion despite the weather. The friendliness and fraternity that were showcased throughout the affair are the quintessence of what Ramadan is really all about humanity, compassion, and empathy rather than religion.

As Sri Lanka continues along its path of development, gatherings like Break-Fast at Sunset serve to remind all that it is only by being united that they will find prosperity. The vision is to continue organizing such gatherings, in which people from all walks of life come together, share, and look after one another not just during Ramadan, but the whole year through.

The Effects of GSP+ Withdrawal on Sri Lanka's Exports and Labour Force,"Growing uncertainties on the future of global trade as President Trump seeks to impose reciprocal tariffs make programmes such as the European Union's Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+) more significant for small exporters such as Sri Lanka.

With a reported visit by EU representatives to assess GSP+, it is important to note that in the absence of the current tariff preferences, Sri Lanka will face a tariff increase up to Most Favoured Nation (MFN) levels, likely resulting in export losses and associated negative labour market effects.

IPS' latest study titled ""Who Stands to Lose? The Effects of GSP+ Withdrawal on Sri Lanka's Exports and Labour Force,"" by IPS Researchers Dr Asanka Wijesinghe, Chaya Dissanayake and Rashmi Anupama estimates the export loss of Sri Lanka due to a hypothetical tariff increase from GSP+ rates to MFN rates.

The study reveals that the tariff hike in the EU-28 will cause an export loss of United States Dollars (USD) 1.23 billion (Bn) or 36.7% of EU-28 bound exports from the base year 2019 exports.

Sri Lanka's wearing apparel and processing fish sectors will be the hardest hit and may face significant export losses. Moreover, the fall in import demand from the EU-28 will make 4.99% of total industrial employees in Sri Lanka vulnerable to adverse labour market outcomes.

This study also points to the differential effect of GSP+ preference erosion on women and low and medium-skilled workers, who account for 65.65% of vulnerable workers.

Some key highlights from the study are the following:

Sri Lanka has a strong economic incentive to comply with the agreed-upon conventions, which is a conditionality of the tariff preference. Despite the variation in utilisation rates, the export effect of preference erosion will be substantial.

Although Sri Lanka may lose the preference with gradual economic growth, at the current growth stage of Sri Lanka, GSP+ is an important tariff preference in promoting growth and generating jobs for women and low and medium-skilled workers in the formal manufacturing sector. The loss of GSP+ at the growth stage with higher average income is a much more manageable loss, rather than a preference erosion at the current stage of growth.

https://www.ips.lk/who-stands-to-lose-the-effects-of-gsp-withdrawal-on-sri-lankas-exports-and-labor-force/


* Although the wearing apparel sector does not utilise the GSP+ fully, the negative effect is large as the EU tariffs can go up by close to ten percentage points in a loss of GSP+ status.
* The EU-28 is a major export destination for relatively high-technology products like transformers, accounting for 50% of Sri Lanka's exports to the world in 2019. Estimates show that after GSP+ withdrawal, Sri Lanka will lose about 10% of exports to the EU-28 in transformers.
* Reduced imports from the EU-28 under MFN tariffs will also make 73,574 workers vulnerable, as per the calculations of embedded employment in the imports by the EU-28.
* Overall, 4.99% of the employment in the affected sectors will be vulnerable to a tariff increase, including 13.47% of workers in the wearing apparel sector.
* The GSP+ preference erosion in the EU-28 market is worrying, with an estimated USD 1.23 Bn or 36.7% export loss of the base year export value for Sri Lanka. GSP+ withdrawal will dwindle Sri Lanka's export value while impeding the diversification of Sri Lanka's export product basket towards products with high technology content."

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/22/ipl-2025-begins-today-4-updates-changes/,2025-03-22,IPL 2025 begins today : 4 updates & changes,"The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) conducted a Captains', Coaches, and Managers' meeting at its headquarters on Thursday, March 20, ahead of the 18th season of the TATA Indian Premier League (IPL).

During the meeting, representatives from all 10 IPL teams provided feedback and opinions on various aspects of the playing conditions. Based on a common consensus, the following updates have been incorporated

1) Use of saliva to shine the ball

Effective from the IPL 2025 season, bowlers will be permitted to use saliva to shine the ball. This decision follows consultations with all 10 teams and marks a return to traditional ball maintenance practices. The ban on the use of saliva, which was originally imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, has now been lifted.

2) Replacement of wet ball to counter dew

To address challenges posed by dew during evening matches, the team bowling second will now have the option to request a ball change once after the 10th over.

The bowling captain can make this request, regardless of whether there is visible dew or not. Once the request is made, the umpires will mandatorily replace the ball with another one of similar wear and tear. The bowling team will not have the liberty to choose the replacement ball.

Additionally, the umpires retain the authority to change the ball at any time before the 10th over if it is deemed too wet, out of shape, lost, or damaged. If a captain requests a ball change in the 11th over due to it being out of shape, the umpires will evaluate the request and approve it if deemed necessary.

If a subsequent request is made after a few overs solely due to dew, the umpires will be required to replace the ball mandatorily as stated earlier.

3) New Code of Conduct

Effective this season, a new Code of Conduct will be implemented from the TATA IPL 2025 season, introducing a demerit points system and suspension points which will remain valid for 36 months.

4) Expansion of DRS Scope:

The Decision Review System (DRS) has been expanded to include height-based no-ball reviews and wide-ball reviews outside the off-stump. The updated system will utilize Hawk-Eye technology and ball-tracking to assist umpires in making accurate and consistent decisions.

Responding to Anadolu's question on the attack, UN spokesperson Farhan Haq told a news conference: ""We certainly are against any of the attacks on medical infrastructure.""

""All attacks against medical infrastructure by any of the parties is a violation of international humanitarian law, and we stand opposed to this,"" he said.

Citing previous Israeli attacks on hospitals in the Gaza Strip - potential war crimes - Haq stressed that it ""is an intolerable situation for the suffering population.""

Since the beginning of the genocide in Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023, the Israeli military has systematically targeted Gaza's health care system - bombing and besieging hospitals, ordering evacuations, and blocking medical supplies, particularly in northern Gaza.

More than 700 Palestinians have been killed and over 900 injured in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza since Tuesday, shattering a ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement that had held since January.

Nearly 50,000 Palestinians have been killed, mostly women and children, and over 112,000 injured in Israel's military onslaught on Gaza since October 2023.

Last November, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.

Israel also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war on the enclave. (Anadolu's News Agency)"

The initiative was part of the Institute's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) efforts and in celebration of its 65th anniversary.

Deniyaya Base Hospital has been facing a critical shortage of essential medical equipment, significantly impacting its ability to provide adequate healthcare services. The lack of diagnostic tools, patient monitors, and life-saving devices posed serious challenges, especially for maternity and paediatric care. The unavailability of these critical tools also led to situations where patients' lives, especially those in the maternity ward, were at risk.

Having carefully evaluated the hospital's requirements in consultation with a technical team formed by the hospital, and in response to the urgent need, CA Sri Lanka donated medical oxygen supply equipment, one multi-monitor, four syringe pumps, and four BP apparatus (aneroid), worth over LKR 3.7 million.

The official handing-over ceremony took place on 15th March 2025 at the hospital premises where Mr. Heshana Kuruppu, President of CA Sri Lanka handed over the equipment to Dr. Kasun Withana, Medical Superintendent at the Deniyaya Base Hospital. Among those present at the event were Members of the Council of CA Sri Lanka, Mr. Thivanka Jayasinghe, Chairman of the Member Relations Committee, Ms. Jani Ganeshan, Chair of the CSR Sub-Committee, members of the Member Relations Committee, donors, Ms. Lakmali Priyangika, CEO of CA Sri Lanka, as well as the staff of the Institute and the hospital.

Speaking at the event, Mr. Kuruppu emphasised CA Sri Lanka's commitment to supporting the healthcare sector: ""Health is essential, and doctors play a vital role in saving lives. This donation will undoubtedly contribute to building a healthier future for generations to come.""

Dr. Withana extended the hospital's gratitude to CA Sri Lanka, emphasising how the donation will help save lives and improve patient care."
