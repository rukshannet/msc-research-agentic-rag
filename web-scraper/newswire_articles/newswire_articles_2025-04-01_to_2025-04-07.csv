https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/01/global-gold-price-touches-record-high/,2025-04-01,Global Gold price touches record high,"Gold blasted through the $3,100-an-ounce mark on Monday as concerns around US President Donald Trump's barrage of tariffs and the potential economic fallout drove a fresh wave of investments into the safe-haven asset.

Spot gold set another all-time high of $3,126.97 per ounce during the morning trading, having already hit multiple records last week in the lead-up. By 10:30 a.m. ET, it pulled back to around $3,113.57 for a 1.0% gain.

Gold futures followed a similar pattern, having gained as much as 1.4% to $3,160.70 per ounce in New York before falling to $3,146.30 per ounce.

The rally takes bullion's gains for the year to 18%, as investors continue to hedge against economic instability, geopolitical tensions and inflation in Trump's second stint in office. Earlier this month, gold breached the pivotal $3,000-per-ounce mark for the first time, a reflection of the metal's value during turbulent times.

Several major banks have already raised their price targets for the yellow metal on the back of its surging safe-haven appeal. Last week, Goldman Sachs upped its year-end forecast to $3,300 an ounce, but also cited an ""extreme scenario"" under which gold could even reach $4,500. Bank of America's target of $3,063 has already been surpassed, while the UBS target of $3,200 is in sight.

""For now, gold's appeal as a safe haven and inflation hedge has further strengthened in light of these geopolitical concerns and tariff uncertainty. We remain constructive on the outlook of gold amid ongoing global trade friction and uncertainty,"" said analysts at OCBC.

""Tariff issues will continue driving (gold) prices higher until there is some finality to the tit-for-tat campaign,"" Marex consultant Edward Meir said.

Additional factors, like robust central bank demand and exchange-traded fund inflows, will also continue supporting gold's stunning rally this year, analysts and investment banks say. (Foreign Media)"

Speaking during a televised interview, Minister Nanayakkara said that former minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has wrongly interpreted several key facts, explaining that the Supreme Court has only issued orders preventing Deshabandu Tennakoon from executing his duties as the IGP.

""The FR before the Supreme Court challenges Tennakoon's appointment on the grounds that it was unlawful. The Supreme Court in no way has said that he is not the IGP. It has only prevented him from executing his duties in that designation. This ruling has been given as he is considered the IGP. This case is solely on the grounds of unlawful appointment. This defeats Wijeyadasa's claims that Tennakoon is not the IGP,"" he said.

The Justice Minister further explained that, on the other hand, the NCM has been submitted against Deshabandu Tennakoon's misconduct.

""The FR at the Supreme Court is on Tennakoon's unlawful appointment, while the NCM is against his conduct. Therefore, this is not considered sub judice. This entire case is different. This again proves that Wijeyadasa's claim is wrong. Therefore, as the government, what we have done is correct,"" he said.

Justice Minister Harshana Nanayakkara said that the NCM is being taken forward based on legal advice.

His comments came after Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, during a recent media briefing, said the NCM has been submitted at a time when the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka has issued an order determining that Deshabandu Tennakoon does not hold the post of IGP.

""An NCM can be submitted only against someone holding the post of IGP. The Supreme Court has already issued an order determining that Deshabandu Tennakoon was not the IGP. Therefore, the Speaker accepting the NCM is unconstitutional,"" he said.

Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe further said that a Supreme Court judge would be required to be appointed to the committee investigating corruption allegations against Deshabandu Tennakoon.

""While the Supreme Court itself has determined that Deshabandu Tennakoon is not the IGP, on the other hand, an investigation will be conducted to remove him from the post. This is an act that does not have any legal backing,"" he said, adding that the move undermines both the Parliament and the judiciary.

A resolution to appoint a committee of inquiry for the removal of suspended IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon was handed over to the Speaker of Parliament, Jagath Wickramaratne, on 25 March 2025.

The resolution was signed by 115 Members of Parliament. (Newswire)"

This championship is a three-round circuit Race, drawing significant attention from motorsport enthusiasts.

A Growing Competitive Scene

It was encouraging to see a large number of SL-E March competitors participating in the event, which marks a positive development in the Sri Lankan motorsport scene. The high turnout highlighted the increasing interest and enthusiasm for the sport.

Overcoming Challenges to Host the Event

Despite facing numerous obstacles, Royal Automobile Club Asia successfully conducted the event with the far-sighted & unsurpassable leadership of It' President Rizmin Razik. One of the major challenges was the withdrawal of the organizing permit at the last moment on the 27th by the Ministry of Sports and the Royal Automobile Club Asia had no choice but to seek legal recourse, obtaining a ruling from the Court of Appeals, with legal support from Hafeel Farisz, Naveen Maharachchige instructed by Sanduni Rathanayake.

Additionally, the Minister of Sports appointed an administrative committee, which included several ineligible members. This unlawfully appointed committee attempted to influence decision-making, but Royal Automobile Club Asia remained firm in its commitment to organizing a successful event. The point is that there are a number of ineligible members in this administrative committee who had influenced the Minister and the private secretary of the minister, Mr. Darshana Varagoda.

March 30th was a remarkable day in Sri Lanka's motor racing calendar, thanks to the efforts of the Royal Automobile Club Asia (RACA). The event featured 24 races, all conducted without any incident, a testament to the club's exceptional organizational capabilities.

The public turnout was impressive, with enthusiastic crowds supporting the event throughout the day. However, it was not without opposition, as several parties attempted to sabotage the race by misleading the authorities. RACA had to secure a court order to ensure the event could proceed as planned.

Recognizing Excellence in Event Management

The flawless execution of the Katukurunda Racing Meet demonstrated RACA's high level of competency in managing such large-scale events. Those who attempted to disrupt the race should have attended to witness RACA's capabilities firsthand.

As motorsport enthusiasts, we must continue to support associations like RACA, which work tirelessly to promote and develop the sport. Having witnessed the entire event, I extend my gratitude to RACA for their outstanding organizational skills, enabling us to enjoy a world-class racing experience.

Looking Ahead: More Thrilling Events to Come

Royal Automobile Club Asia has announced plans to host two more racing events in July and September this year. I urge the public, competitors, and even those who opposed this event to support those who are working hard to manage risks while delivering top-tier entertainment.

The government should also play a more constructive role in fostering these events rather than being influenced by those attempting to undermine this incredible sport."

Speaking on the 2023-2024 renewable energy project approvals, Wickremesinghe said several proposals were given the green light to attract much-needed foreign investment into Sri Lanka's energy sector. ""We approved around USD 2 to 2.5 billion worth of projects, following proper evaluations and pricing by project-specific committees,"" he said.

He clarified the processes followed with both the Adani Group and Hayleys, highlighting that committees were appointed by the Finance Ministry and Cabinet to review each proposal before approval. ""Final prices were decided based on reports by these committees. We ensured all decisions were made through official channels,"" he added.

Commenting on environmental and infrastructure factors, Wickremesinghe pointed out that the Hayleys project underwent a government-led study on migratory birds in Mannar, while Adani had to fund their own. Land for the Hayleys project was provided through the CEB, whereas Adani had to purchase the land.

""All preliminary studies, feasibility assessments, and licensing costs were handled differently for each project depending on their specific circumstances,"" he said, noting that Adani was required to fund several of these processes independently.

Dismissing allegations that monetary influence drove these projects, Wickremesinghe stated, ""If someone claims money was taken, they must also name who gave the money. Is it being suggested that Adani paid bribes? Are we saying Adani violated laws in Sri Lanka or India?""

He also urged that such issues should not be politicized during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Sri Lanka, warning that unfounded allegations could harm diplomatic ties.

""We should focus on completing these projects and strengthening Sri Lanka-India relations in line with the joint statements issued in 2023 and 2024,"" he said.

Wickremesinghe reaffirmed that the government will continue to work with India on energy cooperation, and stressed that any decision to halt projects must be backed by valid reasons.

Wickremesinghe was referring to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake's stance that his government will not proceed with the power purchase agreement for the Mannar wind power plant unless the company agrees to the government's proposed price.

Dissanayake said that the previous government had agreed to a rate of US$ 8.26 cents per unit, while the current agreement with a different company secured a deal at US$ 4.57 cents per unit--a difference that translates to Rs. 25 per unit instead of Rs. 13.

The resolution emphasised the challenges faced by Tamil Nadu's fishermen due to ongoing arrests and seizures by the Sri Lankan Navy.

Chief Minister MK Stalin led the discussion on the House floor, insisting that the only permanent solution was the retrieval of Katchatheevu and emphasised the ongoing plight of Tamil Nadu fishermen.

He urged the Union Government to amend the agreement with Sri Lanka and called on the Prime Minister, who was scheduled to visit Sri Lanka, to discuss the issue with its leaders.

""This House unanimously urges the Union Government to take all steps to retrieve Katchatheevu and secure the release of our fishermen,"" Stalin declared.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/02/factum-special-perspective-modi-in-sri-lanka/,2025-04-02,Factum Special Perspective: Modi in Sri Lanka,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to land in Sri Lanka on Friday, April 4. Over the next two days he is expected to engage with the Sri Lankan government over several agreements and pacts, encompassing trade, health, education, energy, and of course defense.

News reports point to six agreements in total. These range from power grid connectivity to health and education cooperation. The most significant among them is a defense MOU, said to be the first that Sri Lanka and India have signed: according to Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath, the basic framework for the agreement was drafted last December. Also up for discussion is the now all but completely cancelled Adani wind power project.

Power and energy, in fact, will take as much precedence as defense during his tour. While visiting the Sri Maha Bodhiya in Anuradhapura, for instance, he will launch two projects involving the railway. The location is symbolic. Around two years ago, proposals were made to link India's and Sri Lanka's grid through a 400 kV link from Madurai to Anuradhapura. While such initiatives have long histories and, as I noted at the time in Factum, have been so controversial as to make it difficult to reach a consensus on their viability, New Delhi has always been hopeful of greater grid connectivity with its neighbor to the south. And this time, it may not return with empty hands.

The elephant in the room is obviously Adani. The company has faced too much of a blowback to ever completely regain its reputation. The current government in Sri Lanka came to power on the strength of its opposition and resistance to the wind energy project: the NPP alliance has made it clear now that it will not proceed unless the company agrees to the government's proposed price, which is about half Adani's rate. While Adani does has not given up on talks with the government, it may take Modi to convince Colombo to continue negotiations, tough as they may be.

All this is doubtless big on Modi's mind as he prepares himself for the visit, which unfolds two days after Trump's reciprocal tariffs come into effect. India has not been spared from Trump's moves, even if Modi's visit to the White House implied otherwise. Despite the friendly overtures, Delhi's ties with the US are set to take a turn. It is essentially Janus-faced: India is too important a partner for the US in the Indo-Pacific, but Trump can't stop insinuating that the world, including India, owes Washington something or the other. Elon Musk's dealings with the country are a case in point: while Starlink reached a deal two weeks ago with Jio and Bharti Airtel, the two biggest telecom companies in India, Musk has since sued the government for allegedly ""censoring"" X.

Sri Lanka is the first major destination in the neighborhood for Modi after Mauritius, which he visited last month (March 12) during its national day celebrations. There also, New Delhi signed a defense pact, in effect upgrading bilateral ties to an ""enhanced strategic partnership."" It is likely that a similar pact will be finalized, and the same rhetoric amplified, during Modi's visit here.

All things considered, this may mark a second turning point in India Sri Lanka relations, the first being the 2023 Joint Vision statement: a document praised by some commentators as a step forward and others as posing a risk to the island's security if not sovereignty. Enough and more analyses have noted the irony of a historically anti-Indian party, and formation, now advocating for greater ties between the two countries. However, this fails to acknowledge that, even while in Opposition, as early back as 2022, the NPP acknowledged that the country ""cannot have a political or economic agenda... which either ignores or forgets India."" A year and a half later, of course, the NPP was invited by Delhi on an official visit - which significantly boosted its credibility.

For India, the primary challenge now lies in responding to the shifting geopolitics of the region while accommodating domestic perceptions of Indian influence in Sri Lanka. It is noteworthy that Modi's visit to Sri Lanka coincides with a shift in US power plays in the Indo-Pacific. While Washington has doubled down on its geostrategic objectives in the region, it has reduced its soft power footprint in countries like Sri Lanka. Both India and China are aware of this. Indeed, in the aftermath of the recent earthquake in Myanmar, both Delhi and Beijing were quick to arrive on the scene: in terms of humanitarian aid, both have been able to surpass the United States.

As far as New Delhi is concerned, hence, there is bound to be a race in the diplomacy game. Yet India has suffered a backlash with many of its neighbors in the subcontinent, the most recent example being Bangladesh. Sri Lanka offers a contrast in this regard, partly because the country is engaging in economic recovery efforts and partly because Sri Lanka's relations with India have always been premised on an acknowledgement of the importance of India for Sri Lanka's growth ambitions. This is why Sri Lanka has not fundamentally wavered in its diplomatic ties to Delhi.

Yet far more so than with China, Sri Lanka's official engagements with India have been at great variance with grassroots perceptions of India. The previous government, which waxed eloquent on the benefits of physical integration with India, suffered a blowback at the presidential polls partly because of the opposition's mobilization of anti-Indian sentiment. If history is a good guide, Delhi has managed to bounce back with whatever party in power - as it seems to have with the current Sri Lankan government. The sole exception in this regard, the J. R. Jayewardene regime (1978 - 1988), is today invoked as a classic case study for how not to conduct relations with India.

This is not to say that anti-Indian sentiment, on the ground or in local politics, has died down, or for that matter simmered. It has now passed to other parties and movements. The NPP has been tame in its response to Indian interventions. One can argue that it has no choice, as the governing party. Yet all indications are that opposition parties on the left and right will seize the opportunity to deal the anti-India card. The People's Struggle Alliance (PSA), for instance, headed by the JVP's (Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, the leading party in the NPP alliance) ideological archrival the FSP (Frontline Socialist Party) has warned against integration with India , justifiably framing it as a national security and sovereignty issue. Modi's entourage, which includes not just External Affairs Minister Jaishankar but also National Security Advisor Ajith Doval and Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, has only helped in amplifying these concerns and remarks in Sri Lanka.

Of course, ultimately, the problem has to do with both sides. But how so? Just as Sri Lanka has yet to acknowledge the inevitability of India's geopolitical ambitions in the region, India has not done a proper assessment of how those ambitions are perceived in Sri Lanka. There is, even at official levels, an almost dismissive attitude towards concerns over Indian interventions, for instance worries about giving access to national biometrical identification data here - and a refusal to engage with those concerns, for instance via a perception mapping exercise. Yet without such engagement, it is hard to predict the road ahead for ties between the two countries.

It is noteworthy, though perhaps not surprising, that while Sri Lanka has in its press releases been austere and restrained about the agreements that will be signed during the visit, the Indians have given greater emphasis to the historical and civilizational bonds between the two countries. This is not to say that there is a discrepancy in terms of priorities; just that for India, Sri Lanka remains more important than ever as a partner in the pursuit of its geopolitical ambitions. Also noteworthy is the fact that the Indian External Affairs Ministry has in its press release coupled Narendra Modi's visit to Thailand (where he is scheduled to meet the Prime Minister on April 3) with his subsequent tour of Sri Lanka, incorporating both countries in India's ""commitment to its 'Neighborhood First' policy, 'Act East' policy, MAHASAGAR (Mutual and Holistic Advancement for Security and Growth Across Regions) vision, and vision of the Indo-Pacific."" For Delhi, South Asia has become as important as the wider Indian Ocean - and Sri Lanka has become a key pivot in both spheres.

It is against this backdrop that Modi's latest visit to Sri Lanka - his first since 2019 - must be seen and analyzed. Since the Indian government's announcement of the visit, there has been a slew of op-eds and commentaries in the Sri Lankan media on the benefits as well as the dangers of integration with India, from the overtly optimistic to the unremittingly critical. While some paint India as Sri Lanka's civilization partner or twin, others point to what they see as its neocolonial ambitions in the country and region. Yet both sides miss the point about Prime Minister Modi's visit: that it is as concerned with maintaining continuity, the way things are between two neighbors, as it is with setting the stage for the next stage in bilateral ties, via energy or defense cooperation.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/02/a-new-drug-makes-your-blood-toxic-to-mosquitoes/,2025-04-02,A new drug makes your blood toxic to mosquitoes,"A drug used to treat a rare inherited disease has been found to make human blood toxic to malaria-carrying mosquitoes. It could provide another tool to reduce deadly insect populations.

Mosquitoes are considered the deadliest animal on the planet -- carrying diseases that kill more than one million people a year.

Scientists have found that a drug called nitisinone, which is used to treat people with a rare inherited disease called tyrosinemia, makes human blood toxic to mosquitoes.

Although it doesn't prevent the transmission of the malaria parasite Plasmodium, nitisinone is now being considered for further field tests as a chemical control to reduce the number of insects capable of spreading the disease.

What is the mosquito-killing drug?

Nitisinone is used to treat hereditary tyrosinemia type 1, which is a disease where people have too much tyrosine in their blood.

Lab tests found that when a mosquito bites someone who's been taking nitisinone, the presence of the drug prevents the insect from being able to digest the human ""blood meal"" -- 24 hours later, the insect dies. Nitisinone is toxic to mosquitoes in a way that it isn't to humans.

Compared to ivermectin, another chemical that has been investigated as a mosquito vector control, nitisinone lasts longer in the bloodstream.

It's also versatile, as it can be vaporized and sprayed on surfaces, meaning it can act like an insecticide.

An insecticide in your blood?

While field tests are required to ensure the drug is effective in malaria-prone areas, the early findings suggest it could be promising as a cheap and effective agent to control mosquito numbers.

Importantly, it appears effective against mosquito species that have developed resistance to other control chemicals.

""It kills insecticide-resistant mosquitoes. There are a few insecticides that have been used in the field for decades [but] there are resistant [mosquito] lines in the community,"" said Alvaro Acosta-Serrano, the joint supervisor of the study, based at Notre Dame University, US.

""We tested those resistant lines with nitisinone and they are almost as equally susceptible as the susceptible lines of mosquitoes. It brings a lot of benefits, not only to mention that it performs better than ivermectin.""

Anna Last, an associate professor in infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who wasn't involved in the study, said the findings were promising, particularly given results from recent field tests of ivermectin in vulnerable communities in Africa.

""It's a very relevant piece of work, I think, and does follow on from the slightly disappointing results from the majority of field trials looking at ivermectin, which showed that it didn't perform in the way that we had anticipated and hoped, in the field,"" Last told DW. (DW)"

Citing Professor Wasantha Athukorala from the University of Peradeniya, Herath said Sri Lanka should, in the short term, request a grace period on tariffs. In the long term, he said the country must strengthen FTAs, diversify exports, and build stronger trade ties with China, India, and the Asia-Pacific region.

""Structural reforms are essential. Sri Lanka must boost production efficiency, enhance competitiveness, and create an investment-friendly environment to weather this storm,"" he said, adding: ""The key question: Can Sri Lanka turn this crisis into an opportunity? Do we have the leadership to drive necessary reforms? Now is the time for bold decisions and forward-thinking policies."" (Newswire)"

Speaking at the Samagi Jana Balawegaya party convention at Hyde Park in Colombo, Premadasa said the government ignored repeated warnings about the issue and failed to take preventive action. He said the matter was previously raised in Parliament, but government members dismissed it on procedural grounds and turned off microphones.

Premadasa said the tariff places thousands of jobs and the future of nearly 200 garment factories--initiated under the administration of late President Ranasinghe Premadasa--at risk.

He accused the government of misleading the public and failing to provide transparency on its reported diplomatic response.

The opposition leader questioned when a promised delegation was sent to the U.S. and who was included in it, calling for immediate disclosure of progress. He urged the government to send a trade representative and an expert team to Washington, D.C., for direct talks with U.S. officials. He said the opposition had suggested such action multiple times but was ignored.

Premadasa said if the government fails to act, the opposition will step in to protect the interests of industrialists and workers. He also criticized the government's broader handling of foreign relations, alleging an inability to build productive international partnerships.

He accused former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa of bankrupting the country and said the current president, elected in 2024 from the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, has ""bankrupted politics."" He claimed that broken promises and deception have led to public disillusionment.

Premadasa concluded by condemning the alleged release of over 300 containers without inspection and warned that criminal activity is going unchecked, questioning whether this represents the revival promised to the people. (Newswire)"

Earlier today, the US imposed a 44% tariff on Sri Lankan goods as part of a broader global policy by President Donald Trump to apply a 10% baseline tax on imports, with higher rates for select countries.

Fernando said the government was aware of the potential tariffs but waited for the official US policy before responding.

""If a country imports more than it exports, that will create a trade deficit. For example, Sri Lanka exports to the US around $3 billion worth of goods while we import $300 million worth of goods. Therefore we have a trade deficit that is beneficial for Sri Lanka,"" he explained.

US President Trump issued the executive order imposing a 44 percent tariff on Sri Lankan goods, citing it as a reciprocal measure to what he described as the 88 percent in taxes and trade barriers imposed by Sri Lanka on the United States.

Minister Jayantha said the calculation of the 88 percent in taxes and trade barriers must be verified.

He noted that Sri Lanka has held internal discussions and hopes negotiations will lead to a tariff reduction.

Citing the country's ongoing recovery and cooperation with the International Monetary Fund, Fernando said the government will present its case based on its current economic challenges.

Deputy Minister Jayantha also acknowledged that the tariffs could negatively affect key exports, particularly apparel and food sectors, and reduce national export revenue.

""If the United States follows a global policy on reciprocal tariffs and we do not have the opportunity to renegotiate the terms, we will have a number of other options. For instance the GSP Plus preferential tariff system .

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/03/bimstec-and-the-bay-of-bengal-century-indias-vision-for-regional-power/,2025-04-03,BIMSTEC and the Bay of Bengal century: India's vision for regional power,"The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) stands at a pivotal juncture as it convenes its 6th Summit from April 2-4, 2025, in Bangkok, Thailand. This gathering underscores the growing significance of BIMSTEC in fostering regional integration and collaboration among its seven member states: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. With a combined population exceeding 1.7 billion and a collective GDP of over $5 trillion, BIMSTEC embodies a formidable economic bloc poised to influence the evolving global order.

BIMSTEC's significance in the regional and global context

Established in 1997, BIMSTEC serves as a bridge connecting South and Southeast Asia, focusing on multifaceted cooperation across 14 priority sectors, including trade and investment, transport and communication, energy, and counter-terrorism. This broad spectrum of collaboration reflects the organization's commitment to addressing shared challenges and harnessing collective strengths. The forthcoming summit, themed ""Prosperous, Resilient, and Open BIMSTEC,"" aims to adopt the Bangkok Vision 2030--a strategic roadmap outlining long-term goals for economic cooperation, environmental sustainability, and regional security.

India, as the largest economy and a founding member of BIMSTEC, plays a pivotal role in steering the organization's agenda. The country's ""Neighbourhood First"" and ""Act East"" policies align seamlessly with BIMSTEC's objectives, emphasizing regional connectivity and integration. India's commitment is evident through its leadership in various sectors:

Furthermore, India's substantial financial contribution, covering 32% of the BIMSTEC Secretariat's expenditure in Dhaka, underscores its commitment to the organization's operational efficacy.

In an era marked by shifting geopolitical dynamics and the reconfiguration of global alliances, BIMSTEC offers a platform for its members to assert their collective influence. India's proactive engagement within BIMSTEC exemplifies a strategic move towards fostering a multipolar world order, where regional groupings play a crucial role in global governance.

The anticipated signing of the Agreement on Maritime Transport Cooperation during the summit is poised to enhance maritime connectivity across the Bay of Bengal, facilitating smoother cargo and passenger movement. This agreement not only bolsters intra-regional trade but also positions BIMSTEC as a critical player in global maritime logistics.

Moreover, the collaboration between BIMSTEC and organizations like the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reflects a commitment to addressing transnational challenges through cooperative frameworks. These partnerships amplify BIMSTEC's voice in international forums, contributing to shaping norms and policies that resonate with the collective interests of its member states.

Challenges and the path forward

Despite its potential, BIMSTEC faces challenges that could impede its progress. The organization's broad mandate across numerous sectors risks diluting focus and stretching resources thin. Streamlining priorities and ensuring effective implementation mechanisms are essential to translate commitments into tangible outcomes.

India's leadership is crucial in navigating these challenges. By leveraging its diplomatic influence and economic clout, India can drive consensus-building, enhance institutional capacities, and promote a results-oriented approach within BIMSTEC. Furthermore, fostering people-to-people connections and cultural exchanges can strengthen the foundational ties that underpin regional cooperation.

As BIMSTEC members convene in Bangkok, with India's Prime Minister Modi attending, the summit represents more than a routine diplomatic engagement; it embodies a collective aspiration for a prosperous and integrated Bay of Bengal region. India's leadership within BIMSTEC is not merely a reflection of its regional ambitions but a testament to its commitment to collaborative growth and stability. By championing initiatives that promote connectivity, security, and sustainable development, India, alongside its BIMSTEC partners, contributes significantly to shaping a new world order--one that values regional cooperation as a cornerstone of global peace and prosperity.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/03/taiwan-refutes-chinas-affirmations-of-authority/,2025-04-03,Taiwan refutes China's affirmations of authority,"The contentious issue of Taiwan's status in the international community has once again come under the spotlight, with the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) of Taiwan vehemently countering Beijing's assertions. At the heart of the dispute lies the interpretation of United Nations Resolution 2758, which the People's Republic of China (PRC) claims affirms its authority over Taiwan--a claim Taipei and much of the international community strongly refute.

During the 14th National People's Congress, Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi reiterated Beijing's long-standing stance that Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. He argued that historical documents, such as the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration, validated China's sovereignty over Taiwan following Japan's surrender in 1945. Furthermore, he insisted that UN Resolution 2758, passed in 1971, settled the matter of China's representation in the UN, including Taiwan, leaving no room for interpretations like ""two Chinas"" or ""one China, one Taiwan.""

Taiwan's MAC swiftly responded, debunking Wang's claims and emphasizing that Resolution 2758 does not address Taiwan's status, let alone designate it as part of the PRC. The MAC underscored that Taiwan is a sovereign and independent country, with a democratically elected government representing its 23.5 million citizens. The council accused Beijing of deliberately distorting the resolution to enforce its ""one China"" narrative and suppress Taiwan's international presence.

The roots of this conflict can be traced back to the post-World War II era. Following Japan's surrender in 1945, Taiwan was returned to Chinese control under the Republic of China (ROC). However, the Chinese Civil War soon erupted, culminating in the establishment of the PRC on the mainland in 1949 and the ROC retreating to Taiwan. The island then evolved into a vibrant democracy, while the mainland maintained an autocratic regime. This divergence in governance further fuelled the question of Taiwan's status.

The international community has long grappled with balancing these competing narratives. In 1971, UN Resolution 2758 recognized the PRC as the legitimate representative of China in the United Nations, effectively expelling the ROC. However, the resolution did not explicitly address Taiwan's status or grant the PRC authority over the island. Instead, it simply resolved the matter of which government represented ""China"" at the UN.

Taiwan has consistently rejected claims of PRC sovereignty, highlighting its democratic system and economic achievements as evidence of its distinct identity. The MAC, alongside Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, points out that numerous Western democracies have affirmed that Resolution 2758 pertains solely to China's representation in the UN, not to Taiwan's status. For instance, the US Department of State has repeatedly clarified that the resolution does not preclude Taiwan's participation in international organizations.

Other nations, including Australia, Canada, and members of the European Union, have echoed this stance. Resolutions from the European Parliament have called for enhanced cooperation with Taiwan and emphasized its importance as a democratic partner in the Indo-Pacific region. These affirmations challenge Beijing's attempts to redefine the ""Taiwan issue"" as an internal matter.

Over the years, Beijing has employed a mix of diplomatic, economic, and military tactics to isolate Taiwan internationally. For instance, the PRC has leveraged its economic clout to persuade nations to sever official ties with Taipei. In 2018, El Salvador and the Dominican Republic switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to Beijing under pressure, following similar moves by Panama in 2017.

Moreover, Beijing has obstructed Taiwan's participation in international organizations. The island's exclusion from the World Health Assembly (WHA) during the COVID-19 pandemic drew global criticism, with many arguing that Taiwan's expertise in handling the virus was essential. The PRC justified the exclusion by invoking Resolution 2758, further illustrating its misinterpretation of the document.

Beijing's efforts to undermine Taiwan's sovereignty extend beyond diplomacy. In recent years, PRC has intensified military activities near the Taiwan Strait, conducting frequent air and naval exercises. These actions are seen as both a demonstration of force and a means of intimidating Taipei. According to Taiwan's Ministry of National Defence, Chinese military aircraft breached Taiwan's air defence identification zone (ADIZ) over 950 times in 2022 alone.

Despite mounting pressure, Taiwan has demonstrated remarkable resilience. Its economic strength, driven by industries such as semiconductor manufacturing, has made it a critical player in global supply chains. Politically, its vibrant democracy continues to garner admiration, with international organizations ranking Taiwan highly in terms of freedom and transparency.

However, Taiwan faces significant challenges in its pursuit of greater international recognition. Beijing's hybrid warfare, which combines military intimidation, disinformation campaigns, and economic coercion, seeks to erode Taiwan's global standing. The PRC's attempts to rewrite international norms, framing Taiwan as an internal issue, aim to exclude the island from forums where its voice is crucial.

The ongoing dispute over Taiwan's status underscores the complexity of cross-strait relations and the limitations of international law in resolving such conflicts. While Beijing continues to claim historical and legal justifications for its sovereignty over Taiwan, Taipei and its allies highlight the island's democratic identity and international contributions.

Efforts to resolve these tensions require pragmatic dialogue and a commitment to maintaining peace in the region. The international community, particularly democratic nations, must uphold the principles of sovereignty and self-determination while countering Beijing's disinformation. By doing so, they can support Taiwan in its quest for meaningful participation on the global stage, ensuring that its voice is not drowned out by coercion and misrepresentation.

Taiwan's rejection of China's UN claim is not just a defence of its sovereignty but a broader assertion of its role as a responsible and democratic member of the international community. The challenges it faces are formidable, but its resolve remains unshaken. (European Times)"

Walmart Inc.-controlled online retailer Flipkart, payments firm PhonePe and lodging provider Oyo Hotels are among the companies seeking to list in the country, which was the world's second-largest market for share sales last year but has lost steam since. Most companies preparing for an initial public offering have been able to strike a balance between speedy growth and profitability, according to a report by the homegrown investment bank The Rainmaker Group.

Young companies are now in better shape than in 2021 and 2022, when several startups that sought to capture India's booming capital markets cratered after listing at high valuations, said Kashyap Chanchani, managing partner at Rainmaker. Payment provider Paytm has dropped about 63% since its IPO while beauty retailer Nykaa is down 4%.

""The financial health of the startups due to list in the next two years is materially better than the companies that listed previously,"" Chanchani, who helped Indian startups raise $1 billion in equity last year, said in an interview. ""Two-thirds of these firms are already profitable, and they are also doing a better job with transparency.

Rainmaker's clients have included Oyo and e-commerce startup Swiggy, and the firm typically receives a cut of the fundraising deals it helps to arrange. It doesn't advise companies on IPOs.

The number of share sales in India dropped by 34% in the first quarter as the stock market sputtered. The benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index had risen for nine consecutive years, but it started declining in late September amid an unexpected slowdown in economic growth and a slew of analysts downgraded their expectations for corporate earnings.

First-quarter proceeds from IPOs, block sales and share placements in India nearly halved to $7.1 billion, slipping below those of Hong Kong and Japan.

Still, Chanchani is among bankers predicting that deals in India will pick up in the coming months, when several sales are expected to hit the market. Those include LG Electronics Inc.'s Indian unit, which may raise as much as $1.7 billion, and electric-scooter maker Ather Energy Pvt., which could raise about $400 million.

A new surge in startup IPOs would provide a much-needed exit to large investors such as SoftBank Group Corp. and Prosus NV. Billionaire Masayoshi Son's SoftBank Vision Fund is a shareholder in companies such as Oyo, optician Lenskart Solutions Pvt., and used-car seller CARS24 Solutions Pvt., while Prosus is an investor in e-commerce firm Meesho and home services startup Urban Company.

Firms like SoftBank and Prosus ""have a dozen companies or so where they are sitting on massive gains, and several of these firms have begun seeking the public markets route,"" Chanchani said, cautioning though that IPOs will have to be priced carefully as retail investors will reject lofty valuations.

Companies going public will have to assuage investor concerns about a slowing economy and earnings growth. Some of India's newly listed stocks have also declined after sales restrictions expired, adding pressure to a stock market already down hundreds of billions of dollars since late last year.

India's startup economy remains among the biggest in the world after the US and China. Still, it's also one that's seen major corporate governance lapses, sinking valuations and profits turning to dust. Many young firms have been forced to cut jobs and growth plans, while others have imploded. Teacher-turned-entrepreneur Byju Raveendran's eponymous online tutoring business illustrates how a once high-flying company can run aground as investors lose faith in founders once-labeled charismatic.

""One of the key questions that investors ask us often is -- can we trust the founders?"" Chanchani said. (NDTV)"

This is President Boric's first state visit to India, although two Chilean presidents have visited India in the past.""

""Prior to this, President Boric had met our Prime Minister in Brazil on the margins of the G20 summit in November 2024 in Rio. As you might know, India and Chile share warm and friendly relations. Chile was among the first countries to recognize India's independence. Since then, bilateral relations have strengthened across a number of sectors. Our two countries have commonality of views on a wide range of issues. We cooperate extensively in multilateral fora and share similar views on expansion and reform of the United Nations Security Council.

We have complementary trade and economic relations with Chile while we supply pharmaceutical products, engineering goods, automobiles and chemicals, we import a lot of critical mineral resources from Chile, which are important ingredients for our industrial development. Chile is the largest producer of copper in the world. It also has substantial reserves of lithium and other minerals. There is interest on both sides to further strengthen this relationship.""

On the Indian community residing in Chile, he said, ""The origins of the Indian community in Chile can be traced back to 1905. Currently, it is estimated that there are about 4,000 overseas Indians, about 1850 NRIs and a little over 2,000 PIOs living in Chile.

In addition, there is a constant flow of professionals and businessmen from India working mainly in the ICT and financial services sectors.

PM Amarasuriya made these remarks while addressing the International Expert Conference on 'An Integrated and Sustainable Approach to Safeguarding the World Heritage Property of the Sacred City of Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka' which was convened at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris on 01 April.

According to the PM's office, the summit, representing the partnership between UNESCO and Sri Lanka,  brought together international experts to discuss sustainable strategies for conserving Anuradhapura, a UNESCO World Heritage site with significant cultural and historical value.

PM Amarasuriya revealed that the Sri Lankan Government plans to develop three cities, Anuradhapura, Jaffna, and Kandy, as heritage cities in Sri Lanka.

She further conveyed deep condolences of Sri Lanka to the Government and people of Myanmar and Thailand, affected by the recent powerful earthquake.

The summit was attended by the Director of UNESCO, Audrey Azoulay, Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs of Sri Lanka, Dr. Hiniduma Sunil Senevi, including a group of representatives of both the Sri Lanka and UNESCO delegations.

The full statement of PM Harini Amarasuriya at the UNESCO International Summit in France;

I consider it a special privilege to have this opportunity to visit UNESCO when Sri Lanka is celebrating the 75th anniversary of its partnership with the organization.

We celebrated last July with a productive visit to Sri Lanka by the Director-General of UNESCO, Audrey Azoulay, and it's culminating today in Paris with the convening of this expert conference on Anuradhapura, one of the most revered heritage sites and cultural treasures in the world.

This conference provides us with a unique opportunity to reflect upon aspects of Sri Lanka's long-standing collaboration with UNESCO, a partnership that has reinforced and enriched our shared vision of advancing intercultural dialogue, heritage conservation, education, sustainable development, and technological progress.

In this backdrop, where it requires ensuring the preservation of cultural heritage for future generations, UNESCO's role as a global leader is more relevant than ever. This timely initiative, gathering the world's experts on heritage conservation, provides a critical platform for dialogue, knowledge sharing, technical collaboration, and resource mobilization, thus reinforcing our collective responsibility to protect and sustain this invaluable cultural legacy for future generations.

In Sri Lanka, the ancient kingdoms of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa stand at heritage sites located in the cultural triangle, conserved with the support of UNESCO since the 1980s, which goes back to the long-standing partnership.

We also need to be very conscious that heritage, history and archeology have been weaponized in the past by resistance groups to divide our people for narrow political games. The government rejects racism and strives to acknowledge and celebrate the diversity of cultures and traditions of Sri Lanka and bring people together. (Newswire)"

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/03/trumps-44-us-tariff-how-it-will-affect-sri-lanka/,2025-04-03,Trump's 44% US Tariff:  How it will affect Sri Lanka ?,"Sri Lanka's apparel industry is facing a significant blow following the imposition of a 44% tariff on Sri Lankan goods by the United States under President Donald Trump's revised trade policy.

The move, described by the U.S. as a reciprocal measure in response to what it claims are Sri Lanka's 88% trade barriers on American goods, places Sri Lanka among the countries facing the highest tariff rates globally.

The United States has long been Sri Lanka's most important export destination, accounting for 23% of total merchandise exports in 2024. Of nearly 3 billion in exports to the U.S. last year, the vast majority--over 70%--came from the apparel sector. These include men's and women's undergarments, outerwear, T-shirts, sportswear, gloves, and baby garments.

Industry leaders and economic analysts warn that the steep tariff could have serious consequences for Sri Lanka's already fragile economy. With the new 44% levy, Sri Lankan garments risk becoming uncompetitive in the U.S. market, which could result in a sharp drop in orders. This would lead to a contraction in apparel export earnings and threaten thousands of jobs in one of Sri Lanka's most vital sectors.

Exporters fear U.S. orders could plummet in volume as Sri Lankan-made apparel becomes dramatically more expensive for American importers. A tariff of this magnitude effectively adds nearly half again to the cost of Sri Lankan goods entering the U.S. market. For price-sensitive retailers and consumers, such a jump is likely to suppress demand

The apparel industry is Sri Lanka's largest industrial export sector, employing nearly 300,000 people directly and supporting hundreds of thousands more through indirect employment. Companies like MAS Holdings, Brandix, and Hirdaramani--major players in the global garment supply chain--are likely to face pressure on profit margins. Smaller and medium-sized exporters, many of whom rely heavily on U.S. buyers, are particularly vulnerable and may be forced to reduce production or shut down altogether.

Notably, Sri Lanka is not alone in facing U.S. tariffs - other major apparel exporters like Bangladesh (37% tariff), Vietnam (46%), India (26%), and Cambodia (49%) were also hit with hefty duties

This across-the-board hike means U.S. buyers cannot entirely avoid higher costs by simply switching to another Asian supplier. However, Sri Lanka's rate is among the highest, putting it at a slight disadvantage relative to some peers (for example, Bangladesh's tariff is lower).

The Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF), the leading industry body, is expected to coordinate with the government to seek urgent relief.

Foreign Affairs Minister Vijitha Herath last month announced that a high-level Sri Lankan delegation will travel to Washington, D.C. in May for talks with U.S. trade officials, with the aim of mitigating or lifting the tariffs

""Sri Lanka simply cannot afford the burden of these additional tariffs on our exports,"" Herath told Parliament, stressing the country's fragile economic state after its recent financial crisis

Sri Lanka is currently under an IMF-supported reform program, and the minister expressed optimism that this could bolster their case for relief or a waiver from the U.S.

The government is expected to highlight the potential humanitarian impact - including job losses and reduced income for a developing nation - in its appeal to the U.S., arguing that Sri Lanka's high import tariffs (the source of Trump's ""reciprocal"" argument) are already being phased down as part of economic reforms.

The new tariff comes at a critical time for Sri Lanka, as it emerges from an economic crisis marked by inflation, debt restructuring, and a steep decline in foreign reserves. The apparel industry had shown signs of recovery, with modest growth in exports and renewed interest from international buyers. The sudden imposition of the U.S. tariff threatens to reverse those gains.

With global trade tensions rising, Sri Lanka's apparel sector now finds itself navigating a period of unprecedented uncertainty. The government's ability to negotiate exemptions or reduced tariffs, and the industry's adaptability in the face of rising trade barriers, will be crucial in determining how deeply the sector is affected in the months ahead.

This was disclosed during the COPA Committee meeting held recently (02 Apr) to discuss the special audit reports compiled regarding the scheme implemented between 01 May 2022 and 15 September 2023 to grant permits for the importation of fully electric vehicles for Sri Lankans employed abroad, based on foreign remittances.

During the meeting, the Auditor General pointed out that there are suspicions of money laundering in the issuance of these vehicle permits. He indicated that these suspicions emerged upon examining the entire procedure carried out in this regard.

The Auditor General further revealed that 1,077 vehicle permits were issued during this period, of which 77 permits were later canceled, and that two main institutions had acted as importers providing facilities for 640 permit holders. He emphasized that this indicates the creation of a business under the pretext of permit issuance.

Moreover, due to the increase of the luxury tax exemption threshold from Rs. 6 million to Rs. 12 million for 921 vehicles imported until 30 September 2024, the Auditor General stated that the government lost tax revenue amounting to Rs. 2.42 billion.

It was also revealed that four individuals who had not traveled abroad during the relevant period were issued electric vehicle permits. Since the circular relevant to this scheme did not specify a minimum duration of overseas employment required to be eligible for an electric vehicle permit, individuals who had been abroad for short periods ranging from three days to three months, as well as those who had traveled abroad intermittently, had been granted permits. It was also revealed that the Ministry of Labour and Foreign Employment had acted under this scheme before its revision.

Accordingly, the Chairman of the COPA stated that the former Secretary of the Ministry had carried out all these irregular activities at the behest of the former Minister and that this appears to have been done to provide privileges to a selected group of individuals.

Furthermore, an official who was present at the meeting stated that, as a public servant, it had been difficult to act with integrity while being involved in this scheme, which is why the official had opted for a transfer.

Accordingly, the COPA Committee recommended that an internal investigation be conducted and a report be submitted within a month, and that disciplinary action be taken against the officials involved in these irregularities. (Newswire)"

Participating in the National New Paddy Harvest Festival, the President revealed the Paddy Marketing Board is burdened with a debt of Rs. 28 billion, while harvested paddy is being left to spoil in storage.

The President emphasized that the current administration has accepted the responsibility of restoring and restructuring this disordered system, adding that the government expects the support not only of the state machinery related to agriculture but also of all farming communities.

He affirmed the intention to integrate Sri Lanka's cultural and traditional systems to reclaim the legacy of the agricultural economy and thereby strengthen the national economy.

President Dissanayake further stated that the country's ancient kings achieved greatness through their contributions to agriculture and irrigation and that self-sufficiency in food was a critical factor in that success.

He highlighted that sustainable development has become a global discourse today and that Sri Lanka's ""Tank Cascade System"" or ""Vapi System,"" stands as a remarkable example of sustainable development and the country's irrigation system, which dates back nearly 2,000 years, continues to contribute to the advancement of agriculture even today.

As such, the President said the government has allocated Rs. 2 billion in the current budget to rehabilitate the irrigation system and renovation work on the North Central Maha Ela Project has already commenced to revitalize the country's agricultural industry. He added that the government also plans to develop seed farms to produce self-sufficient seeds, while protecting genetic ownership.

He further emphasized the need for fair prices for agricultural produce, both for farmers and consumers.

The President added that due to long-standing market distortions, the government will intervene over the next two to three harvesting seasons to ensure both parties receive fair prices and that the necessary provisions for such state interventions have been made in the current budget.

Steps have been taken to create storage capacity to hold 300,000 metric tons of paddy, which is expected to mitigate market distortions going forward, he said.

President Dissanayake made the remarks while attending the National New Paddy Harvest Festival, a traditional annual ceremony of offering the first portion of the freshly harvested Maha season paddy to the sacred Sri Maha Bodhi, which was held this morning (04 Apr) under his patronage.

The 58th edition of the National New Paddy Harvest Festival was organized at the historic Sri Maha Bodhi premises in Anuradhapura by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of Agrarian Services.

The festival was marked under the theme ""In unison, let us cultivate the land, to build a self-sufficient nation"", following the guidance of the Atamasthanadhipathi, the Most Venerable Pallegama Hemarathana Nayaka Thera.

This ritual, which dates back to the era of ancient monarchs, saw the participation of farmers from across the country. In accordance with tradition, they prayed for timely rains and fertile fields and invoked blessings for a self-sufficient and prosperous economy through agriculture.

President Anura Kumara Disanayake first paid homage and received blessings from the sacred Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi before joining the ceremonial proceedings.
The sacred procession, which carried the newly harvested paddy from near the historic Sinha Kanuwa in Anuradhapura, arrived at the sandy courtyard of the Sri Maha Bodhi, marking the ceremonial commencement of the New Paddy Harvest Festival.

The Most Venerable Pallegama Hemarathana Nayaka Thera commenced the ritual by filling the golden bowl with the new paddy, after which representatives from all provinces added paddy from their respective regions, symbolically filling the golden bowl.

President Anura Kumara Disanayake also participated in this ritual, amidst the chanting of Pirith by the Maha Sangha. A vessel of pure bee honey, traditionally offered to the Sri Maha Bodhi, was ceremonially presented to the President by Deputy Leader of the Vedda Community W.U. Bandiyala Eththo.

The vessel of ghee, brought from the historic Saman Devalaya in Sabaragamuwa, was also presented to President Anura Kumara Disanayake, to be used in the customary ghee offering at the Sri Maha Bodhi.

The President also received the commemorative plaque of the 58th National New Paddy Harvest Festival and presented tokens of appreciation to farmer leaders who have made significant contributions to the development of the country's agriculture sector.

As part of the initiative to secure a pest-free harvest, the President participated in the distribution of pest-resistant seed paddy to farming communities across the provinces. (Newswire)"

Issuing a statement, Georgieva said the US Tariffs clearly represent a significant risk to the global outlook at a time of sluggish growth.

""It is important to avoid steps that could further harm the world economy. We appeal to the United States and its trading partners to work constructively to resolve trade tensions and reduce uncertainty,"" the IMF Managing Director added.

Georgieva further said the IMF will share the results of its assessment in the World Economic Outlook, which will be published at the time of the IMF/World Bank Spring Meetings later this month.

The statement comes as the Donald Trump-led US Government recently imposed reciprocal tariffs on several countries, including Sri Lanka.

A 44% tariff was imposed on Sri Lankan goods by the United States under President Donald Trump's revised trade policy.

The move, described by the U.S. as a reciprocal measure in response to what it claims are Sri Lanka's 88% trade barriers on American goods, places Sri Lanka among the countries facing the highest tariff rates globally.

The United States has long been Sri Lanka's most important export destination, accounting for 23% of total merchandise exports in 2024. Of nearly 3 billion in exports to the U.S. last year, the vast majority--over 70%--came from the apparel sector. (Newswire)"

Yoon was not present in court to hear the verdict.

In a nationally televised unanimous verdict, the court's acting chief Moon Hyung-bae said the eight-member bench upheld Yoon's impeachment, finding that Yoon's martial law declaration ""violated"" the constitution, did not not follow correct procedures and interfered with the independence of the judiciary.

The verdict also said Yoon violated his duty as commander-in-chief by mobilizing troops.

Yoon's People Power Party said it accepted the court's verdict.

""We extend our sincere apology to the people,"" lawmaker Kwon Young-se said.

Jubilation and anger after verdict

Yoon supporters as well as pro-impeachment demonstrators camped outside the court overnight.

Ahead of the verdict, police raised the alert to the highest possible level, enabling the deployment of the entire force.

As the verdict was announced, thousands of supporters of his ouster erupted in cheers, with chants of ""We won!"" ringing out.

Meanwhile, Yoon's supporters, gathered near his official residence, reacted with anger and dismay. According to Yonhap News Agency, one protester was arrested for breaking a police bus window.

Yoon Kap-keun, one of Yoon's lawyers, labelled the ruling a ""pure political decision.""

Why was the president arrested?

Yoon was arrested and charged by prosecutors in January over his December 3 decision to declare martial law and sending troops to parliament to prevent its repeal, a move that plunged the country into political turmoil.

South Korea's opposition-led parliament subsequently voted to impeach Yoon in mid-December, leading to his suspension from office.

Following his impeachment, the 64-year-old resisted arrest for two weeks at his presidential compound in central Seoul.

Yoon has since defended the short-lived imposition of martial law as a ""proclamation that the nation was facing an existential crisis.""

In March, Seoul's Central District Court canceled Yoon's arrest warrant, citing the timing of his indictment and ""questions about the legality"" of the investigation and freed him from prison.

What happens next?

Prime Minister Han Duck-soo will continue to serve as acting president until the new president is inaugurated.

South Korea must now elect a new president within the next 60 days.

Meanwhile, Yoon is also facing a parallel criminal trial over insurrection charges related to the martial law declaration.

He is the first sitting South Korean president to stand trial in a criminal case. The case is expected to drag on well past his impeachment. (DW)"

Speaking at a media briefing held in Colombo, Deputy Inspector General of Police Indika Hapugoda, who heads the Traffic Division, said that 565 fatal road accidents were reported between January and March this year, resulting in 592 deaths.

He noted that during the upcoming Sinhala and Tamil New Year season, steps must be taken to minimise road accidents and urged the public to be cautious.

On average, 7 to 8 people die daily in road accidents across the country, DIG Hapugoda pointed out.

Highlighting the tragic reality, DIG Hapugoda stated that on average, 7 to 8 people who leave home for various daily needs never return due to fatal road accidents.

The majority of these are motorcycles, accounting for approximately 4.92 million, while three-wheelers make up the second-largest category with around 1.185 million registrations.

Together, motorcycles and three-wheelers represent 72% of the total registered vehicles in the country, which has led to them being involved in the highest number of road accidents, DIG Hapugoda said.

He revealed this during a short interview with The Life Traveller YouTube channel, responding to a question regarding the public's concern over the delay in reducing medicine prices.

When asked why the government continues to delay in providing relief to the public through reduced medicine prices, the Minister acknowledged the concern and explained that a legal barrier was the main reason.

According to the Minister, pharmaceutical companies had filed a petition challenging the NMRA's price control mechanism, following which the court issued an injunction halting the operations of the price control committee.

However, he noted that steps have now been taken to resolve the issue, which has remained unresolved for about a year and a half.

He added that based on a decision taken nearly two months ago, a new pricing mechanism has now been finalized. Therefore, the arguments made by the pharmaceutical companies are no longer valid, he said.

The government is now preparing to file a motion in court requesting the removal of the existing injunction, presenting the newly developed framework. (NewsWire)"

Your Excellency President Dissanayake ji,

Delegates from both countries,

Friends from the media,

Namaskar!

Ayubowan!

Vanakkam!

It is a matter of great pride for me to be awarded the 'Sri Lanka Mitra Vibhushana' by President Dissanayake today. This award does not only honour me, but also honours 140 crore Indians. It is a tribute to the historic ties and deep friendship between the people of India and Sri Lanka.

I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the President, the Sri Lankan Government and to the people of Sri Lanka, for this honour.

Friends,

As Prime Minister, this is my fourth visit to Sri Lanka. My last visit in 2019 came at a very sensitive time. It was my firm belief at the time that Sri Lanka will rise, and rise stronger.

I applaud the courage and patience of the Sri Lankan people, and today, I am happy to see Sri Lanka back on the path of progress. India is proud to have fulfilled its duties as a true friendly neighbour. Whether it was the terrorist attack of 2019, the COVID pandemic, or the recent economic crisis, we have stood firmly with the people of Sri Lanka during every difficulty.

I am reminded of the words of the great Tamil saint Thiruvalluvar. He said:

Seyar Kariya Yaavul
Natt Pinn
Aadu Pul
Vinnaikkariya Yaavul Kaapu

Which means, in the face of challenges and enemies, there is no stronger assurance than a true friend and the shield of his friendship.

Friends,

President Dissanayake chose India for his first foreign visit after becoming President, and I have had the privilege of becoming his first foreign guest. This is a symbol of the depth of our special relations.

Sri Lanka has a special place in both our Neighbourhood First Policy and Vision 'MAHASAGAR'. In the last four months, since President Dissanayake's visit to India, we have made significant progress in our cooperation.

The Sampur Solar Power Plant will help Sri Lanka achieve energy security. The agreement reached to build a multi-product pipeline, and to develop Trincomalee as an energy hub will benefit all Sri Lankans. The Grid Inter-Connectivity Agreement between the two countries will create opportunities for Sri Lanka to export electricity.

I am pleased that today a 5,000 Solar Rooftop System will be inaugurated for religious places in Sri Lanka. India will also provide support for the Sri Lanka Unique Digital Identity project.

Friends,

India has adopted the vision of 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas'. We also value the priorities of our partner countries.

In the last 6 months alone, we have converted loans worth more than USD 100 million into grants. Our bilateral 'Debt Restructuring Agreement' will provide immediate assistance and relief to the people of Sri Lanka. Today we have also decided to reduce interest rates. It symbolises that even today, India stands with the people of Sri Lanka.

For the social and economic development of the Eastern Provinces, a support package of approximately 2.4 billion Lankan Rupees will be provided. Today we also inaugurated Sri Lanka's largest warehouse for the welfare of farmers.

Tomorrow we will inaugurate the 'Maho-Omanthai' railway line, and lay the foundation stone for the signalling system on the 'Maho-Anuradhapura' section. Work for the modernisation of the Kankesanthurai Port will begin soon.

For the Indian Origin Tamil Community in Sri Lanka, the construction work of 10,000 houses will be completed soon. Training will be provided to an additional 700 Sri Lankan personnel. They will include Members of Parliament, personnel associated with the judiciary, entrepreneurs, media persons, as well as young leaders.

Friends,

We believe that we have shared security interests. The security of both countries is interconnected and co-dependent.

I am grateful to President Disanayaka for his sensitivity towards India's interests. We welcome the important agreements made in the area of Defence Cooperation. We have also agreed to work together on the Colombo Security Conclave and Security Cooperation in the Indian Ocean.

Friends,

There is centuries old spiritual ties between India and Sri Lanka.

I am extremely happy to announce that the Holy Relics of Lord Buddha found in 1960, in the Aravali region of my home state - Gujarat, are being sent to Sri Lanka for an exposition.

India will assist in the renovation of the Thirukoneswaram Temple in Trincomalee. India will also provide support in the construction of the sacred city in the Anuradhapura Mahabodhi temple complex, and the Sita Eliya temple in Nuwara Eliya.

Friends,

We also discussed issues related to fishermen's livelihood. We agreed that we should proceed with a humane approach in this matter. We also emphasised on immediate release of the fishermen and their boats.

We also talked about reconstruction and reconciliation in Sri Lanka. President Disanayaka appraised me of his inclusive approach. We hope that the Sri Lankan Government will meet the aspirations of the Tamil people and fulfil its commitment towards fully implementing the Constitution of Sri Lanka, and conducting Provincial Council Elections.

Friends,

Relations between India and Sri Lanka are based on mutual trust and goodwill. We will continue to work together to fulfill the hopes and aspirations of our people.

Once again, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to President Disanayaka for his warm welcome. I am confident that in the times to come we will take our partnership to new heights.

Thank you very much!
Nandri!
Bohoma Sthuthi!

During a recent discussion, chaired by the Secretary to the President, Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, officials from all relevant ministries and institutions agreed to promptly implement these proposals.

It was also informed that the ongoing study by the University of Peradeniya to identify long-term solutions for the issues arising from the Nilwala Salinity Barrier will be reassessed and reviewed.

The sand piled along the riverbanks, which was deposited during the construction of the salinity barrier, will be removed to ensure smooth water flow during floods. The height of the sheet pile barriers on both sides of the salinity barrier will be reduced to facilitate water drainage.

Accumulated sand in the riverbed will be cleared, while alternative canal pathways will be cleaned and obstructions removed to improve water flow.

Additionally, water pumping stations used to drain excess water from paddy fields will be properly maintained.

To address the drainage issues affecting the homes, lands and access roads of residents of Circle Road, Hittatiya centre, Matara during heavy rains, a few short-term solutions have been proposed while awaiting a permanent resolution.

A new drainage system will be developed along Dahanayake Road to divert water from Hittatiya First Milepost to Nupe Ela, replacing the current connection to the canal system along Circle Road. The existing drainage system will be upgraded to increase its capacity.

The drainage capacity along Circle Road will be improved, and telecommunication cables currently obstructing water flow in the drainage system will be relocated to a more suitable location. The drainage system from the central section of Circle Road through Handayawatta and along Padiliyawatta Road to Nupe Ela will be expanded, with blockages removed to enhance water flow.

Upon obtaining the final land survey map from the local authorities, a decision will be made regarding the existence of a natural canal in the affected area. (Newswire)

According to Trump's Truth Social post, the extension was intended to ""ensure all necessary approvals are signed.""

""My administration has been working hard on a deal to save TikTok, and we have made tremendous progress,"" he wrote.

Trump said his administration was in contact with four different groups about a prospective deal, without naming any of them, adding he'd like to work with both China and TikTok to get the deal done.

""We don't want TikTok to go dark,"" he added.

Ban first pushed by Trump but signed by Biden

The US Congress had initially mandated that the short-video platform find a new, non-Chinese owner by January 19 for national security reasons, with Trump later extending the deadline until April 5.

Trump had tried to ban the social media network during his first term as president, but a US federal judge ruled the president did not have the authority to ban the app. Following that judicial rebuke, Congress passed the bill calling for TikTok's sale, which former PresidentJoe Biden signed.

Lawmakers in the US feared that China could gain access to TikTok's personal data for the purpose of influencing political opinion in the country.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry has said the country's government has never asked companies to ""collect or provide data, information or intelligence"" held in foreign countries. TikTok itself has said it prioritizes user safety.

Chinese company Bytedance, which owns the social media network, has repeatedly said the platform is not for sale, adding Friday that ""key matters"" remain in talks with the US government over a potential solution to keep the platform running.

Several US businesses are reported to have made offers to buy a share of TikTok.

He remarked on the enduring sportsmanship displayed by India, emphasizing how it triumphed over adversity, including the 1996 bomb blasts that shook Sri Lanka.

Shri Sanath Jayasuriya, who is currently the coach of Sri Lankan Men's cricket team, thanked the Prime Minister for India's unwavering support to Sri Lanka during their recent financial crisis. He further requested the Prime Minister if India could explore the feasibility to help establish a cricket ground to host international cricket matches in Jaffna, Sri Lanka which would help the aspiring cricketers and people of the north-eastern region of Sri Lanka.

The Prime Minister expressed his appreciation for the remarks made by Shri Jayasuriya and emphasized, ""India is committed to the 'Neighbourhood First' policy"". He highlighted India's swift response to crises in neighboring countries, citing the recent earthquake in Myanmar where India acted as the first responder.

Issuing a statement, Amnesty International South Asia said Rusdi has been detained for ninety days under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).

Amnesty International South Asia has expressed disappointment in the use of the PTA by authorities under Sri Lanka's new leadership.

Amnesty International South Asia points out that two weeks since the arrest, Sri Lankan authorities have been unable to furnish any evidence of criminal wrongdoing legitimising Rusdi's arrest or continued detention.

As such, the rights group urged the Sri Lankan authorities to immediately restore Rusdi's due process rights, and, in the absence of any credible charges or credible evidence of an internationally recognisable crime being committed, release him.

The full statement by the Amnesty International South Asia Regional Office;

Sri Lanka: @amnesty is concerned by the arrest of 22-year-old Mohamad Rusdi on 22 March 2025 in Colombo. Amnesty International has seen a copy of the Detention Order signed off by the Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake on 25 March in his capacity as the Minister of Defense ordering the detention of Rusdi for a period of ninety days, issued under the powers vested in him through the notorious anti-terror law, the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). We are disappointed to see the PTA in regular use by authorities under Sri Lanka's new leadership, despite the government's pledges that it would repeal this draconian law.

According to the Detention Order, Rusdi is detained under the suspicion that he is connected with or concerned in unlawful activity with regards to ""associating with members of extremist or terrorist organizations, motivated by extremist ideologies and acting in a manner detrimental to peace and harmony among communities and knowingly concealing such information from security forces."" Two weeks since the arrest, Sri Lankan authorities have been unable to furnish any evidence of criminal wrongdoing legitimising his arrest or continued detention.

The Sri Lankan authorities must immediately restore Rusdi's due process rights, including ensuring that he has unfettered access to his family and lawyers, and, in the absence of any charges of credible evidence of an internationally recognisable crime being committed, release him.

Furthermore, in order to breakaway from the authorities' past practices of abusing the PTA for decades, the new Sri Lankan government must be resolute in its stance on the PTA and issue strict guidelines to authorities to desist from resorting to and abusing the PTA's vast powers where there is no legitimate suspicion of a terror offence. There must be an immediate moratorium on the use of the PTA and the government should make public a timeline for its plans to do away with this abusive law. Those affected by the PTA must be provided remedies and reparations for the injustice they have suffered. (Newswire)"

Police claimed the arrest was linked to alleged extremist views, and a three-month detention order had been issued by the President under the PTA.

His detention triggered strong public backlash and protests. Last week, demonstrators gathered near the Police Headquarters in Slave Island demanding his release. Thousands of stickers in support of Palestine were distributed during the protest, with participants voicing concern over the suppression of free expression and the use of counter-terror laws against peaceful activism.

Amnesty International South Asia had also raised concerns about Rusdi's arrest and detention, stating that Sri Lankan authorities had failed to present any evidence of criminal wrongdoing to justify holding him under the PTA. The group also criticised the continued use of the PTA under the country's new leadership. (NewsWire)"

Karachi is the largest benefactor of lower tariffs on exports to the EU under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), a 1971 initiative intended to boost the economies of developing nations. A similar UK scheme, the Developing Countries Trading Scheme, allows it to export £250 million a year in bedlinen and £100 million in jeans to the UK for a 12% reduction in import duty.

But Pakistan's continued policy of discrimination against non-Muslims and their teachings - breaking religious freedom clauses in its own constitution- is increasingly problematic. In a sign that Donald Trump isn't the only one capable of weaponising tariffs, former EU Education Commissioner Ján Figeľ told a UN Human Rights Council group that Pakistan's continued flouting of equality rules means that that the EU should ""halt"" the preferential tariffs.

""Freedom of religion or belief is not just one right among many--it is central to human dignity and a litmus test for the protection of all other rights,"" he told a UN Human Rights Council group in Geneva.

""Pakistan's constitutional and penal structures--particularly the blasphemy laws--are uniquely harsh and foster widespread discrimination.""

He added; ""Pakistan is the largest beneficiary of GSP+ preferences, yet there has been little improvement in human rights.

'The EU must reassess the cost of this silence.""

Mr Figeľ also called for the reform of EU education support, stating: ""Financial assistance to discriminatory or extremist educational content must be halted. Promoting segregation from childhood undermines peace, justice, and inclusion.""

His call was backed by Willy Fautré, director of Human Rights Without Frontiers, said: ""Between 2016 and 2024, the European Union has spent upwards of €150 million on education in Pakistan.

""Yet this investment supports a system where non-Muslim children face exclusion, and extremist clerics dictate curricula.

""Parliamentary questions have been raised, but the Commission's responses have lacked transparency and accountability.""

Examples include a professor in the Punjab who was forced to publicly renounce teaching Darwin's theory after threats from clerics.

""This is not education, it is ideological coercion - the EU's credibility is at stake,"" he added.

""If Europe is to remain a human rights actor, it must ensure that public funds do not enable the erosion of pluralism and academic freedom.""

Inna Chefranova, executive director of the European Facilitation Platform, said other issues extended to child marriages and forced religious conversions.

""The problem of forced religious conversion is systemic, not incidental. It is enabled by a curriculum that marginalises non-Muslim identities and presents Islamic supremacy as a norm,"" she said.

""Cases such as that of 13-year-old Arzoo Raja, who was abducted, converted and married to an older man, illustrate the failures of Pakistan's judiciary and education system.""

She added; ""The EU cannot continue to provide GSP+ privileges while systemic abuse persists. Monitoring without enforcement fails victims.

""Education should be a tool of inclusion, not indoctrination. Until reforms are implemented, support should be conditional on measurable progress."" (Express UK)"

The consignment, comprising rice, cooking oil, noodles and biscuits, was transported aboard the Indian Navy's landing ship tank INS Gharial and handed over at Thilawa Port by Ambassador Abhay Thakur to Yangon Chief Minister U Soe Thein and his team.

The official page for the Indian Embassy in Myanmar posted on X (formerly Twitter): ""Meeting needs of affected people. A large 442 T consignment of food aid (rice, cooking oil, noodles & biscuits) carried by the Indian Navy landing ship tank INS Gharial arrived today at Thilawa Port & was handed over by Ambassador Abhay Thakur to CM Yangon U Soe Thein & team.""

The aid is part of Operation Brahma -- India's comprehensive relief mission launched after the 7.7-magnitude earthquake on March 28, which left thousands dead and widespread damage across Myanmar. The country continues to grapple with the aftermath, and India, acting swiftly as the first responder, has taken a lead role in supporting rescue, relief, and recovery efforts.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had met Myanmar's Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on the sidelines of the BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok, Thailand, on Friday. During the meeting, PM Modi expressed India's continued support and readiness to provide further material assistance if needed. He also emphasised the need for early restoration of democracy through credible elections, according to Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri.

As part of Operation Brahma, India has so far delivered a total of 625 metric tonnes of humanitarian relief materials, including the latest consignment. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), with 80 personnel and four specially trained canines, has been deployed on the ground, equipped for rescue operations. Additionally, the Indian Army has set up a field hospital to provide essential medical care to the injured and displaced. (ANI)"

She is visiting Portugal at the invitation of President of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. The visit is taking place after a gap of 27 years, as the last State Visit took place in 1998 when President K R Narayanan visited Portugal.

While from 9-10 April, President Droupadi Murmu will visit the Slovakia at the invitation of the Slovakia President Peter Pellegrini. It will be the first visit by the President of India to Slovakia in 29 years.

Shatring the post on X, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson wrote, ""President Droupadi Murmu @rashtrapatibhvn emplanes on State visits to Portugal and the Slovak Republic. These are the first State visits to either country by the President of India in more than 25 years.""

""The visits will further expand India's multifaceted engagement with two important EU partners,"" the post added.

Speaking to media during the special briefing, Tanmay Lal Secretary (West) MEA, called the visits ""two important landmark visits.""

Sharing the details of the visit to Portugal, Secretary Lal said that the visit becomes historic as it comes when India and Portugal are marking 50 years of the diplomatic relations and this visit will ""take forward the friendship and partnership.""

""It is also 27 years since the last visit by a President from India to Portugal. So it's a very symbolic and landmark visit. The President will be traveling to Portugal at the invitation of President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa of Portugal"", he said.

Secretary Lal highlighted that the last few years show the high level exchange of visits between India and Portugal and that shows the degree of high-level engagement that is ongoing between the two countries.

Noting the events in which President Murmu will engage in Portugal, he highlighted that she will hold delegation-level talks with her counterpart, President Sousa.

""The President (Sousa) will also host a banquet dinner in her honour. The President will meet Prime Minister Luis Montenegro. She will also meet the Speaker of the Parliament of Portugal, Jose Pedro Aguiar Branco. The Mayor of Lisbon will also host a special event in her honour. President will also meet members of the Indian community in Portugal and she is likely to meet some Indian researchers from various universities and academic institutions"", he said.

He highlighted that the visit comes 30 years after the establishment of the Indian embassy in Bratislava, which was done in 1995. (ANI)"
https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/07/scapegoats-in-scrubs-doctors-in-a-broken-system/,2025-04-07,Scapegoats in scrubs: doctors in a broken system,"""Patients often come to me frustrated about unavailable beds, high costs of tests and medications, billing disputes, cleaning issues, and malfunctioning air conditioning. Many assume I have control over these matters, but in reality, these are hospital-level decisions,"" says nephrologist Dr. Najia Hameed.

In a society like Pakistan's, doctors hold a revered place and are seen as prestigious figures, often regarded as miracle workers. However, when things go wrong -- whether due to excessive fees, lack of available beds, poor services, or administrative negligence -- this respect quickly turns to resentment. Many times, doctors become the target of public frustration, even though the root causes often lie in systemic issues within hospital administration rather than the actions of individual medical practitioners.

In Pakistan, the public perception of doctors is shaped by a culture of both admiration and blame. This duality often creates confusion about the doctor's role and responsibilities. In many communities, especially among the lower-middle and middle classes, people believe that doctors oversee and manage not only patient care but also hospital staffing and maintenance.

Low levels of healthcare literacy further amplify the misunderstanding. According to the research Assessment of Health Literacy in the Adult Population of Karachi, only 3.5% of the population possesses adequate healthcare literacy, while 82.6% have limited healthcare literacy. Additionally, a survey conducted by the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) found that over 65% of patients did not understand the difference between clinical responsibilities and administrative duties. When a hospital fails to meet expectations, patients often direct their frustration toward the doctor -- who is their immediate point of contact -- making them the easiest target for blame.

Misplaced blame

""Doctors are expected to answer for everything, even changing the sheets, which is actually the staff's responsibility. Yet, we end up having to address it as well,"" says a house officer at a government hospital. ""Patients shout at us, accusing us of giving them beds with infected sheets, and when we ask the staff to change them, we're told that the sheets are out of stock,"" the house officer adds.

""If there's an issue with hygiene or a shortage of bed sheets, we're always the ones who are blamed, and patients or their families end up taking us to court,"" says Dua Azhar.

Maintaining hygiene and cleanliness in hospitals falls under the administration's responsibilities. However, the staff often taunts doctors in a light-hearted manner, saying, ""You don't even keep the hospital clean."" Azhar shares, ""We've gotten used to these light-hearted taunts, and they don't bother us anymore.""

The administration is also responsible for ensuring that lab tests are available in the hospital's laboratory. ""There are many tests that are unavailable in the hospital's lab but are critical for patient treatment. When we ask patients to go to an outside lab, they get frustrated with the doctor,"" says Azhar.

When it comes to the shortage of beds, especially in government hospitals, it's an ongoing issue. ""In emergencies, this challenge comes up daily. We are doctors, and our primary responsibility is to take care of patients, diagnose, and treat them. However, we are expected to manage everything, from arranging beds to changing their sheets. And somehow, we end up doing it,"" sighs Azhar.

""Attendants often misbehave and use foul language, but it has become internalised. We've gotten used to it,"" says Azhar.

""One thing I've observed is the lack of unity among the staff. They don't even provide us with proper equipment and medications. Whenever we ask for something at night, they always tell us, 'Come back in the morning,' or that there's a shortage of supplies.""

Suffering inefficiencies

""Around six or seven years ago, I was admitted to a private hospital after getting burned. I was shouting in pain, but no one was there to help. The doctor on duty kept saying another doctor would come and examine me,"" sighs Ansaar Mahar, a student at Hamdard University. ""When I went for follow-up bandages, the staff handled my injury so roughly. They were always in a rush, saying they had to look after other patients as well,"" Mahar adds.

It is the responsibility of the hospital's administration to set and regulate fees. ""I was in a private hospital in Sukkur with my teammate. We were there for a performance when suddenly my teammate developed a high fever. We took her to the hospital, and the first aid was fine, but they charged us excessive fees,"" says Mahar. ""On top of that, they prescribed medicines that were only available at their own pharmacy, insisting we buy them from there, even though they were really expensive.""

This situation is not isolated. Many people complain about overpriced medicines and often mention that a particular medicine is unavailable at local pharmacies, yet it mysteriously appears in the hospital's own pharmacy. This occurs because most people don't know the alternatives to specific medications. If people were more educated about their options, they wouldn't have to suffer or pay extra for medicines.

Unfortunately, the administrative sector in many Pakistani hospitals is plagued by inefficiency, corruption, and lack of accountability. Patients often mistakenly associate high medical costs with the doctors themselves. However, in the private sector, billing structures are determined by administrative policies, not by the doctors who provide care. Despite this, it is the doctor who bears the brunt of the anger when a patient is charged an unaffordable sum.

A system in crisis

Public hospitals in Pakistan are plagued by a chronic shortage of beds due to underfunding and overcrowding. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends a doctor-to-bed ratio of 1:1, but many hospitals in Pakistan fail to meet this standard. When patients are unable to secure a bed, it's often the doctor who bears the brunt of the blame, even though the real issue lies with hospital management and resource allocation.

""We face this all the time -- dealing with a shortage of beds and facing misbehavior from patients and attendees because of it,"" says Dr. Mohsin Shah, a resident in orthopedic surgery. He recalls an incident that occurred due to a lack of available beds: ""Once we ran out of beds and asked patients to wait for a while. They lost their temper and even verbally and physically abused the doctor.""

Staff and facility issues are also prevalent. ""Even the staff shows us attitude,"" complained a house officer. In public hospitals, staff is often poorly trained, and due to mismanagement and a shortage of personnel, they become overburdened and frustrated. Incidents of misbehavior by hospital staff or the unavailability of critical facilities like labs or diagnostic centers are clear administrative failures. ""Yet, doctors are seen as representatives of the system and become victims of attendees' frustration,"" adds Azhar.

High treatment costs and skyrocketing bills are among the core issues faced by patients. However, instead of addressing these concerns with hospital administration, patients often direct their frustration toward doctors.

""Patients and their families sometimes assume that I decide the charges, and I can see their frustration,"" says Dr. Hameed. ""They start begging, and I try to explain, as gently as possible, that the fees are set by the hospital, not by the doctors. If needed, I direct them to the billing department so they can get proper assistance.""

Another tactic employed by some hospital administrations is gaslighting patients. When complaints arise, administrators may downplay the legitimacy of patient concerns or suggest that the issue was a result of the patient's misunderstanding. This redirection of blame confuses patients and reinforces the misconception that doctors are at fault.

In some cases, patients are told that doctors are ""busy"" or ""not performing well"" to cover up administrative shortcomings, such as scheduling errors or a lack of staff. This not only deflects attention from the real problems but also damages the trust between doctors and patients, leading to a breakdown in communication and the quality of care.

Clarifying responsibilities

To clear up the confusion, it is essential to highlight the responsibilities and roles of hospital administration. Hospital administrators are responsible for the logistical, financial, and operational functions of healthcare facilities. This includes setting and regulating fees (in private sectors), hiring and managing staff, maintaining hospital infrastructure, allocating resources such as beds and medical equipment, and implementing patient care policies.

One of the more insidious outcomes of administrative failures is the exploitation of doctors. Many young physicians work under grueling conditions with limited resources. A report by the Young Doctors Association (YDA) found that 80% of junior doctors in public hospitals work shifts exceeding 12 hours, often without adequate support staff or functioning equipment. When issues arise, hospital management often deflects blame onto doctors to avoid scrutiny.

For example, in cases of delayed surgeries or misdiagnoses caused by faulty equipment, it is easier for administrators to accuse a doctor of negligence than to address the underlying systemic failures. This not only demoralises doctors but also creates an environment where they are constantly on the defensive.

The path forward

To address these issues, a multi-pronged approach is necessary. Educating the public about the distinct roles of doctors and hospital administrators is key to mitigating misplaced blame. Health literacy programs should be introduced in schools and communities to explain how hospitals operate and clarify the responsibilities of various healthcare workers.

It is also crucial to implement stricter oversight and accountability mechanisms for hospital administrations. This includes transparent billing, proper allocation of resources, and regular audits to curb corruption and inefficiencies. Strengthening these mechanisms will ensure that administrative failures are identified and addressed promptly, rather than being deflected onto doctors.

Ensuring that doctors have the necessary resources, support staff, and infrastructure to perform their duties is vital. This can help prevent situations where doctors are unfairly blamed for systemic shortcomings. Additionally, protecting doctors from administrative scapegoating through legal and professional safeguards is essential to preserve their ability to provide quality care without fear of unjust reprisal.

Establishing independent patient advocacy groups is another important step. These groups can assist patients in navigating the healthcare system and lodging complaints appropriately. They can also hold hospital administrations accountable for systemic failures, ensuring that patient concerns are addressed properly.

The healthcare crisis in Pakistan is complex, and while doctors are often the face of the system, they are not always the source of its failures. Mismanagement, corruption, and inefficiency within hospital administrations contribute significantly to patient dissatisfaction. By shifting the focus from blaming doctors to holding administrations accountable, we can pave the way for a more equitable and effective healthcare system. Only through awareness, education, and systemic reform can we ensure that patients receive the care they deserve and doctors receive the respect they have earned. It's time to recognise who is really responsible and demand accountability where it truly belongs.

The upgraded railway track from Maho to Omanthai, spanning 128 kilometers, will allow for faster travel times, increased load capacity and improved safety.

In conversation with ANI, Hari Mohan Gupta, Chairperson and Managing Director of Ircon International Limited, said that India's assistance is of great significance to the debt-ridden nation.

""We have brought the modern track structure that we provide in Indian Railways and now after its construction, the maximum speed will be done at a speed of 120km per hour and the booked speed will be done at a speed of 100km per hour and the load carrying capacity will be up to 20 tonnes, so this will result in tremendous uplift in the economy of Sri Lanka,"" said Hari Mohan Gupta.

These improvements are expected to have a positive impact on tourism, a significant sector in Sri Lanka's economy. The upgraded railway line will also benefit the local public, enhancing their overall well-being

""There will be a lot of boom because of the travel time, which will be reduced by about three hours from the northern part of Sri Lanka to the adjacent parts of Sri Lanka, so tourism will get a big boost. Sri Lanka is known for its tourism and lives in the hearts of our Indians. Sri Lanka is very mythologically very pleasant memories. So, this will benefit the Sri Lankan public a lot, so their general well-being will be very good,"" he said.

The project was executed by Ircon International Limited, an Indian public sector undertaking, with funding from the Ministry of External Affairs. The upgrade was completed in two phases between January 2023 and September 2024.

""This is a 128km long project. We executed the process from Maho to Omanthai in two parts. Anuradhapuram to Omanthai, which is a 63km-long project, we started its track upgradation work in January 2023, and we finished it in July 2023. After that, we caught the portion from Maho to Anuradhapuram, which is 65 km long. We started its work in January 2024,"" he said.

""And when we finished it in September 2024, this line of credit, which was funded by the Government of India's Ministry of External Affairs, was done. The old track structure was in very miserable condition because it was very old, which also had many rails,"" he said.

Gupta added that after the initial construction, the rails got corroded and used to make loud sounds. The new rails built with Indian assistance will help the Sri Lankan economy.

""When it got old, it was corroded, and it had fish-plated joints, so there used to be a loud sound. The speed maximum could go 60-65 and its load carrying capacity could be up to a maximum of 17 tons. So by upgrading this, we installed concrete sleepers and rail 60 kg of flash butt welded joints and provided switch expansion joints,"" he said.

""Ircon has been here since 2009. You will be happy to know and the track which was the Northern Portion of was in Sri Lanka,"" he added.

He added that PM Modi and Dissanayake's launch will benefit the people of Sri Lanka.

""We got this 128 km of work later, which we have now completed, and today it is a matter of great pleasure that today the Honorable Prime Minister of India and the Honorable President of Sri Lanka have agreed this project to our Sri Lankan Government to the country of Sri Lanka. They are offering, and the purpose of both is to make life better for the public here and make them happier,"" he said.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/07/england-appoint-new-white-ball-skipper/,2025-04-07,England appoint new white-ball skipper,"England announced that Harry Brook will take over as the new men's white-ball skipper on Monday, April 7.

The 26-year-old has been appointed as Jos Buttler's successor in the white-ball format after the latter resigned from his role following England's winless Champions Trophy 2025 campaign.

Brook, who has been part of the white-ball setup since 2022, has been pivotal to England's batting lineup across formats.

Currently ranked number two in the ICC Men's Test Batting Rankings, Brook has spent the past year as vice-captain in both ODI and T20I formats.

He made his captaincy debut against Australia last September in Buttler's absence, earning praise for his tactical awareness and calm leadership. Brook was also the captain of England U19s in the Men's U19 World Cup 2018.

""It's a real honour to be named England's white-ball captain,"" Brook was quoted by ECB.

""Ever since I was a kid playing cricket at Burley in Wharfedale, I dreamed of representing Yorkshire, playing for England, and maybe one day leading the team. To now be given that chance means a great deal to me.

""I want to thank my family and coaches who've supported me every step of the way. Their belief in me has made all the difference and I wouldn't be in this position without them.

""There's so much talent in this country, and I'm looking forward to getting started, moving us forward, and working towards winning series, World Cups and major events. I'm excited to get going and give it everything I've got.""

Buttler's tenure as captain began on a high note with England's victory in the 2022 Men's T20 World Cup. However, England have been under the scanner in their recent outings at the ICC tournaments, with a dismal Cricket World Cup in 2023 followed by another unsuccessful title defence at the T20 World Cup in 2024.

During their white-ball tour of India and the Champions Trophy earlier this year, England managed to win only one out of the 11 matches they played across formats, eventually leading to Buttler's resignation from the captaincy. However, the swashbuckling batter confirmed he will continue to feature across formats.

The new skipper's first assignment will begin when England take on West Indies at home across three ODIs and as many T20Is from 29 May, followed by a white-ball series against South Africa at home in September. (ICC)"

• The Colombo West International Terminal (CWIT) will significantly enhance Colombo Port's capacity and ease congestion, boosting overall efficiency.

• The CWIT project is expected to generate employment and contribute meaningfully to Sri Lanka's GDP, driving long-term economic development.

Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. (APSEZ), India's largest integrated transport utility, has announced the commencement of operations at the Colombo West International Terminal (CWIT), located at the Port of Colombo.

Developed under a landmark public-private partnership, CWIT is operated by a consortium comprising India's largest port operator Adani Ports & SEZ Ltd, leading Sri Lankan conglomerate John Keells Holdings PLC, and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, under a 35-year Build, Operate, and Transfer (BOT) agreement.

The CWIT project represents a significant investment of USD 800 million and features a 1,400-metre quay length and 20-metre depth, enabling the terminal to handle approximately 3.2 million Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) annually. It is the first deep-water terminal in Colombo to be fully automated, designed to enhance cargo handling capabilities, improve vessel turnaround times and elevate the port's status as a key transshipment hub in South Asia.

Construction began in early 2022 and has since achieved rapid progress. With the installation of cutting-edge infrastructure now nearing completion, CWIT is poised to set new benchmarks in operational efficiency and reliability in regional maritime logistics.

""The commencement of operations at CWIT marks a momentous milestone in regional cooperation between India and Sri Lanka,"" said Mr Gautam Adani, Chairman of the Adani Group. ""Not only does this terminal represent the future of trade in the Indian Ocean but its opening is also a proud moment for Sri Lanka, placing it firmly on the global maritime map. The CWIT project will create thousands of direct and indirect jobs locally and unlock immense economic value for the island nation. It also stands as a shining example of the deep-rooted friendship and growing strategic ties between the two neighbours, and of what can be achieved through visionary public-private partnerships. Delivering this world-class facility in record time also reflects the Adani Group's proven ability to efficiently execute large-scale critical infrastructure projects anywhere in the world.""

""We are proud to see the progress in the development of the West Container Terminal, a project that strengthens Sri Lanka's position as a regional maritime hub,"" said Mr. Krishan Balendra, Chairperson, John Keells Group.

This marks an increase of over 1.4 million compared to the last census conducted in 2012.

The 2024 enumeration phase--the 15th national census--was carried out between October 2024 and the second week of February 2025. The official census moment was recorded at midnight on 19 December 2024.

The report shows that the country's annual population growth rate has declined from 0.7 percent (2001-2012) to 0.5 percent (2012-2024), indicating a slowdown in growth, though the population continues to rise.

The Western Province remains the most populous, accounting for 28.1 percent of the total population, while the Northern Province reports the lowest share at 5.3 percent.

Gampaha District leads with the highest population of 2,433,685, followed closely by Colombo District with 2,374,461. Kurunegala, Kandy, Kalutara, Ratnapura, and Galle also each recorded populations exceeding one million.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/07/cbsl-annual-review-key-highlights-of-2024/,2025-04-07,CBSL annual review : Key highlights of 2024,"The Annual Economic Review for 2024 (AER 2024) by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka highlights the steady progress of Sri Lanka's economic recovery following the country's most severe downturn in recent history.

The flagship publication of the Central Bank was officially presented to the President and Minister of Finance, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, today.

Accordingly, the key highlights of the Annual Economic Review per the CBSL are as follows;

The Sri Lankan economy continued to recover steadily in 2024, following its deepest economic downturn experienced two years ago. The road to recovery was difficult, but notably faster compared to most debt-distressed countries. Post-crisis reforms have started showing positive outcomes. Signs of improved economic activity, partial recovery in purchasing power, and reduced uncertainty are visible. Election-related uncertainties dissipated towards the latter part of 2024 as signs of the continuation of the reform programme and policy consistency were evident. This, along with the near-completion of external debt restructuring and the country's exit from restricted default rating, has enhanced investor and stakeholder confidence.

In terms of economic growth, Sri Lanka performed better than expected in 2024. Inflation eased and the country entered a period of deflation since September 2024, driven largely by energy price reductions. This resulted in a deviation of inflation from the target on the downside. Supported by low interest rates, credit to households and businesses expanded in 2024. Eased monetary conditions contributed to a faster recovery in domestic economic activity, partly regaining lost output during the pandemic and the economic crisis. Meanwhile, external sector performance remained strong during the year. A notable improvement in external buffers was observed along with the increased net foreign exchange inflows to the country. The external current account continued to record a surplus. The Sri Lankan rupee appreciated under the flexible exchange rate policy. The benefit of currency appreciation trickled down to consumers through low import prices, although it had negative implications for foreign exchange earners. Fiscal sector performance improved notably in 2024, with the primary balance recording a surplus for the second consecutive year.

Building on the achievements in 2023, the focus of the Central Bank's policies was to sustain domestic price stability and financial system stability. In keeping with the priorities under the Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) framework, the Central Bank continued to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance given the benign inflation outlook, thereby supporting domestic economic activity. Meanwhile, due to improved external sector performance, remaining restrictions on imports and capital flows were gradually phased out by the Government in consultation with the Central Bank. Financial system stability was reinforced with the enactment of the Banking (Amendment) Act, which strengthened the legal framework for the governance of licensed banks. Overall performance of the financial sector continued to gradually improve during 2024, supported by improved macrofinancial conditions. A range of regulatory measures on risk management and corporate governance was also introduced during the year. Special focus was also given to the establishment of business revival units in licensed banks to support micro, small and medium-scale enterprises (MSMEs). The Central Bank continued its efforts to enhance financial literacy, promote financial inclusion, and foster digital transformation in the financial sector.

Following the unprecedented crisis in 2022, the country's reform programme aimed to correct deep-rooted structural weaknesses. The need for continued fiscal consolidation was prioritised to achieve debt sustainability while supporting the economic recovery. Special attention was also given by the Government to uplifting the livelihoods of the poor and vulnerable through the implementation of the social safety net programme. Moreover, measures are being taken to address vulnerabilities associated with corruption. A low-inflation - low-interest-rate environment, together with a stable financial sector, has formed a conducive environment for the Sri Lankan economy to achieve its potential. Furthermore, positive market sentiments and stable political conditions, along with macroeconomic policy consistencies, have set the environment for the country to thrive. That said, the heightening of global geopolitical uncertainties, particularly the imposition of the proposed tariffs by the US1 and its spillover effects, could weigh on the external sector and the broader economic outlook. Hence, there is a compelling need for continued prudence in policymaking and further strengthening of external and fiscal buffers.

The Government and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka have taken bold steps to recover the economy from the crisis. The implementation of the IMF-EFF programme and debt restructuring efforts were important pillars of this journey of recovery. It is noteworthy that most of the major reforms to restore stability were frontloaded and completed in the early phase of the macroeconomic adjustment programme. Although notable progress has been achieved, the journey is far from over. Since macroeconomic stability has now been restored to a greater extent, the commitment to embark on the much-needed structural reforms is crucial for the long-term growth of the country, which will ensure the prosperity of all citizens.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/07/crash-and-cover-up-man-takes-police-to-court-over-injustice/,2025-04-07,Crash and cover-up? Man takes Police to court over injustice,"A 29-year-old resident of Colombo was acquitted on March 20 after being wrongfully charged in a 2024 traffic collision involving two officers who are attached to the traffic branch of Borella police.

The incident occurred on Jan. 15, 2024, when a traffic division officer and a female officer, both riding a motorcycle at high speed, collided with another motorcycle at the intersection of Baseline Road and Lesley Ranagala Mawatha, in Colombo.

The second motorcycle, carrying a 29-year-old man and his 67-year-old mother, crashed, leaving the mother hospitalized with a fractured arm.

Without conducting a proper investigation, Borella Police who had reportedly acted in favour of the officers, had at the time proceeded to arrest the son and produced him before the Colombo Magistrate's Court (Case No. 88384/7/24) charging him of causing an accident resulting in injury.

He was also asked to pay Rs. 20,000 in compensation. Soon after the Police pressured man to conclude the case without going into trial.

Challenging the charges, the defendant and his lawyers had sought CCTV footage from nearby cameras, which had not initially been obtained and produced before the court by the Police. It is believed that this was deliberate as the footage clearly indicated that the accused was wrongfully charged. The court later ordered the footage to be submitted.

During the trial, the two officers involved had provided statements that contradicted both the CCTV footage and their original statements recorded at the time of the incident.

Attorneys Bhanuka Malaviarachchi and Malka Denetthi appearing for the defendant had cross-examined the officers, noting the discrepancies in their testimonies.

Citing insufficient evidence and conflicting the officers' behaviour and witness statements, Colombo Additional Magistrate I. N. Rizwan halted the trial and dismissed the case under Section 186 (proviso) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Attorney Malka Denetti, representing the accused, discussed the injustices his client faced throughout the case. Following this, the magistrate recommended legal action against the officers involved.

Although justice was delivered in this case, the police have yet to take any action to support the actual victims--the son and his mother, the Attorneys representing the defendant said.

No steps have been taken to file a case against the traffic police officer who allegedly violated traffic laws and caused the accident. They also urged the public to pursue accountability from those in power rather than accepting the situation as it stands. (Newswire)"
https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/07/factum-perspective-katchatheevu-and-the-indian-media-some-reflections/,2025-04-07,Factum Perspective: Katchatheevu and the Indian Media - Some Reflections,"By Rear Admiral Y. N. Jayarathna (Retd.)

The St Anthony's Church festival in Katchatheevu recently wrapped up for the year. As has been the case for the past many years, both Sri Lankan and Indian Central governments worked hard to ensure that the festival took place with due respect for religious formalities, involving devotees from both countries.

And as has been the case for a long time, the Indian Coast Guard worked in coordination with the Sri Lanka Navy and the Sri Lanka Coast Guard to ensure that sea passages were under their control, guaranteeing safe passage for all devotees.

Both agencies deployed additional manpower and the Sri Lanka Navy in particular took much of the burden in putting up the infrastructure for devotees. The Indian devotees were escorted and handed over to the Sri Lanka Navy at the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) and they were handed back to the Indian Navy on their return.

The writer has had firsthand experience in these formalities when he commanded the capital ship that was deployed for the Festival. He was, and is, well aware of the operating procedures, which are time tested and have endured all this while with much coordination and cooperation between the Navy and the Coast Guard.

This year was no different. The standard arrangements were made, and the feast was concluded without any injuries or casualties. Yet as with previous years, and perhaps more discernibly than ever, the Indian media on social media and blogs appeared to behave in a way that may not be conducive to good relations between the two countries.

In the opinion of this writer, the Indian media perpetuated a picture that created hate and invited troubles in both countries and for both sides. My assessment is based on how so-called journalists covered the feast and how their reporting impacted each country's perception of the other. Clearly, they were fostering anger among Indian audiences, while the Sri Lankans who commented on their posts demonstrated a disturbing level of anti-Indian sentiment. This contradicts the efforts the Indian central government is making to ensure a positive image of itself in Sri Lanka and among Sri Lankans.

I can cite specific examples here. Take this coverage, by India Today. The comments feed reveals a polarizing situation. The media is, of course, pursuing its agenda of more shares and likes and more comments. They seem unaware of the comments that are piling up on their channels, which promote hate and disdain rather than cooperation and good relations. This underscores the troubles that media narratives can create.

Of course, this is hardly the first time something of this sort has happened. Way back in March 2010, one website reported on Katchatheevu extensively citing Indian media sources, specifically ""journalists and social activists from Tamil Nadu."" These ""findings"" were clearly made to stir up the broader India-China factor - which of course remains, then as now, a major selling point for the Indian media in general.

It is clear that the focus of the reporting on the Church Festival is not the festival itself. There is a clear political slant and orientation there. Take its reporting on the issue of Indian fishermen intruding on Sri Lankan waters. The Indian media repeatedly refers to it as a fishing issue. Yet for Sri Lankans, it has become a poaching issue.

Moreover, the India Today reporter cited above seems to have failed in distinguishing the Bay of Bengal from the Palk Strait, hinting that they are ignorant of the ground situation and the history behind the landmark resolution of maritime boundaries in the southern part of the Indian subcontinent, which was finalized many years before the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea came into force.

What Sri Lanka, India, and the Maldives achieved in those days is an example of regional diplomacy and remains so. It is thus questionable as to why the Indian media has set this aside in its pursuit of a political agenda.

These developments make necessary difficult choices. The writer believes that from next year on, Sri Lanka should facilitate only bona fide devotees not media personnel, who, under the cover of journalism, seem to stir up negative sentiments among the population.

Already, official remarks and statements on the island during last year's elections in India have triggered opinions across political divides. This has fueled much anti-Indian feeling. Fortunately, both the Indian Prime Minister and Indian Foreign Minister handled matters diplomatically enough to deflect their criticism not to Sri Lanka but to the Opposition, the Indian Congress Party, which was in power when the Katchatheevu issue was resolved in the 1970s. Yet the Indian media's reporting has enflamed tensions and anti-Indian sentiment in Sri Lanka. Neither Sri Lanka nor India should allow this to escalate.

The tone and the manner of Indian media narratives may jack up ratings for those outlets, but it can rupture understanding at a time when India and Sri Lanka are trying to foster good relations with each other over trade and connectivity. The intense cold war in Tamil Nadu between the traditional political parties and the BJP, and the rivalry among Tamil Nadu's traditional political movers and shakers, which has been augmented by media coverage, can complicate matters - for India and Sri Lanka.

I strongly believe this is both unnecessary and avoidable. The Indian media's reporting on the fishing-cum-poaching issue is a case in point. It is the opinion of this writer that if Indian fishermen stay within their maritime jurisdiction there will be no poaching and virtually no destruction of marine environment due to bottom trawling. Both the Central and State governments, in India and Tamil Nadu, thus need to intervene proactively to ensure that media coverage does not lead to disinformation on these issues.

One year back, the Hindustan Times reported on a ""Chinese radar station"" in Sri Lanka. None of the Indian media outlets reported on this a year later. When the then Navy Commander visited New Delhi as part of an official tour in 2018, the Times of India came up with a news story on a Chinese radar in the south of Sri Lanka that was ""spying on India."" The tone and manner in these reports indicated a brewing war among neighbors in the region.

The truth is that, where the China factor is concerned, the Indian media can obtain tens of thousands of views, shares, and comments for their reporting. This may seem trivial, and governments on both sides can say that it promotes free media. Yet the detrimental impacts of such reporting should not be lost sight of.

Moreover, at a time when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has visited Sri Lanka and is about to leave after penning several crucial agreements with Colombo, this writer feels that the Indian government should pay attention to how sensationalist reporting by media outlets can impact bilateral ties in the longer term. The government must take back control of the narrative. Otherwise, a backlash against such reporting in Sri Lanka can lead to a situation not too dissimilar to 2022, when the power of the people ultimately prevailed over an elected government that had lost its mandate.

Briefing the media on the impact on Sri Lanka, Deputy Minister Anil Jayantha said the tariffs, which come into effect on 09 April, would effectively reduce the competitiveness of Sri Lanka's products.

""The US has asked us to propose ways to reduce our trade deficit with them. We are currently exploring the best strategies to address this issue, including the possibility of revising the existing tariff structure. We have appointed a committee and are conducting discussions on a daily basis. Proposals are being submitted and we will keep everyone informed of the development in due course,"" he said.

Deputy Minister Anil Jayantha further said that Sri Lanka is not among the US Government's group of 'Dirty 15' countries, which are nations with substantial trade deficits that are expected to face higher tariffs.

Also addressing the media, Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning, Harshana Suriyapperuma, said prior to the announcement of the US tariff, a discussion was held with a visiting US delegation on the impending tariff announcement.

""Discussions were held with a US delegation overlooking the region, on the impending situation, to understand what type of an approach Sri Lanka could take. The fact that even though we have a trade deficit from the perspective of the US, the value of that trade deficit is not that significant compared to some of the other countries. An approach was identified to be addressed after the announcement of the actual numbers,"" he said.

Deputy Minister Harshana Suriyapperuma further said that, subsequent to the announcement on tariffs, swift arrangements were made for industry engagements, and as a result, a committee was appointed to discuss further and have a strategy to deal with the way forward.

""A decision was made that Sri Lanka will reach out to a very high-level office representation from the US Administration to discuss the current situation. A virtual discussion was held for nearly an hour. Matters were explained at length, specifically highlighting that we are within the current IMF programme. So revenue consultation measures are taking place. What are the approaches that we need to take? They clarified, based on the information that they have access to at that point in time,"" he said.

Deputy Minister Harshana Suriyapperuma revealed during the discussion, the US delegation clarified that Sri Lanka will be imposed only a 44% tax and not the additional 10% tax.

""They mentioned it is an evolving situation. We will have to wait and see the final decisions on the 09th of April. Depending on how it unfolds, we have to look at the approaches that the other countries are taking, also. So the next meeting is to be scheduled soon, which will discuss more specific outcomes,"" he said.

Deputy Minister Harshana Suriyapperuma said Sri Lanka has suggested a date for the discussion and is awaiting confirmation from the US side.

The clarification comes after the Donald Trump-led US Government recently imposed reciprocal tariffs on several countries, including Sri Lanka.

A 44% tariff was imposed on Sri Lankan goods by the United States under President Donald Trump's revised trade policy.

The move, described by the U.S. as a reciprocal measure in response to what it claims are Sri Lanka's 88% trade barriers on American goods, places Sri Lanka among the countries facing the highest tariff rates globally.

The United States has long been Sri Lanka's most important export destination, accounting for 23% of total merchandise exports in 2024. Of nearly 3 billion in exports to the U.S. last year, the vast majority--over 70%--came from the apparel sector. (Newswire)"

This decision, as per the reports, aims to address overcrowding and safety concerns during Hajj. The Saudi authorities have set April 13, 2025, as the last date for issuing Umrah visas, with no new visas of these types granted to nationals of the affected countries until after Hajj concludes

The complete list of 14 countries impacted by this visa suspension, includes: Algeria, Bangladesh, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sudan, Tunisia, and Yemen.

According to sources, Saudi authorities blamed unregistered participants for the overcrowding and intense heat that killed over 1,200 pilgrims during the Hajj in 2024. These unapproved pilgrims frequently do not have access to basic amenities like lodging, transportation, and healthcare, which makes safety hazards and logistical difficulties worse.

Speaking at a public gathering in Naththandiya, Premadasa said the 44% tax, expected to be implemented on April 9, would severely impact the industry, which sends nearly 40% of its garment exports to the United States. He said the new levy follows Sri Lanka's imposition of an 88% tax on U.S. goods.

""This move will erase our price competitiveness and threaten thousands of jobs,"" Premadasa said, noting that many workers returning home for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year holidays may face uncertainty upon their return.

He said he had raised concerns in Parliament after former U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to increase tariffs on imports following a strong electoral showing. Premadasa criticized the government for failing to act on those warnings, saying its inaction contributed to the current situation.

Premadasa also raised concerns about the broader economic implications, including Sri Lanka's ability to repay a loan due in 2028, originally scheduled for 2033. A decline in export revenue could hamper repayment efforts, he said.

He called for a more proactive government response, including the dispatch of a skilled diplomatic team to engage with U.S. officials and collaboration with other nations to form a joint response.

Premadasa also referenced discussions with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during which he requested increased market access for Sri Lankan garments. He said Sri Lanka currently exports about 8 million garment pieces to India and called for expanded trade opportunities to help cushion the impact of the U.S. tariffs. (NewsWire)"

Chandrasena says he will not end his political activities due to his wife and brother being remanded over corruption charges recently.

Speaking to the reporters, Chandrasena said there may be shortcomings when engaging in politics and other activities.

Stating that he respects the Judiciary, which is an independent institution, he said appeals have been filed before the High Court and Court of Appeal against the court ruling, expressing confidence of receiving a fair ruling.

""During a meeting in Kandy, Minister Lal Kantha, who is my neighbour, questioned anyone who has not done any wrongdoing to raise their hands. But not a single person raised their hand. It is common for shortcomings when engaging in political or other activities. Several people in the political field have faced similar incidents. It is not something to be made fun of,"" he said.

His comments come after his brother, the former North-Central Province Chief Minister S.M. Ranjith, and his wife Shanthini Chandrasena, who served as the latter's former secretary, were sentenced to 16 years of rigorous imprisonment for corruption charges.

S.M. Ranjith, while serving as the North Central Province Chief Minister, is accused of making arrangements to allocate fuel for the official vehicle of his private secretary Shanthini Chandrasena, despite her fuel allowance being already added to her salary.

Shanthini, Chandrasena's wife, served as the private secretary to Ranjith during his tenure as Chief Minister from 2012 to 2014.

The Bribery Commission filed a case against Shanthini Chandrasena for allegedly obtaining fuel worth Rs. 2,680,528 and Rs. 5,379,623 through vouchers during this period.
