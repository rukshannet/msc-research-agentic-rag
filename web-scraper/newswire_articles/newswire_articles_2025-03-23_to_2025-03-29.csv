He called it a mere hoodwink.

Mr Kariapper PC added that this so-called statement by the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) does not contain a single word of condemnaition of the relentless airstrikes and mass killings of the people of Gaza by Israel and its atrocities which continues with the tacit support of the US government.

It is ""shocking and disappointing,"" Mr Kariapper PC added that while various countries are condemning the atrocities of Israel on the people of Palestine, the GoSL, has simply released an eye-wash of a media release on Friday (21) sans no authority's signature, falsely trying to appease to the Muslims of this country.

In the holy month of Ramadan, while the Palestinians are facing genocide amidst various hardships, Israel continues massive attacks killing hundreds of people in Gaza with impunity against all humanitarian and international laws.

The Leader of Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, Rauff Hakeem too has earlier issued a statement condemning the attacks on the Palestinians and spoke in Parliament about the atrocities appealing to the GoSL and the international community for support. He also pointed out that the Sri Lankan government has not made any attempt to condemn this (Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Media Unit)"

Pope Francis, 88, was hospitalized on February 14 with double pneumonia from a severe respiratory infection.

Speaking to journalists on Saturday evening, Doctor Sergio Alfieri, head of the Gemelli Hospital medical team that has been treating the Pope for an acute respiratory tract infection and bilateral pneumonia said ""The good news the world and everyone is waiting for is that tomorrow the Holy Father will be discharged. Tomorrow he will return to Santa Marta.""

Doctor Alfieri, flanked by the Pope's personal physician, Doctor Sergio Carbone, explained that the decision to discharge the Pope follows steady and rapid medical improvements in his clinical condition and the lifting of the prognosis.

He noted that the past week has seen significant improvements. He confirmed that when the Pope was admitted to hospital on 14 February, he was suffering an acute respiratory insufficiency due to a polymicrobial infection that resulted in bilateral pneumonia. This, he explained, necessitated a combined pharmacological treatment.

Answering questions put to him by reporters, Alfieri reiterated that the bilateral pneumonia has been successfully treated, but time is needed for a complete recovery.

Thus, the Pope has been prescribed at least two months of convalescence, during which he will be receiving medical care and will be taking an adequate period of rest.

Alfieri noted that the Holy Father's health is improving steadily, and the hope is he will soon be able to resume a work schedule. This however, he pointed out, does not mean he will immediately be able to start meeting with people and groups as he did before.

Pointing out that throughout his time in the hospital, the doctor said Pope Francis has always stayed in touch with current events, both church-related and political, and - as we have seen - has continued to dedicate himself to work activities.

He is happy to be discharged, he reiterated, and as all doctors agree, ""the best way to recover is to do so at home."" (Vatican News)"

The individuals sanctioned by the UK today include former senior Sri Lankan military commanders, and a former LTTE military commander who later led the paramilitary Karuna Group, operating on behalf of the Sri Lankan military against the LTTE.

The measures, which include UK travel bans and asset freezes, target individuals responsible for a range of violations and abuses, such as extrajudicial killings, during the civil war.

Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, David Lammy, said:

The UK government is committed to human rights in Sri Lanka, including seeking accountability for human rights violations and abuses which took place during the civil war, and which continue to have an impact on communities today.

I made a commitment during the election campaign to ensure those responsible are not allowed impunity. This decision ensures that those responsible for past human rights violations and abuses are held accountable.

The UK government looks forward to working with the new Sri Lankan government to improve human rights in Sri Lanka, and welcomes their commitments on national unity.

During her January visit to Sri Lanka, Minister for the Indo-Pacific, Catherine West MP, held constructive discussions on human rights with the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, civil society organisations, as well as political leaders in the north of Sri Lanka.

For communities to move forward together, there must be acknowledgement, and accountability for past wrongdoing, which the sanctions listings introduced today will support. We want all Sri Lanka communities to be able to grow and prosper.

The UK remains committed to working constructively with the Sri Lankan Government on human rights improvements as well as their broader reform agenda including economic growth and stability. As part of our Plan for Change, the UK recognises that promoting stability overseas is good for our national security.

The UK has long led international efforts to promote accountability in Sri Lanka alongside partners in the Core Group on Sri Lanka at the UN Human Rights Council, which includes Canada, Malawi, Montenegro, and North Macedonia.

Those sanctioned are:

former Head of the Sri Lankan Armed Forces, Shavendra Silva;

former Navy Commander, Wasantha Karannagoda;

former Commander of the Sri Lankan Army, Jagath Jayasuriya;

former military commander of the terrorist group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan. Also known as Karuna Amman, he subsequently created and led the paramilitary Karuna Group, which worked on behalf of the Sri Lankan Army."

Accordingly, this requirement also applies to Sri Lankan migrant workers, the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment stated.

In collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Sri Lankan Embassy in Bahrain, Sri Lanka is set to implement a vaccination programme for its citizens travelling to Bahrain, based on the guidelines issued by the Bahraini government and the Gulf Cooperation Council.

Meningococcal disease is an infectious illness caused by the Neisseria meningitidis bacterium, which can be fatal if left untreated. Meningitis is a contagious disease and is recognized as a leading cause of illness, death, and disability in both developed and developing countries.

Health authorities have highlighted the importance of the meningococcal vaccine as a crucial part of immunization strategies, particularly in regions with a high concentration of migrant workers, to minimize the risk of disease transmission. The Gulf Cooperation Council has also recommended its inclusion.

The mandatory vaccination aims to safeguard the health of workers and prevent potential outbreaks, aligning with broader public health goals.

Bahrain has long been a popular destination for Sri Lankan migrant workers, and that trend continues to grow. The Bureau of Foreign Employment revealed that over 4,000 Sri Lankan workers departed for employment in Bahrain in 2024 alone. (NewsWire)"

The discussions centered on multiple audit findings spanning several years, revealing severe irregularities in vehicle registrations and substantial losses to the state.

One of the key issues discussed was a racket uncovered in a 2019 audit involving the fraudulent import of luxury vehicles.

158 vehicles had been imported under licenses intended for religious institutions using altered names and forged documentation, the COPA revealed citing the 2019 audit.

Additionally, the manufacturing dates of 120 vehicles were changed before registration, the audit reveals.

In response, DMT officials said disciplinary action had been taken against an implicated employee, including an inquiry by the Ministry of Public Administration.

A clerk who was interdicted was later reinstated due to lack of sufficient evidence. COPA members, however, expressed concern over the lack of accountability and the precedent it sets for public sector conduct, in addition to the loss in government revenue.

The committee also reviewed more recent audit findings covering 2020 to 2023. It was revealed that due to the failure to charge prescribed registration fees for 296 motorcycles with engine capacities between 201cc and 450cc, the state incurred a loss of Rs. 78.15 million. Further, 3,088 motorcycles were registered without Cabinet approval or required legal documentation.

A comprehensive review was conducted on 25 audit points related to illegal vehicle registrations made before the integration of the Sri Lanka Customs computer system.

COPA criticized the department's failure to act on these issues, noting that reports submitted were inadequate. The committee called for immediate disciplinary action and the appointment of an independent investigation team.

Among the other serious findings were:
•⁠ ⁠Fraudulent vehicle registration certificates issued by using engine and chassis numbers from illegally imported vehicles, causing a loss of Rs. 1.2 billion.
•⁠ ⁠Unauthorized issuance of certificates for unused vacant registration numbers, leading to a loss of Rs. 6.2 million.
•⁠ ⁠Misuse of diplomatic registration numbers for non-diplomatic vehicles, resulting in a loss of Rs. 122 million.

DMT officials also acknowledged critical issues within their operational system, citing the lack of a service agreement with the system provider. Despite these shortcomings, they maintained that external access to the system is not possible.

Following these revelations, COPA recommended that disciplinary action be taken against all responsible officials and that progress be reviewed monthly. The committee also urged legal authorities to pursue criminal investigations where applicable and stressed on the need for greater public awareness of the irregularities. (Newswire)"

""They say that if you plant trees, invest, or grow fruits, or even cultivate something like vegetables, you will earn big profits.

The number of Trojan banker attacks on Android smartphones increased from 420,000 in 2023 to 1,242,000 in 2024. Trojan banker malware is designed to steal user credentials for online banking, e-payment services and credit card systems.

Cybercriminals trick victims into downloading Trojan bankers by spreading links via SMS or messaging apps, as well as through malicious attachments in messengers, and by directing users to malicious webpages. They can even send messages from a hacked contact's account, making the fraud appear more trustworthy. To deceive users, attackers often exploit trending news and hype topics to create a sense of urgency and lower victims' guard.

""Scammers have started to scale down their efforts to create unique malware packages, focusing instead on distributing the same files to as many victims as possible. It is more important than ever to be cyber-literate and educate your loved ones - from children to the elderly - because no one is completely safe from well-crafted scams and psychological tricks designed to steal banking data,"" says Anton Kivva, a security expert at Kaspersky.

Although Trojan bankers are the fastest-growing type of malware, they rank fourth overall in terms of the share of attacked users at 6%. The most widespread category remains AdWare, accounting for 57% of attacked users, followed by general Trojans (25%) and RiskTools (12%). The ranking includes malware, adware and unwanted software.

In 2024, cybercriminals launched an average of 2.8 million malware, adware, and unwanted software attacks on mobile devices each month. Over the year, Kaspersky products blocked a total of 33.3 million attacks.

In 2024, Fakemoney, a group of scam apps designed for fake investments and payouts, was the most active threat. Another major concern was modified versions of WhatsApp that contained the Triada-type Trojan - a malware that can download and execute additional malicious or adware modules, for example, to display advertisements or perform other unwanted actions. These unofficial WhatsApp mods ranked third in activity, just behind a general category of cloud-based generic threats.

Downloading apps from official stores like the Apple App Store and Google Play is not always risk-free. Kaspersky recently discovered SparkCat, the first screenshot-stealing malware to bypass the App Store's security. The malware was also found on Google Play, with a total of 20 infected apps across both platforms, proving that these stores are not 100% foolproof. To stay safe, always check app reviews and download numbers when possible, use only links from official websites, and install reliable security software, like Kaspersky Premium, that can detect and block malicious activity if an app turns out to be fraudulent.

Check the permissions of apps that you use and think carefully before permitting an app, especially when it comes to high-risk permissions such as Accessibility Services. For example, the only permission that a flashlight app needs is the flashlight (which doesn't even involve camera access). A good piece of advice is to update your operating system and important apps as updates become available. Many safety issues can be solved by installing updated versions of software."

Medical experts state that the only effective way to control the spread of Chikungunya is by eliminating mosquito breeding sites as much as possible.

The Chikungunya virus, which is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito, has been identified across regions in Africa, the Americas, Europe, Asia, and islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans.

Authorities also point out that the disease can spread to unaffected regions through infected travelers, posing a further risk of expansion.

They further warned that Sri Lanka is currently witnessing a re-emergence of the disease, especially in certain urban zones.

With school holidays ongoing, children are more exposed to outdoor environments, and recent rainfall in some areas may contribute to a rise in mosquito density. Therefore, the public is urged to remain vigilant, destroy mosquito breeding places, and maintain clean surroundings to prevent further spread.

According to the World Health Organization, the common signs and symptoms of Chikungunya include:

- Sudden onset of fever

- Joint pain, often severe and commonly affecting the hands and feet

-  Muscle pain

-  Headache

-  Nausea

-  Fatigue

-  Rash

Symptoms typically appear four to eight days after a mosquito bite but can range from two to 12 days. Most patients recover fully, but joint pain may persist for weeks or months in some cases. Chikungunya is rarely fatal, though it can be more severe in older adults, newborns, and individuals with underlying health conditions. (NewsWire)"

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/25/worlds-longest-serving-death-row-prisoner-awarded-1-4-million-after-acquittal/,2025-03-25,World's longest-serving death row prisoner awarded $1.4 million after acquittal,"A Japanese man who spent more than 40 years on death row until he was acquitted last year has been awarded $1.4 million in compensation, a court said on Tuesday - roughly $85 for each day he was wrongfully convicted.

Former professional boxer Iwao Hakamata, 89, was sentenced to death in 1968 for a quadruple murder despite repeatedly alleging that the police had fabricated evidence against him.

Once the world's longest-serving death row inmate, he was acquitted after a DNA test showed that the bloodstained clothing which was used to convict him was planted long after the murders, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK.

The Shizuoka District Court confirmed to CNN that Hakamata had been awarded more than 217 million yen - a payout that represents about US$85 per day since he was found guilty.

His legal representative Hideyo Ogawa described the compensation as the ""highest amount"" ever handed out for a wrongful conviction in Japan, but said it could never make up for what Hakamata had suffered.

""I think the state (government) has made a mistake that cannot be atoned for with 200 million yen,"" the lawyer said, according to NHK.

Hakamata retired as a professional boxer in 1961 and got a job at a soybean processing plant in Shizuoka, central Japan.

Five years later he was arrested by police after his boss, his boss' wife and their two children were found stabbed to death in their home.

Hakamata initially admitted to the charges against him, but later changed his plea, accusing police of forcing him to confess by beating and threatening him.

He was sentenced to death in a 2-1 decision by judges in 1968.

The one dissenting judge stepped down from the bar six months later, demoralized by his inability to stop the sentencing.

Hakamata, who has maintained his innocence ever since, would go on to spend more than half his life waiting to be hanged.

New evidence led to his release in 2014 pending a retrial, which acquitted him last year.

His case brought global scrutiny to Japan's criminal justice system, where conviction rates stand at 99%, according to the Ministry of Justice website, and fueled calls to abolish the death penalty in the country.

Hakamata's sister Hideko, who had long campaigned for his release, told CNN last year that decades of imprisonment had wrought irreversible damage on her brother's mental health.

Hakamata was ""living in his own world,"" she said.

""Sometimes he smiles happily, but that's when he's in his delusion... We have not even discussed the trial with Iwao because of his inability to recognize reality."" (CNN)"

The legal notice, issued through attorney-at-law B.M. Thamila Dinushi Perera, alleges that Factcrescendo falsely labeled a Facebook post made by Maithree on February 8, 2025, as ""digitally manipulated"" and misleading, without verifying its authenticity.

The original post referenced a controversial post from the official Tamil-language Facebook page of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, which included an image of Sitha Arambepola with offensive language. The original post was later deleted from the President's page.

In his post, Maithree speculated that the controversial content may have been mistakenly published by a page administrator, citing similar incidents under previous administrations. However, Factcrescendo claimed in its fact-check that the screenshot was digitally altered using tools like Photoshop and deemed the content unauthentic. The fact-check included a screenshot of Maithree's post, which, according to the legal notice, implied intentional fabrication.

The legal letter further argues that Factcrescendo's actions damaged Maithree's professional reputation, credibility, and business interests, including a decline in online reviews.

Although the original fact-check article was later edited by Factcrescendo to include reader feedback suggesting the controversial post did appear on the President's official page, Maithree's legal team states that the outlet failed to properly update the public or issue a formal clarification.

The notice demands that Factcrescendo:

1. Remove all false and defamatory statements across all platforms,

2. Issue a public apology and correction,

3. Pay Rs. 50 million for reputational damages,

4. Pay another Rs. 50 million for harm caused to dignity and self-esteem.

It also warns that failure to comply will result in legal action being initiated without further notice. (NewsWire)"

And after decades of the West being the engine of the global economy, it's now the turn of the East to be the growth engine.

India is now poised to be the growth engine of the world, and South Asia has a unique opportunity to reap the rewards of this shift in the economic epicenter from the West to its own backyard.

India and Sri Lanka have engaged in mutually beneficial economic relationships for millennia. And even today, many Indian goods moving eastwards utilise the state-of-the-art port facilities in Colombo.

With India poised to become the second largest economy in the world by 2075 (FT report) and becoming the fastest growing economy in the world, the time is right to foster even closer mutually beneficial business ties between India and Sri Lanka.

Lanka India Business Association (LIBA) is now in operation in Sri Lanka to further enhance the already close ties between Indian and Sri Lankan businesses.

Santosh Menon, President of LIBA said ""Sri Lanka has forever been a global trading powerhouse. Its high-quality cinnamon, pepper and more recently 'Ceylon Tea' has been sought after commodities around the world. Its high-quality skill at garment making makes it a chosen supplier for some of the world's most fastidious brands. The time has come to now engage more actively with the Indian market and find the right ways to exploit it. We formed LIBA to foster and facilitate closer and more meaningful links between Indian and Sri Lankan businesses.""

His Excellency Santosh Jha, High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka said ""India and Sri Lanka have longstanding civilizational links, with economic and commercial relationship naturally being an integral part of it. I look forward to LIBA further strengthening and fostering closer ties among the business community from both countries. I welcome this initiative and wish Santosh Menon, President of LIBA and the founding members of the Governing Council much success in achieving their goals.""

Aroshi Nanayakkara, Vice president of LIBA said ""Sri Lanka has a highly skilled work force with a proven ability of supplying the world's most premium brands. Our literacy rates, quality of life indicators and natural hospitality equip us to be exceptional business partners helping us build long term relationships, bringing benefits not only to the partnering organisations but also to their respective countries.  We are keen to provide potential investors with a platform to invest in Sri Lanka and we are confident that LIBA will be that platform.""

Prakash Schaffter, Governing Council member said ""Our geographical location has been our strength as we are strategically placed in the sea lanes which are a crossroad for trade between the East and the West. And now with South Asia poised to be the centre stage of trade we must use our proximity to India to our advantage.""

Ashique Ali, Governing council member said ""In the areas of digital and start-ups, we are building closer ties with India, to benefit from the learnings in the area. Many of our home-grown tech products are of the highest quality and we want to make sure that they will be able to maximise the benefits of being close to India.""

Nevindaree Premarathne, Governing Council member speaking of her own experience said "" I have a business related to STEM education and I see a big demand in India for this new method of creative teaching. I am happy to provide this high-quality product to the Indian market. As a LIBA council member, I will be reaching out and educating others on the opportunities in India.""

Dilshan Rodrigo added ""As a banker, I see the MSME sector in Sri Lanka in which there are people who have strong entrepreneurial skills, and who want to go beyond their traditional markets to something bigger and better. We will try to provide them with the opportunity through LIBA.

Samanthi Dias stated that India and Sri Lanka, both being Commonwealth countries, have similarities in the legal systems, and the cross-border networking could help Sri Lanka to shape the legal framework, and policies in evolving sectors such as commercial, trade, artificial intelligence and intellectual property.

Sandeep Holey, Director and Country Head, UltraTech Cement, Sri Lanka, LIBA is set to be a key player in advancing the relationship between India and Sri Lanka, enabling businesses and professionals to ""Grow Together"" through knowledge sharing, networking, and collaboration.

Santosh Menon concluded by saying ""Our governing council represents very senior professionals and businesspeople from a myriad of industries and backgrounds in Sri Lanka. Both from a gender context as well as from an India/ Sri Lanka context, it's a diverse and inclusive team. We are also committed to working with existing trade and business-related chambers and other institutions. We will have a strategic approach to deliver our vision.""

In a pioneering move for Sri Lanka's retail sector, Singer PLC, in collaboration with Roar AdX, has successfully bridged the gap between digital advertising and in-store purchases. By leveraging Meta's offline tracking tools, this initiative has redefined data-driven retail marketing in the country, proving that online campaigns can directly drive showroom sales. For the first time, a Sri Lankan retailer has implemented a digital-first, offline sales campaign--challenging traditional marketing approaches and unlocking new opportunities for omnichannel engagement.

""This initiative marks a paradigm shift in how brands measure the impact of digital advertising,"" said Sonali Wijewardena, Manager - Customer Success at Roar AdX. ""By integrating Meta's offline tracking capabilities, Singer has set a new industry standard, showing that digital marketing is not just about online conversions but also a powerful tool for influencing in-store transactions.""

The results speak for themselves. Singer's November sales strategy, which included the highly anticipated 11.11 online exclusive sale and Black Friday campaigns, delivered remarkable outcomes. Meta-attributed revenue saw a fourfold (4X) increase year-on-year, with an extraordinary 128x return on ad spend during seasonal sales. Sixty percent (60%) of the revenue from Meta-driven ads came from offline, in-store purchases, demonstrating the strong influence of digital in driving showroom traffic. Additionally, Meta's overall contribution to Singer's total revenue surged to 12%, a notable leap from just 2% the previous year.

""This data-driven approach has completely transformed our marketing playbook,"" said Paba Weerasekara, Senior Integrated Communications Manager at Singer Sri Lanka. ""The ability to track offline sales linked to our digital campaigns has not only boosted revenue but also reinforced the effectiveness of digital marketing in delivering real business impact.""

Pesala Jayasuriya, Assistant Manager - Digital Marketing at Singer Sri Lanka, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing that partnering with Roar AdX to implement Meta's offline purchase tracking was a game-changer. By accurately measuring how digital ads influence showroom sales, Singer has unlocked valuable insights into customer behaviour and campaign performance.

Retail analysts have long observed that while product discovery happens largely online, high-value purchases, particularly in consumer electronics, still take place in-store. Singer aimed to bridge this gap through a data-driven omnichannel strategy, seamlessly integrating online advertising with real-time offline tracking. With the success of this initiative, more Sri Lankan retailers may explore similar models to enhance their marketing ROI, particularly in sectors where in-person purchases remain dominant.

""As Sri Lanka's retail ecosystem evolves, businesses that want to maximize their marketing effectiveness will increasingly turn to real-time data tracking and omnichannel strategies that merge digital engagement with offline conversions. Singer PLC's success is proof that the future of retail marketing isn't just online, it's omnichannel."" concluded Udara Dharmasena from Roar AdX.

The UK Government imposed sanctions on former head of the Sri Lankan Armed Forces Shavendra Silva, former Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda, former Commander of the Sri Lankan Army Jagath Jayasuriya and former LTTE military commander Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias Karuna Amman.

Taking to 'X', SLPP MP Namal Rajapaksa said Sri Lanka was the first nation to fully defeat terrorism, yet the West continues to selectively target Sri Lankan war veterans while ignoring those who funded and justified LTTE brutality.

He further said the latest UK sanctions aren't about human rights and that they are the result of relentless LTTE-backed lobbying, manipulating foreign governments to act against those who brought lasting peace.

""This is not justice; some Western politicians are enjoying the perks of lobbying money, putting our nation's reconciliation at risk. People from both the North and South must understand that the freedom we enjoy today comes from tough decisions. These sanctions will lower the morale of our forces, and if another crisis arises, they may lack the courage to fight if we don't support them now.

""Those behind these sanctions don't care about the safety of the Tamil community--they are only creating more problems and further jeopardizing reconciliation. Their real goal is to disrupt the progress made, especially as Tamil communities in the North and East now have a clear path to vote for national parties.

Sri Lanka has taken another step towards making its mark in the global luxury market, this time in the world of fine perfumery. In a moment of national pride, Keva --one of the world's largest and most influential fragrance manufacturers--has acknowledged a Sri Lankan perfume for its quality and craftsmanship.

With a legacy spanning over a century, Keva operates on a global scale, supplying fragrance compositions to some of the biggest names in beauty and luxury. The company has a presence in Europe, North America, India, and Southeast Asia, shaping the world's olfactory landscape with its expertise in scent innovation and fine perfumery.

For a company of this stature to take note of a Sri Lankan perfume is a moment worth celebrating--a testament to the fact that Sri Lanka can create world-class luxury products capable of earning international recognition.

A Global Industry Leader Recognizes a Sri Lankan-Made Fragrance

During a recent meeting between Mr. Ramesh Vaze, Chairman of Keva, and Shaakir Buzrook, Co-Founder of Unbox Ceylon, Mr. Vaze personally experienced ""Yara Ceylin"", a fragrance created by the Sri Lankan perfume house. After trying it, he extended his best wishes, acknowledging the dedication to quality and craftsmanship behind the scent.

The significance of this moment cannot be overstated. Keva has developed some of the finest perfumes in the world, working alongside leading global fragrance brands. For a Sri Lankan-made scent to receive recognition from such a powerhouse speaks volumes about the potential of the country's fragrance industry.

""Unbox Ceylon has quietly been working towards creating something special, and this recognition from Keva is proof that Sri Lankan craftsmanship can stand alongside some of the best in the world,"" an industry expert commented. ""It's encouraging to see a homegrown brand earn validation from a company that has been instrumental in shaping global perfumery for over a century.""

A Moment of Pride for Sri Lanka

While Sri Lanka is known for its rich heritage, natural beauty, and fine craftsmanship, the luxury fragrance industry has remained largely untapped--until now. The recognition from Keva signals that Sri Lanka's perfume industry is ready to step onto the global stage.

This achievement is not just about one brand; it is a moment for the entire country to take pride in. Sri Lanka is now proving that it can produce high-quality, globally competitive fragrances.

The Future of Sri Lankan Perfumery

This milestone could be a turning point for Sri Lanka's emerging fragrance industry. As the country moves towards establishing itself in the global luxury market, homegrown brands like Unbox Ceylon are showing that Sri Lanka is more than capable of creating world-class products.

With a strong commitment to quality, craftsmanship, and authentic storytelling, Sri Lanka is taking its first confident steps toward becoming a recognized player in fine perfumery.

• Kicks off with four specialty agencies - Ad Hoc, White Label, View-Thru Media, and Hackvertising Core.

• Rolling out in Colombo, London, Toronto, and Dubai.

Digital marketing industry veteran Shalendra Mendis, after a trailblazing decade at the helm of the largest multinational digital agency in Sri Lanka, has ventured into an ambitious new journey, launching The Hackvertising Network (www.hackvertising.net).

Inspired by an enduring passion for the practice of ""Hackvertising,"" which has won Shalendra numerous global and regional awards, the Hackvertising Network aims to bring the same mindset to rethink not only client outcomes but also the advertising industry models themselves.

""Completely reimagining how advertising works is the overarching aim of The Hackvertising Network. Reorganizing talent in smarter ways, fixing long-term industry pain points, leveraging AI beyond the buzzword and creating specialized client solutions are some of our key focus areas"" Shalendra said, underscoring the network's mission to drive meaningful change in the industry.

Ad Hoc (www.Adhoc.lk), coined by Shalendra as the industry's first-ever dedicated ""Deadline Agency,"" tackles a persistent advertising reality: last-minute deadlines that disrupt even the most meticulous plans. While general agencies often scramble to reprioritize workflows for urgent requests, Ad Hoc operates as a 100% deadline-focused entity, eliminating inefficiencies by specializing exclusively in short-term turnarounds.

White Label aims to provide a unique, curated, white-labeled solution for any type of digital design or development requirement. This model unlocks many benefits for both brands and agencies. More on this can be found at www.Whitelabel.lk.

View-Thru Media is a YouTube-first video ad agency that leverages Shalendra's vast experience in scaling video advertising presence for brands and advocates for a video-first approach to digital marketing.

Finally, Hackvertising Core forms a consulting arm that combines the Hackvertising philosophy and deep digital expertise to provide impactful value unlocks for entities across private and public sectors.

In conclusion, Shalendra stated, ""In the coming months, we will continue to unveil bold new models that adress critical industry challenges. Our aim is to be continuously inventive and experimental, moving with speed toward market truths while unapologetically adjusting & evolving our offering for markets across the globe.""

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/26/risks-of-over-reliance-on-china-what-bangladesh-can-learn-from-sri-lanka-and-the-maldives/,2025-03-26,Risks of Over-Reliance on China: What Bangladesh Can Learn from Sri Lanka and the Maldives,"By Vaishali Basu Sharma

Traveling on a flight arranged by the Chinese government, Bangladesh interim government Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus is heading a 57-member delegation, which includes Foreign Adviser Touhid Hossain, along with officials and security personnel to China for a four day visit. He is scheduled to meet President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 28.

It is clear that Muhammad Yunus, has not prioritized relations with India since taking office in August 2024. Reports suggest that he has yet to visit India, which some interpret as a sign of strained ties. This shift comes after the removal of Sheikh Hasina, a long-time ally of India, from power. Yunus's growing engagement with China, including his current visit, has further highlighted this diplomatic cooling

It does seem that Yunus is adopting a strategy to leverage relations with China, potentially as a counterbalance to India, given the strained ties with the latter. Bangladesh's proximity to India has historically ensured strong ties, yet China's vast investments and diplomatic courting can present appealing alternatives for leadership looking to recalibrate relations. If Yunus continues this approach, it could shift Bangladesh's geopolitical alignment, potentially making it heavily dependent on China, and possibly leading to a more complex situation.

This tactic--playing one regional power against the other--isn't uncommon for smaller nations seeking to amplify their influence or secure greater economic and strategic benefits. China's economic power and investments can provide significant benefits, such as infrastructure development, trade opportunities, and financial aid. On the other hand, this dependency can create vulnerabilities, especially if China's policies or economic conditions shift.For instance, nations relying on Chinese loans for infrastructure projects may face debt challenges, as seen in cases like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Maldives in South Asia. Additionally, over-reliance on Chinese trade can expose countries to economic risks if demand fluctuates or geopolitical tensions arise. Balancing these benefits and risks is a delicate act for many nations.

During his visit to China, Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus is set to hold a high-level meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Bangladesh plans to prioritize economic cooperation, while China is expected to focus on broader political collaboration, emphasizing the One China principle and encouraging Bangladesh to join Xi Jinping's Global Development Initiative (GDI).

According to discussions with several diplomatic sources, it has been revealed that Bangladesh prioritizes financial and developmental assistance, while China is less inclined to focus on economic cooperation. Instead, China views economic cooperation as one component of the relationship, emphasizing that collaboration should also be approached from a political perspective to elevate Dhaka-Beijing ties to the next level, considering this approach to be pragmatic.

Beijing is urging Dhaka to reaffirm its strong support for the One-China principle and its stance on the Taiwan issue, consistent with the position Bangladesh maintained in the 2005 joint communique. This aligns with China's broader diplomatic strategy to ensure unwavering support from its partners on sensitive issues like Taiwan.

Bangladesh's deepening engagement with China could have several repercussions. But more importantly its increased reliance on Chinese investments and loans might expose Bangladesh to debt risks, as seen in other countries involved in China's Belt and Road Initiative. Sri Lanka's experience serves as a cautionary tale about the risks of over-reliance on Chinese investments and loans. The country faced significant debt challenges, particularly with projects under China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). For example, Sri Lanka had to lease the Hambantota Port to a Chinese company after struggling to repay the loans associated with its development. This situation highlights how dependency on high-interest loans for large-scale infrastructure projects can lead to financial strain and loss of strategic assets.

Maldives and Pakistan provide further examples of how increased reliance on Chinese investments and loans can lead to significant debt risks. The Maldives has faced mounting debt challenges, with external debt reaching $3.4 billion, a significant portion owed to China. The China-Maldives Free Trade Agreement has exacerbated economic vulnerabilities, with Maldivian exports making up less than 3% of bilateral trade. The country is now struggling to service upcoming debt repayments, including $600 million in 2025 and $1 billion in 2026.

The Maldives' Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with China has sparked concerns about its potential impact on the Maldives' economic sovereignty and independence. Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), Chairman Fayyaz Ismail, a former economic development minister, criticized the agreement following its revival under President Muizzu. He argued that as a country heavily reliant on imports--95% of its goods are imported--the Maldives must prioritize trade policies that safeguard its economic sovereignty. Eliminating tariffs for Chinese goods, Fayyaz cautioned, would flood the market with cheaper Chinese products, undermining local businesses and limiting the Maldives' ability to diversify trade partnerships.

The agreement exemplifies how smaller nations can face significant challenges when balancing economic partnerships with larger powers like China. It underscores the importance of maintaining independence and ensuring that trade agreements benefit the domestic economy.

Pakistan's case highlights the potential pitfalls of over-reliance on Chinese financing, particularly when terms are opaque or heavily skewed in favor of the lender. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), initially hailed as a transformative project, has placed Pakistan under immense financial strain. With loans tied to high-interest rates and stringent repayment terms, Pakistan owes approximately $28.78 billion to China, accounting for 22% of its external public debt. Projects like Gwadar Port have faced criticism for benefiting China more than Pakistan, further deepening the economic burden.

Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu's recent shift toward a softer stance on India marks a departure from his earlier position when he took office, advocating for the withdrawal of Indian troops and promoting China-backed projects. His campaign placed the Maldives at the center of the India-China rivalry, with both powers vying for influence over the strategically located Indian Ocean nation. Breaking with the tradition of Maldivian presidents visiting India first after elections, Muizzu chose Turkey and China instead.Muizzu had sought to reduce reliance on India by pursuing a more independent foreign policy and fostering closer ties with China.

However, India's recent bailout has highlighted the limitations of this approach. Muizzu, who was seen as a leading figure in the ""India Out"" movement, worked to restore relations with India before the end of 2024, in an attempt to reinstate the soured ties.

Sri Lanka's debt crisis is a cautionary tale of economic mismanagement and over-reliance on external loans, particularly from China. Sri Lanka borrowed heavily from China to fund large-scale infrastructure projects, such as the Hambantota Port and Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport. While these projects were intended to boost economic growth, many were criticized as being economically unviable, leading to limited returns on investment.

By 2022, Sri Lanka's external debt had ballooned to unsustainable levels, with China being one of its largest creditors. The country struggled to meet its debt obligations, and in April 2022, it defaulted on its sovereign debt for the first time in history. Sri Lankans faced shortages of essential goods, skyrocketing inflation, and prolonged power outages. These conditions sparked widespread protests, culminating in the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

Amid the crisis, India stepped in to provide critical support. It extended financial assistance worth over $4 billion, including credit lines and grants, to help stabilize Sri Lanka's economy. This aid was instrumental in addressing immediate needs and securing an International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout.

Sri Lanka's experience underscores the risks of over-reliance on external loans without careful consideration of their economic viability.

Muhammad Yunus should learn from Sri Lanka and the Maldives about the risks of over-reliance on China. To avoid similar pitfalls, Yunus should ensure transparency, economic viability, and balanced partnerships in Bangladesh's dealings with China.

Under the act, a proposal seeking the removal of the IGP must be endorsed by more than 75 members of Parliament. Jayathissa explained that a proposal signed by 115 MPs has already been handed over to the Speaker.

On Tuesday, a motion to remove Tennakoon was submitted by a group of National People's Power (NPP) lawmakers, outlining 27 corruption allegations against the police chief. Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has endorsed the move, stating the Samagi Jana Balawegaya will fully support it.

Minister Jayathissa said the government is confident the motion will be passed in Parliament.

Explaining the constitutional provisions for removing an Inspector General of Police, Minister Jayathissa said the proposal must be taken up during the next parliamentary sitting, scheduled for April 8 or 9, and adopted by a majority.

Concurrently, an investigation committee must be appointed to deliberate on the removal. The committee is primarily nominated by the Chief Justice and includes a sitting Supreme Court judge, the chairman of the National Police Commission, and a senior administrative official.

Following the committee's inquiry, a report must be submitted to the Speaker and approved by Parliament.

Addressing concerns over ongoing court proceedings, Jayathissa said the parliamentary process would not hinder the legal case concerning Tennakoon's appointment.

""All allegations will be investigated,"" he said, noting the urgency of the matter and the need to expedite the process.

""There are claims that he received salaries from other institutions while serving in the state, and questions have been raised about a distillery at his residence. The Criminal Investigation Department will look into these matters.""

Jayathissa also said the suspended police chief's travel history would also be investigated, though details may not be disclosed to the media.

""Investigations are underway, and there is no reason for fear. There are no elites-- the law will be applied equally to all,"" he added. (Newswire)"

In a post on X Premadasa criticized the recent reduction in solar feed-in tariffs, calling it an act of 'absolute corruption' with 'no economic logic'.

""I've never said this before. But it's time we call it, the fuel cartel runs this government. Every renewable project is blocked or buried. Now they've cut solar tariffs. No economic logic whatsoever just absolute corruption,"" he said.

The Opposition Leader's statement comes after the Solar Industries Association (SIA) announced its opposition to a proposed reduction in rooftop solar feed-in tariffs in Sri Lanka, warning it could harm over 1,000 businesses and 40,000 jobs.

In a letter to the Treasury Secretary, the SIA said lowering tariffs from Rs. 27 and Rs. 23 to Rs. 19 and Rs. 14 would damage the fastest-growing segment in renewable energy, which contributed over 500 MW in 2024. The group urged the Ministry of Finance to revise the proposal, citing concerns over cost assumptions and its potential impact on clean energy goals. (Newswire)"
https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/26/how-indias-drone-initiative-can-empower-south-african-women-in-agriculture/,2025-03-26,How India's drone initiative can empower South African women in agriculture,"THIS past week, we celebrated International Women's Day in South Africa and the world. As we reflect on the historical day, we are also obligated to revisit our commitment as South Africans to the emancipation of women in our country, particularly rural women.

Rural women in South Africa continue to bear the brunt of triple oppression due to their race, class, and gender; hence, it is not a coincidence that in their majority they have not managed to achieve economic freedom.

This situation is no different from the realities of many women in the Global South, and one country in particular that is also confronted with this circumstance is India. The patriarchal norms in India have hindered women's progress in the country, but a lot is seemingly being done by the Indian government to effect change.

One such programme is ""The Drone Didi Initiative"" for rural women, which can be used as a yardstick in South Africa to resolve the challenge of gender-based inequality in rural communities, solve food security challenges, alleviate poverty, and create jobs.

The India program to provide women with agricultural  drones, launched in 2019, provides women with practical, technology-driven skills with the intention of creating immediate income-generating opportunities and resolving other imminent socioeconomic challenges.

According to reports, the initial number of rural women who were trained to deploy the drones was 500, with 200 drones deployed. Today: ""Over 5 000 women are part of the program, with 1 500 drones in operation.""

In rural provinces across South Africa, rural women are often the backbone of agricultural activities but remain under-represented. Adopting a similar initiative could empower these women, enabling them to contribute more effectively to the development of their own lives, families, communities, and the country.

Currently, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations Food Program (UNFP) affirm that technology and innovation are key enablers to save and change lives around the world. To that end, drones enable precision agriculture, improving crop health and yields.

In India, the Drone Didi initiative has led to a 25% increase in crop yields and a 30% reduction in pesticide use. In South Africa, smallholder farmers still struggle to compete. By equipping rural women with drones, South Africa could be a game changer.

For example, rural areas in South Africa, such as KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape, pose significant logistical challenges due to their difficult terrain.  Drones can be particularly useful in these areas, enabling farmers to monitor and manage their crops more efficiently and safely.

Equally, drones can facilitate the transportation of harvested crops from remote areas to local markets, reducing costs and increasing accessibility.

To that end, the India Drone Didi initiative demonstrates how technology can create economic opportunities in underserviced regions. In India, women are earning significant incomes, with an average increase of 50% in their household income.

According to a recent report by McKinsey Global Institute titled, 'Dependency and depopulation? Confronting the consequences of a new demographic reality', India, which has the largest population in the world, has the potential to become the second largest economy per purchasing power parity by 2050 if the country aggressively pushes women to participate in the mainstream economy.

As BRICS members, India and South Africa can collaborate on agricultural innovation. India's success with drone Didi can serve as a case study, offering insights into implementation and scaling up.

Furthermore, local institutions such as the Agricultural Research Council (ARC), Innovation Hub, and Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) can play a crucial role in shaping rural women farm worker cooperatives using drone technology and scaling operations.

Moreover, this initiative can foster social change by challenging patriarchal norms, promoting gender equality, and also uplifting households. As more women get empowered, the entire family stands to benefit.

Drones can also be beneficial for pregnant women and new mothers in rural areas as they reduce the need for physical labour. Drones can help these women maintain their farms while ensuring their health and well-being are being taken care of.

For South Africa, this initiative represents a unique opportunity to transform rural communities, empower women, and modernise agriculture. By embracing this initiative and leveraging local expertise, South Africa can unlock a brighter future for its rural women and communities. (The Guardian)"

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/26/muhammad-yunus-faces-criticism-over-press-repression-in-bangladesh/,2025-03-26,Muhammad Yunus faces criticism over 'press repression' in Bangladesh,"Michael Rubin, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and director of policy analysis at the Middle East Forum, has raised concerns about the trajectory of Bangladesh under the interim leadership of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus.

Rubin, in his recent article for 19FortyFive, suggested that Yunus, renowned for his pioneering work in microfinance, is now overseeing actions that suppress journalistic freedom and enable hardline Islamist groups such as Jamaat-e-Islami to exert influence over the nation's socio-political landscape.

Rubin drew parallels between Yunus's current actions and those of other Nobel laureates who, after receiving the prize, have been criticized for policies or actions that contradict the principles of peace and human rights.

He cited Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's involvement in the Tigray conflict and Aung San Suu Kyi's response to the Rohingya crisis as examples.

The article highlighted the persecution of journalists under Yunus's interim government. Freelancers Farzana Rupa and Shakil Ahmed have reportedly been imprisoned on baseless charges, with limited contact with their minor daughter.

Over 1,000 journalists ""deemed too secular"" have allegedly been dismissed, and prominent journalist Julfikar Ali Manik has become a target due to his focus on Islamist movements, he added.

Rubin also expressed concern over the treatment of Fazle Karim Chowdhury, a respected leader and advocate for human rights and minority protection.

Chowdhury's constituency, Raozan, has been a haven for Bangladesh's Hindu community, and his persecution raises alarms about the safety of minority groups under the current administration.

In light of these developments, Rubin called on the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to consider imposing Global Magnitsky Act sanctions on Muhammad Yunus, emphasizing that the Nobel Peace Prize should not serve as a shield for actions that undermine human rights and press freedom.

These observations are based on Michael Rubin's article in 19FortyFive. For a comprehensive understanding of the situation, readers are encouraged to consult multiple sources and perspectives. (ANI)"

Addressing an event, Ranil Wickremesinghe pointed out that it was essential for Sri Lanka to launch the Adani Group's renewable energy project.

""I met Indian PM Modi to discuss the Adani project. He inquired how much Sri Lanka can offer. As I am not an engineer or well-versed in this subject, I said we can offer between 25 to 50 GW. We could have earned a large sum of money through this project,"" he said.

Ranil Wickremesinghe said that apart from earning money, Sri Lanka could have easily secured more foreign investments.

""It is not good for us to lose this. If possible, we should offer more such projects through which Sri Lanka could monetarily benefit. Just because Adani invested, several more investors approached Sri Lanka,"" he said.

According to the Police, along with an increase in tourists driving three-wheelers in Sri Lanka, the rate of accidents involving such three-wheelers has also gone up.

Inquiries into these incidents have found that the tourists do not possess the necessary training or licences to drive three-wheelers.

As such, the Sri Lanka Police has announced that a tourist must carry either one of the following three documents when renting three-wheelers;

Stating that some three-wheeler rental companies are utilising the lack of proper documents to earn money, the Sri Lanka Police warned that legal action will be initiated for the failure to adhere to the new regulations.

In the event a tourist is found to be driving a three-wheeler without the essential licences, the Police have been authorized to record a statement from the owner of the three-wheeler and thereafter, file a case against them.

The Police further said that providing a three-wheeler to a person without a valid licence is a punishable offence, for which a fine of Rs. 25,000 can be imposed.

Companies providing three-wheelers on rentals to tourists have been urged to verify the necessary valid licences prior to renting out their vehicles. (Newswire)

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/26/uk-sanctions-wartime-president-mahinda-responds/,2025-03-26,UK sanctions : Wartime President Mahinda responds,"Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has categorically rejected the UK Government's allegation of widespread human rights violations during military operations at the time of Sri Lanka's civil war.

Issuing a statement, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said the recent sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, against Sri Lanka's former Chief of Defence Staff Shavendra Silva, former Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda and former Army Commander Jagath Jayasuriya are over unproven allegations of human rights violations during the war with the LTTE.

Mahinda Rajapaksa said that he, as the Executive President of Sri Lanka, took a decision to militarily defeat the LTTE, and the armed forces implemented that decision on the ground.

""Despite the 2002 ceasefire agreement, the LTTE had carried out 363 killings during the ceasefire between February 2002 and the end of September 2005. LTTE attacks intensified in the first few weeks and months after I was elected President in November 2005. Among the most serious such incidents were claymore mine attacks on 4 and 6 December 2005 in Jaffna that killed thirteen soldiers, a suicide attack on a naval craft on 5 January 2006 that killed 15 naval personnel, and the suicide attack on the Army Commander inside Army Headquarters in April 2006,"" he said.

The former President said, despite all that, his government held two rounds of peace talks in January and June 2006 in Geneva and Oslo, which were unilaterally halted by the LTTE.

""The LTTE landmine attack on a civilian bus in Kebithigollewa in June 2006, which killed 64 and seriously injured 86, many of them children, was a pivotal moment for me and my government. Military operations commenced in July 2006 when the LTTE closed the Mawilaru anicut, cutting off irrigation water to cultivators in the Trincomalee district and did not stop until the LTTE was completely defeated on 19 May 2009,"" he said.

The former President pointed out that Lord Naseby stated in the House of Lords on 12 October 2017 that the then UK Defence Attache in Colombo, Lieutenant Colonel Anton Gash, had in conversation with him, praised the discipline of the Sri Lanka army and stated that there certainly was no policy to kill civilians.

""Because Lt. Col Anton Gash's wartime dispatches to London differ so significantly from the narrative promoted by the UK political authorities, only a heavily redacted version of those dispatches has been released. We conducted military operations only against the LTTE and not against the Tamil people.

""Just months after the war ended, when my wartime army commander came forward as the opposition candidate at the 2010 presidential elections, the Tamil National Alliance issued a statement on 6 January 2010 appealing to the Tamil people to vote for the former army commander and he won over 60% of the votes cast in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, thus directly contradicting the narrative being promoted by the UK Government,"" he said.

Mahinda Rajapaksa noted that imposing sanctions on Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan, a.k.a Karuna Amman, who broke away from the LTTE in 2004 and later entered democratic politics, is a clear case of penalizing anti-LTTE Tamils so as to placate the dominant segment of the Tamil diaspora in the UK.

""When the UK foreign secretary David Milliband came to Sri Lanka in April 2009 and demanded a halt to military operations, I flatly turned him down. Later, a London-based newspaper, The Telegraph, revealed - quoting secret documents made public by Wikileaks - that Mr. Miliband had tried to intervene in Sri Lanka to win Tamil votes for the Labour Party. Regrettably, to this day, vote bank politics determines the UK's stand on Sri Lanka's war against the LTTE.

""Three decades of LTTE terrorism claimed the lives of 27,965 armed forces and police personnel, not to mention the lives of many thousands of civilians, including politicians. What Sri Lanka defeated in 2009 was the organization that the US Federal Bureau of Investigation had officially designated as the deadliest terrorist organization in the world. It is noteworthy that the United Kingdom introduced special legislation in 2021 and 2023 to protect its own armed forces from persecution by interested parties,"" he said.

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa further said that he expects the present government to resolutely stand by and defend former armed forces personnel who face persecution by foreign governments and organisations for doing their duty to safeguard Sri Lanka's national security. (Newswire)"

In this regard, the Ministry wishes to underline that this is a unilateral action taken by the UK government which involves an asset freeze and travel ban on the individuals concerned. Such unilateral actions by countries do not assist but serve to complicate the national reconciliation process underway in Sri Lanka.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/26/cbsl-keeps-overnight-policy-rate-unchanged/,2025-03-26,CBSL keeps Overnight Policy Rate unchanged,"The Monetary Policy Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has decided to keep the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 8.00%.

According to the CBSL, the Board arrived at this decision at its meeting held yesterday, after carefully considering the developments both domestically and globally.

The Monetary Policy Board remains confident that the prevailing monetary policy stance will ensure that inflation will move towards the target of 5% while supporting the growth of the domestic economy.

Inflation remains negative at present mainly due to repeated reductions in electricity tariffs and fuel prices. Deflationary conditions are expected to gradually ease from March 2025, with inflation projected to turn positive by mid-2025. Projections based on the currently available data suggest that inflation would reach the targeted levels by year-end.

The latest annual estimates revealed that the domestic economy recorded a strong recovery in 2024 after two years of contractions. Recent developments in the economy and leading indicators point towards a continuation of this momentum.

Rupee liquidity remains at a surplus level. Market interest rates have continued to decline in line with the eased monetary policy stance. Supported by low interest rates, credit flows to the private sector remained robust. This trend is expected to continue, encouraging domestic economic activity.

External sector performance has been more favourable than expected. Exports have remained strong, while imports have gained traction, causing the trade deficit to widen. Earnings from tourism and workers' remittances helped improve the external current account. Foreign inflows to the government securities market have risen recently, reflecting improved confidence. Increased net foreign purchases by the Central Bank and the receipt of the fourth tranche of the IMF-EFF programme helped increase official reserves, enhancing resilience. The Sri Lankan rupee saw a marginal depreciation thus far in 2025.

The CBSL further stated that risks to the inflation and growth outlook remain broadly in balance. However, the Board is watchful, among other things, of the possible impact of global trade and geopolitical uncertainties on the Sri Lankan economy. As such, monetary policy formulation will continue to be based on a forward-looking and data-dependent approach. The Board stands ready to respond to emerging risks to maintaining price stability while supporting the economy to reach its potential. (Newswire)"

Op-ed by IMF's Peter Breuer and Martha Tesfaye Woldemichael

This March marks the mid-point of Sri Lanka's four-year economic reform program supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

In the two years since its inception difficult but much needed reforms were undertaken with significant gains, thanks to the commitment and sacrifice of the people of Sri Lanka. Most noticeably, there are no more lines for fuel, cooking gas and medicines and no scheduled power outages. The economy has rebounded strongly and quickly--it grew 5 percent in 2024 and in a mere 18 months recovered just under half of the output lost from the peak in 2018 to the nadir in 2023. Skyrocketing inflation has been halted. Tax revenues as a share of GDP are up by more than two thirds and the government's balance excluding interest payments (primary balance) has improved by nearly 6 percentage points. The macroeconomic turnaround is remarkable even as many households are yet to feel the impact.

The debt relief provided by external creditors has reduced the burden the Sri Lankan people need to shoulder. External creditors have forgiven $3 billion in debt and stretched another $25 billion due in the near term or already overdue over a much longer time horizon over the next 20 years with much reduced interest rates. Sri Lanka's tradeable debt instruments are once again attractive to investors as they have been included in international bond indices and Sri Lanka's credit rating was upgraded by at least 3 notches.

Markets have rewarded Sri Lanka's reforms with sharp declines in domestic borrowing cost from a peak of 30 percent in 2023 to currently 8 percent and in the sovereign risk ""spread"" indicator in international markets from a peak of 70 percent to 5 percent. Responsible international market access should be within reach in the next few years.

The Sri Lankan people are paying a regrettably high price for past policy missteps and insufficient preparation for the bad luck that struck. Unsustainably low taxes and sizeable tax exemptions largely benefitting enterprises rather than people were an accident waiting to happen. The flipside of the government's enhanced ability to fund its essential services today is that taxpayers have had to shoulder a higher burden, even as they are asked to contribute commensurate with their income and wealth. Similarly, the full cost of fuel and electricity is now borne by their users without subsidies by the government, allowing scarce public resources to be directed to priority areas such as social protection. These sacrifices are needed to ensure that Sri Lanka can extricate itself fully from its still very vulnerable position and prevent a return of the calamitous conditions experienced in 2022.

IMF financing since 2023 has helped avoid more dire outcomes than what Sri Lankans witnessed in 2022 before the program began. The IMF-supported economic program continues to provide a credible framework for committing to reforms that catalyze financing from other multilateral and bilateral partners. It assured creditors that the debt relief they granted would allow Sri Lanka to service the remaining debt after the restructuring.

After elections last fall, the IMF swiftly engaged closely with the new government to recalibrate the program to help the authorities fulfill some of their policy priorities. Thanks to successful revenue mobilization efforts, it was possible for the government to provide some relief to the people of Sri Lanka under the program and in a way that preserved the government's ability to provide other essential services. The personal income tax regime was adjusted, public sector wages are being raised to partially compensate for past high inflation, and some relief was provided to users of dairy products.

At this mid-point mark, it is important to continue with the reforms and avoid the mistakes of the past. About half of IMF programs Sri Lanka has had prior to the current one, ended prematurely, often followed by economic underperformance. It is important to arrest this boom-bust cycle and manage the economy so that the recovery can be sustained even in an uncertain global environment and so that all Sri Lankans benefit from it.

The path to stable and inclusive growth and fiscal and debt sustainability remains narrow. There is no room for policy errors. It will be important to continue to deliver revenues needed for essential government services, including by limiting tax exemptions. Scarce public resources need to be protected by restoring cost-recovery pricing for fuel and electricity and ensuring social support is well-targeted towards the most disadvantaged. The poor and vulnerable need to be given the opportunity to adequately participate in the economic turnaround. To unlock Sri Lanka's long-term potential, capital spending in support of medium-term growth should be executed more predictably.

The task ahead is ambitious but doable. Keeping the reform momentum going will be key for a full recovery, benefitting not only this generation but future ones as well. The IMF will remain a steadfast partner to support Sri Lanka in securing a strong and durable recovery improving the lives and livelihoods of all citizens.

In a post on Facebook, Ali Sabry pointed out that in 2023, 52% of Sri Lanka's electricity came from Thermal power burning oil and coal, stating that it was at a staggering cost of Rs. 407.5 billion, which was 87% of the total generation cost.

He went on to note that 48% of the electricity generated through renewable energy, such as large-hydro, solar, wind, and small-hydro, was received at a cost of Rs. 63.1 billion, which was only 13% of the total cost.

""Almost half the electricity at a fraction of the cost. Yet, policies are being introduced that disincentivise rooftop solar, such as drastically reducing the tariff paid for solar units. Who does that help?"" he questioned.

Ali Sabry pointed out that this move benefits only the Diesel Mafia, those who profit from Sri Lanka's dependency on imported fossil fuels.

He further urged the government to consider holding back on their reduction until thermal power is phased out, which he hinted was a long way to go.

Stating whether the government was serious about reducing electricity bills, building energy independence, and protecting the environment, the former minister made the following three key suggestions

Emphasizing that this was not just an energy issue, but a national issue, Ali Sabry said if the government was truly national-minded, it would stand with low-cost, clean energy.

""You stand with the people. You stand against vested interests that profit from crisis and dependency. Let's make choices that empower the nation, not a few,"" he added. (Newswire)


* Promote rooftop solar, not punish those who invest in it.
* Encourage more private investment in wind, solar, and small hydro.

AdFest 2025, held at the renowned Royal Cliff Hotels Group's PEACH convention center in Pattaya, Thailand, was nothing short of inspiring. The event, running from March 20 to 22, brought together 700+ advertising professionals from 55 cities around the globe under the theme ""COLLiDE,"" symbolizing the convergence of diverse ideas, cultures, and innovations.

This time there were 48 delegates from Sri Lanka and AdFest provided a significant platform not only to represent our nation's creativity but also to engage deeply with the vibrant pulse of global advertising trends. We were proud to see Janidu and Shakil crowned as Young Lotus Sri Lanka 2025 winners, representing our creative community on an international stage while one of the campaigns from Ogilvy Sri Lanka winning a Bronze award in the Sustainable Lotus category for the campaign that they did for Promate.

Among the numerous insightful sessions, One of the most compelling sessions was ""Creative Expression of Cultural Collision"" by Seiya Matsumiya and Erik Reiff from Black Cat White Cat Music, Tokyo. This session explored how cultural collisions can elevate artistic expression and drive innovation through unexpected collaborations. It was fascinating to see how diverse influences can lead to impactful and resonant works, especially in the context of musical projects.

Christian Greet from Cirkus in Auckland delivered ""Artificial Insanity,"" a vital session that navigated the complexities of generative AI in advertising. He shed light on user frustrations, artistic fears, and corporate promises, offering a balanced perspective on whether AI is a devil or a messiah in our industry. Understanding this is critical for us in Sri Lanka as we begin to integrate AI into our creative processes.

Another session that stood out was ""A Creative, A Gaming Expert and A Strategist Agree to Disagree"" featuring Nicole Ingra, Rey Tiempo, and Felipe Franco. This high-energy session showcased how creative friction can fuel innovation and lead to groundbreaking work. The panelists demonstrated how navigating industry clashes can result in unexpected breakthroughs, highlighting the importance of embracing debate as a catalyst for creativity.

David Guerrero (BBDO Guerrero, Manila), Nick Wood (Syn Music, Tokyo), and Arthur Tsang (BBDO Greater China, Shanghai) presented ""The Collision of Sound & Vision."" This immersive session explored how music enhances sensory experiences and brand perception. The promise of a curated musical playlist during lunch to enhance the taste of the food was particularly intriguing! It highlighted the often-overlooked power of sound in advertising and brand storytelling.

The festival's Lotus Awards further amplified the celebratory atmosphere, introducing an elegant, newly designed trophy, symbolizing the fusion of innovation and tradition--a fitting tribute to outstanding creative achievements across the region.

Beyond structured sessions, informal networking moments allowed Sri Lankan delegates valuable exchanges, fostering potential collaborations and igniting fresh ideas to bring back home.

In reflection, AdFest 2025 was more than an advertising festival; it was a celebration of global/ regional creativity and collaboration. As Sri Lankan delegates, we return inspired and energized, ready to elevate our local industry with renewed perspectives and collaborative spirits."

The test, conducted under the country's anti-terrorism laws, began on Monday morning and has extended into Tuesday.

Facebook users in the country have been unable to log-in to the platform and it is unclear how long the ban will go on for.

The government's move was not flagged ahead of the ""test"" on Monday -- a move opposition MPs and media leaders have described as ""tyranny"" and an ""abuse of human rights"".

In a statement, PNG's Police Minister Peter Tsiamalili said the initiative was to ensure ""responsible usage"" of social media platforms like Facebook while keeping ""harmful content"" out of public discourse.

""However, the unchecked proliferation of fake news, hate speech, pornography, child exploitation, and incitement to violence on platforms such as Facebook is unacceptable.

""These challenges increasingly threaten the safety, dignity, and well-being of our populace.""

Facebook is by far the most popular social media platform in the country, with an estimated 1.3 million users, or about half of the country's estimated 2.6 million internet users.

In comparison, Instagram has about 106,000 users.

The platform is a critical tool for public discourse in the country, with many highly active forums used to discuss PNG politics and social issues.

Yet, the government has been highly critical of Facebook with the platform often blamed for helping spread misinformation, particularly in light of a recent spate of tribal killings in the country.

It has long threatened a move against Facebook, after announcing a parliamentary inquiry into ""media disinformation"" in 2023.

Meta, Facebook's parent company, has been contacted for comment. (ABC)"

Issuing a statement, Wasantha Karannagoda said these sanctions are not about justice but are a direct result of international political maneuvering.

""These sanctions are not based on any transparent investigation or legal proceedings. Instead, they reflect the selective application of international pressure, targeting those who played key roles in Sri Lanka's military victory,"" he said.

The comments come after the UK Government recently imposed sanctions on former head of the Sri Lankan Armed Forces Shavendra Silva, former Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda, former Commander of the Sri Lankan Army Jagath Jayasuriya and former LTTE military commander Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias Karuna Amman.

Announcing the sanctions, the UK Government said it was imposed for serious human rights abuses and violations during the Sri Lanka civil war; including extrajudicial killings, torture and/or perpetration of sexual violence.

Responding to the sanctions, former Navy Commander, Admiral of the Fleet Wasantha Karannagoda issued the following statement:

For decades, I have served Sri Lanka with unwavering dedication, committed to protecting our sovereignty and ensuring the safety of our people. I have stood firm in the face of challenges--whether on the battlefield, in matters of national security, or in defending our country against external interference. However, today, I find myself facing unjust sanctions imposed by the United Kingdom, alongside General Jagath Jayasuriya,  GeneralShavendra de Silva. These sanctions are not about justice but are a direct result of international political maneuvering.

It was War Against Terrorism: A Fight for Survival

Sri Lanka did not seek war, but we had no choice when terrorism threatened to dismantle our nation. The LTTE, one of the most ruthless terrorist organizations in the world, carried out massacres, assassinations, and suicide bombings, terrorizing innocent civilians for decades. While the international community remained passive, it was the Sri Lankan Armed Forces that made the difficult decision to put an end to this brutality.

I take pride in the role I played as Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy, ensuring that the LTTE's international supply routes were destroyed. Without weapons, ammunition, and external support, their ability to continue fighting was significantly weakened. The decisive actions of the Navy, alongside the Army and Air Force, led to the eventual defeat of terrorism and the restoration of peace in Sri Lanka.

Selective Targeting and International Hypocrisy

These sanctions are not based on any transparent investigation or legal proceedings. Instead, they reflect the selective application of international pressure, targeting those who played key roles in Sri Lanka's military victory. The same foreign entities that now impose restrictions did nothing while Sri Lanka was under siege by terrorists. They ignored the atrocities committed by the LTTE, but now demand accountability from those who risked their lives to end a war that claimed thousands of innocent lives.

This double standard raises a critical question: Is this truly about human rights, or is it about political influence?

Sri Lanka's challenges did not end with the defeat of terrorism. There have been numerous internal and external attempts to destabilize the country, often with foreign involvement. As someone who has always prioritized the security of this nation, I am well aware of the forces that have worked against our national interests. These include individuals who have misused their positions of power, collaborated with external actors, and sought to manipulate political outcomes for personal gain.

The events of May 9, 2022, serve as a stark reminder of how internal betrayal and foreign interference can converge to create chaos. If not for the swift and decisive actions of the Sri Lanka Navy and Air Force that night, the country's leadership and future would have been drastically altered. While others plotted, it was the dedication of our military personnel that prevented a complete breakdown of order.

Despite these challenges, I remain committed to Sri Lanka. I have always placed my country above personal ambition, and I will continue to do so. No foreign government, no politically motivated sanction, and no internal betrayal can change my unwavering belief in this nation's strength.

The people of Sri Lanka know the truth. They lived through the war, they witnessed the sacrifices made, and they understand who truly stood for the country in its time of need. These sanctions will not define my legacy or the legacy of those who genuinely defended this nation.

Sri Lanka has overcome greater challenges before, and we will do so again. As a nation, we must remain vigilant, united, and steadfast against all forces--both foreign and domestic--that seek to weaken us. (Newswire)"

Stating that this report cannot be considered a fully accurate report, he said more censuses need to be conducted in the future.

""There is no programme for the management of wild animals. The Wildlife Department is tasked with protecting animals and not managing them. To manage wild animals, a census must be conducted. For example, Australia is aware of its Kangaroo population because of a census conducted in this regard. However, in Sri Lanka, we are unaware of our monkey population. So it is essential to collect at least a rough count,"" he said.

Minister Lal Kantha further said that an animal census will help determine whether to manage the wild animal population or to provide them to foreign countries.

""Through this, we can achieve a scientific solution. Up to date, no such measure had been taken. However, we have commenced this initiative. The initial step may not fulfill all requirements. We also would not be able to calculate the exact population. But we can ascertain an estimated number. Based on this, we can take necessary measures to manage wild animals,"" he added.

Sri Lanka conducted a nationwide census on 15 March to identify crop-damaging animals affecting the agricultural sector.

The public was given a five-minute window, from 8:00 a.m. to 8:05 a.m., to count these animals on their properties using a designated form.

Per the Gazette notification, the maximum retail price of a medicine should be determined based on the following factors;

-Duties and Taxes

-The supply chain total markup

According to the new pricing mechanism, the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of a medicine is to be determined by considering the exchange rate of the US Dollar based on the average value of the past three months as published by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

The Gazette authorizes the  National Medicine Regulatory Authority of Sri Lanka (NMRA) to review the Maximum Retail Price twice a year.

The NMRA is vested with the power to revise the Maximum Retail Price of medicines if it considers it necessary in the public interest and if there is a fluctuation of the exchange rate beyond an accepted tolerance level.

When determining the Maximum Ceiling Price of medicines, retail prices across different pharmacies and the market shares of different brands and generics are to be considered using a statistical method involving median retail price.

The Gazette further specifies that medicines cannot be sold above the Maximum Ceiling Price.

Accordingly, if the Maximum Retail Price of a medicine is lower than the Maximum Ceiling Price, it cannot be increased.

For newly registered medicines, if the Maximum Retail Price exceeds the Maximum Ceiling Price, then the Maximum Ceiling Price is to be adopted as the retail price.

The NMRA is authorised to revise Maximum Retail Prices and Maximum Ceiling Prices based on market conditions to improve access to medicines.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/27/new-words-added-to-oxford-english-dictionary/,2025-03-27,New words added to Oxford English Dictionary,"Words including ""class"" and ""spice bag"" have been added to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) in its latest update.

A number of new words including eight Hiberno-English/Irish-English words have been added to mark popular words and phrases.

The OED said it wanted to incorporate ""loan words"" - words that would be coined as ""untranslatable"" but are used with enough frequency by people who speak English alongside other languages that they have become part of ""the vocabulary of their variety of English"".

The new additions for the first quarter of 2025 are from Ireland, southeast Asia and South Africa, BBC reported.

Much has been written about so-called 'untranslatable words'--words and phrases in one language that cannot be translated into another. Of course, no word is entirely untranslatable, especially in the hands of a skilled translator, who can use various strategies to express something from a source language that has no direct equivalent in the target language. Often, when we talk about untranslatable words, what we are actually talking about are words that have been lexicalized in one language but not in others, which is what makes them particularly intriguing. After all, wouldn't it be useful for English speakers to have a specific word for sunlight dappling through leaves, just like speakers of Japanese do? Or a particular word for the action of sitting outside enjoying a beer, like the one Norwegians have?

For people who speak English alongside other languages, there is an easy way to fill such a lexical gap--simply borrowing the untranslatable word from another language. Sometimes, they do this with enough frequency that the borrowed word eventually becomes part of the vocabulary of their variety of English. A few examples of such loan words are featured in this quarter's OED update, which includes new additions from Southeast Asia, South Africa, and Ireland.

A word that appears regularly on lists of untranslatable words is gigil. Originally from Tagalog but now also used in Philippine English (dating back to 1990 according to OED evidence), gigil is a feeling we get when we see someone or something cute, a feeling so intense that it gives us the irresistible urge to tightly clench our hands, grit our teeth, and pinch or squeeze whomever or whatever it is we find so adorable, whether it be a chubby-cheeked baby or a fluffy little kitten. Gigil is a pithy name for such a strange, paradoxical emotion, and apart from its use as a noun, it can also be employed as an adjective to describe the person experiencing it. So, if a Filipino says they're gigil, they're just dealing with overwhelming feelings (usually positive).

A much earlier borrowing from Tagalog among this set of new Philippine English words is salakot (first attested 1841), a type of lightweight Filipino hat that is typically domed or conical in shape, with a wide brim, and often has a spiked or ornamental finial at the tip of the crown. Commonly worn by farmers as protection against the weather, the hat has become an important symbol of Filipino culture and is now also worn as part of traditional Filipino attire during festivals and other celebrations. The salakot's iconic shape is mirrored by the kababayan (2002), a small, sweet, typically yellow cake similar to a muffin, which can be found in most Filipino neighbourhood bakeries. Kababayan (1915)is also a word that Filipinos use to call their fellow Filipinos, or people who come from the same Philippine region or town as them. The word combines the Tagalog prefix ka-, expressing companionship, with -babayan, a variant with reduplicated first syllable of the noun bayan, meaning 'town' or 'country'.

Lumpia (1924)is another English word borrowed from Tagalog, but also from Malay, from Indonesian, and perhaps even Dutch. It is the name of any of various types of East and Southeast Asian spring rolls, typically consisting of a very thin pancake filled with minced meat, seafood, or vegetables, rolled into a cylinder, sometimes deep-fried, and served with a dipping sauce. The Southeast Asian word comes from the Hokkien word lūn-pián, from lūn 'smooth, moist' and pián 'flat round cake'. In its variant form loempia, it could have been borrowed into English via Dutch loempia, or it could just be reflecting a form of the Malay word with Dutch-based spelling.

A staple of Filipino parties at home and abroad is singing. Filipinos are known the world over for their vocal prowess, but even those who have not been blessed with the national talent are welcome to participate in the national pastime of videoke (1990), the Filipino version of karaoke. During sweltering summers in the Philippines, they can do so more comfortably while wearing a sando (1943), a sleeveless garment worn under or instead of a shirt.

Other Philippine English entries in this update are not loan words, but idiosyncratic uses of existing English words. In the Philippines, load (2003) is credit purchased for a pay-as-you-go mobile phone; CR (1987), short for comfort room, is a toilet; and a terror (1967)teacher is one who is strict, harsh, or demanding.

The last new entry in this update is of significance to the history of Philippine English. A Thomasite (1908) was an American teacher in the Philippines during the period of American occupation from 1899 to 1946. The first group of over 500 schoolteachers arrived in Manila on 21 August 1901 on the U.S. Army Transport Thomas, hence the name they were later collectively given. The Thomasites were tasked with establishing a new public school system, teaching basic education, and training Filipino teachers using English as the primary language of instruction, thereby, for good or ill, helping transform the Philippines into the Anglophone country it is today.

A category of words that often defy direct translation are exclamations that express different emotions. An example of such an interjection is alamak (earliest seen 1952), one of the new words from Malaysia and Singapore included in this update. Borrowed from Malay, this colloquial exclamation is used to convey surprise, shock, dismay, or outrage. The word's ultimate origin is uncertain; it could have come from ala 'highest, exalted', from the Arabic aʿlā 'higher, highest' or Allah 'god', from Arabic allāh, combined with mak 'mother', perhaps originally after the Portuguese expression Mãe de Deus, literally 'Mother of God', Santa Mãe, literally 'Holy Mother', or another similar utterance. A comparable interjection, alamah, is used in Kristang, a Malay-Portuguese creole language.

The names of local dishes also tend to be borrowed into English rather than given an Anglicized name. A few examples of Malay food terms are included in this quarterly update. Ketupat (1886) is a small rice cake boiled in a pouch of woven palm leaves, originating in Indonesia but also popular in Brunei, Malaysia, and Singapore. Ketupat made with rice is wrapped in a diamond shape with woven coconut palm leaves, while a version made with glutinous rice is wrapped in a triangle shape with woven fan palm leaves. It is usually eaten with satay or other dishes and is traditionally served at festive occasions.

Otak-otak (1929) is a Southeast Asian dish consisting of ground fish or other seafood mixed with spices and coconut milk, wrapped in banana or palm leaves, and cooked by steaming or grilling over an open charcoal fire. It is usually served as an accompaniment to nasi lemak (1935), a Malay dish of rice cooked in coconut milk and flavoured with pandan leaf, served with various garnishes such as cucumber slices, fried fish, roasted peanuts, cooked egg, and sambal. It is usually eaten for breakfast, just like kaya toast (1989), a sandwich consisting of two slices of toasted bread spread with butter and kaya, a jam made from coconut milk, eggs, and sugar, usually flavoured with pandan leaf. Kaya toast is also a popular afternoon snack, typically served in Malaysian and Singaporean kopitiams, accompanied by a half-boiled egg (1931), an egg which has been cooked briefly in freshly boiled water such that the yolk and the white remain runny, then cracked open and served in a bowl, seasoned with dark soy sauce and white pepper.

Two examples of Malay dishes that did get Anglicized names are fish head curry (1972) and steamboat (1960). Fish head curry is a dish influenced by Chinese and South Indian cuisine, consisting of a large fish head, usually of a sea bream or snapper, cooked in a tangy tamarind-based curry gravy with vegetables such as aubergine and okra. Steamboat is a dish consisting of thinly sliced meat, vegetables, etc., dipped in boiling stock by the diner at the table. The word was first used to indicate a metal pot, often with a central flue, placed over a heat source at the table, used for cooking and serving the dish.

All this talk of food might inspire one to get a takeaway, or to tapau (1997), as they say in Malaysian English and Singapore English. Tapau comes from the Malay word and its Cantonese etymon dá bāau 'to pack, to pack up food to take away', which is from dá 'to beat, to tie or do up', combined with bāau 'to wrap, to package'.

In Malaysia, a mat rempit (2004) is a (typically young) man who participates in illegal motorcycle street racing and often performs dangerous stunts. They can be described as terror--as in Philippine English, in Malaysian English terror can also be used as an adjective. In Singapore and Malaysia, terror can mean 'terrible' or 'awful' (1977), but it can also be a general term of approval meaning 'admirable, excellent' (1997). Terror is frequently preceded by wah and followed by lah, as in this approving 2020 social media post quoted in the OED entry: 'Wah! So terror lah.'

Some of South Africa's many languages have contributed various loan words to this quarterly update. The interjection yoh, which the OED was able to trace to 1855, comes from two of them: it is an imitative utterance that is probably after the Afrikaans jo and the Xhosa yho or yo. Yoh in South African English is a cry or exclamation used to express various emotions or reactions, such as surprise, wonder, admiration, shock, or distress.

Also from Afrikaans are two expressions that relate to feelings of frustration and anger. The adjective gatvol (first attested 1980) is a South African slang term describing a person who has had enough; one who is extremely annoyed, unhappy, or bored, especially with a state of affairs that has persisted for a long time. The hell-in (1966) is a colloquial phrase that is used predicatively to talk about someone who is furious or fed up. It is modelled after the Afrikaans phrase die hel in, which literally translates to 'in the hell'--in Afrikaans, it is grammatical for the preposition in to be in final position, so that syntactic characteristic was borrowed into English along with the meaning.

Tjoekie (1977) is a similarly colloquial term for prison or jail. It was introduced into South Africa by English-speaking immigrants from India, but it made its way into South African English via Afrikaans. It is related to an earlier slang term for word jail, chokey, a variant of chowki, which traces its roots back to Hindi, and ultimately, Sanskrit.

Seshweshwe (1956) and shweshwe (1973) are borrowings from Southern Sotho referring to a type of printed cotton fabric, originally dyed with indigo but now available in various colours, featuring intricate, usually geometric, patterns and typically used for traditional Southern African clothes or accessories.

A makarapa (1999) was originally a hard hat worn by a miner or construction worker, but it is now more known for its use by sports fans, especially football fans, who paint and elaborately decorate these hats with flags, horns, and badges and wear them at games to show support for their favourite teams. The word comes from a Bantu language of South Africa, although the exact donor language has not been identified. Similar words meaning 'hard hat' or 'helmet' exist in Tswana (makarapa, plural of lekarapa) and Fanagalo (makalapa, apparently singular). Other comparable words include Tswana lekarapa 'miner' and Northern Sotho lekarapa '(returned) migrant worker, especially a miner', both with the plural form makarapa.

Of unknown origin is zol, the South African colloquial term for marijuana, which can be used to refer to the intoxicating and hallucinogenic drug prepared from the marijuana plant (recorded earliest in 1946), as well as to a hand-rolled cigarette containing marijuana (1949). Another informal South African word whose origin is uncertain is the adjective moggy (1984), applied to a person who is extremely irrational or out of touch with reality; to go moggy is to lose control of one's emotions or behaviour.

Finally, sharp-sharp is a casual way to say hello or goodbye in South African English (1991), and also a way to compliment someone's style or just to comment on how generally excellent or fantastic they are (2018).

Irish is another language from which English has borrowed a wealth of new words, with one of them being added to the OED in this update. Ludraman, from Irish liúdramán or lúdramán, is a colloquial and derogatory term for a lazy, unproductive, or stupid person. The earliest evidence of this word's use in English is in James Joyce's seminal 1922 novel Ulysses, in which the author spells it loodheramaun, one of the eleven different spellings for the word recorded in the OED.

Also included in this batch of new Irish English words is blaa (earliest seen 1960), the name of a soft white bread roll dusted with flour that is particularly associated with Waterford, Ireland. This type of bread roll is usually thought to have been introduced to Waterford by Huguenot immigrants in the 17th century, though its exact history is difficult to determine. Possible origins could be the French words blanc 'white' and blé 'wheat', but neither of these suggestions can be substantiated.

Class is how main character Erin describes her hometown of Derry, Northern Ireland in an episode of the first season of the popular sitcom Derry Girls. Creator Lisa McGee's 2018 script is quoted in the OED's entry for the Irish and northern English usage of class as a general term of approval, which the dictionary dates back to 1981. Another usage that Irish English shares with other varieties of English is the use of mineral to mean a carbonated soft drink (1893). While still current in Irish English and West African English, this sense of mineral is now apparently unusual in British English, except as a commercial designation for soft drinks of this type.

The debs (1980), short for debs' ball, is a formal social event held for students in their final year of secondary school, usually towards the end of the school year. The debs is an important rite of passage for Irish teenagers, who are careful not to act the maggot (1946)--behave foolishly--lest they end up feeling morto (1991)--extremely embarrassed.

These days, any good night out in Ireland is best concluded by going to a Chinese food outlet or fish and chip shop to get a spice bag. This is a takeaway meal typically consisting of chips, shredded deep-fried chicken, fried onions, red and green peppers, chilli peppers, and jalapeño peppers, tossed together in a bag with various spices and often served with curry sauce for dipping. The spice bag was invented in a Chinese takeaway restaurant in Dublin called Sunflower around 2006, and indeed the OED's first quotation for this entry is a social media post from 2012 of someone contemplating a trip to Sunflower to grab one.

An Irish creation inspired by Chinese cuisine, with Mexican and Indian elements that all somehow work together to form a delicious whole, the spice bag is not unlike the World Englishes whose diverse vocabulary we discuss in these quarterly updates to the OED--absorbing novel expressions from various languages and cultures, introducing new connotations and usage patterns to the lexicon, ensuring that English speakers have just the right words to say what they want to say.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/27/global-car-industry-faces-turmoil-as-trump-announces-new-tax/,2025-03-27,Global Car Industry faces turmoil as Trump announces new Tax,"US Donald Trump announced plans to impose sweeping 25% tariffs on cars from overseas on Wednesday, days before the US president is expected to announce wide-ranging levies on other goods from around the world.

""What we're going to be doing is a 25% tariff for all cars that are not made in the United States,"" Trump said in the Oval Office. ""We start off with a 2.5% base, which is what we're at, and go to 25%.""

The tariffs will go into effect next week, on 2 April, the president claimed, and the US will start collecting them the following day. ""This is very exciting,"" he said, suggesting the move would spur economic growth.

In February, Trump floated the idea of a 25% tariff on imported vehicles but had offered no other details. On Monday, the president hinted that the auto industry levies could come in ""the very near future"".

On 2 April - a day Trump has dubbed ""liberation day"" - the president is expected to unveil a wide range of so-called reciprocal tariffs - levies on imported goods that the Trump administration argues are unfairly taxed by the US's trading partners.

Trump has long argued that the US is being cheated by its trading partners and that tariffs are the best remedy. However, he has delayed or watered down his tariff plans on several occasions. His stance has worried investors, leading to sharp sell-offs in US stock markets, and has proved unpopular with both corporate America and consumers.

Many economists have expressed alarm, too, warning that the president's tariff plan would risk increasing prices across the US. A study by Anderson Economic Group, an automotive consultant, for example, found that blanket tariffs on Canada and Mexico risked increasing US car prices by as much as $12,000.

Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Canada and Germany are among the top car exporters to the US. Will Scharf, a White House official, claimed the new car tariffs would result in more than $100bn in annual revenue to the US.

The announcement drew swift condemnation from the European Union and from Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, who called it a ""direct attack"" on Canadian workers.

""We will defend our workers, we will defend our companies, we will defend our country, and we will defend it together,"" Carney said.

Shares of automakers fell in after-hours trading and US equity index futures slid, indicating stocks were headed for a lower open on Thursday.

""Have no fear, we will WIN everything!!!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social earlier this month, claiming that tariffs were already ""pouring money"" into the country.

But a Harris poll conducted for the Guardian found that the majority of Americans were already worried about the impact tariffs will have on their finances. Ninety per cent of Democrats, 69% of independents and 57% of Republicans reported they were concerned about tariffs.

Industry groups sounded the alarm on Wednesday. ""Throwing away tens of thousands of jobs on both sides of the border will mean giving up North America's auto leadership role, instead encouraging companies to build and hire anywhere else but here,"" said Candace Laing, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. ""This tax hike puts plants and workers at risk for generations, if not forever.""  (The Guardian)"

The iconic Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club, one of Sri Lanka's oldest and most prestigious sporting institutions, has announced the launch of its 125th anniversary celebrations. Founded on December 2, 1899, the Club marked the significant milestone with a special press conference held at its home ground, the legendary P. Saravanamuttu Stadium recently.

Tamil Union's 125-year journey represents an important chapter in the country's sporting history. Officials unveiled the commemorative anniversary logo and comprehensive calendar of activities designed to honour its rich heritage and contributions to Sri Lankan cricket and the nation's sporting arena.

The historic club, which has been integral to the development of the sport, will host various tournaments, heritage exhibitions, and community outreach programs throughout the year. These events will bring together past and present members, cricket personalities, and the wider Sri Lankan community to celebrate this unique achievement in the club's storied history.

Recognised as the Home of Cricket in Sri Lanka, the historic club is deeply intertwined with the nation's cricketing journey on the world stage. Built in 1943, the P. Saravanamuttu Stadium was Sri Lanka's first stadium of its kind. Notably, Sri Lanka's inaugural Test match against England was held at the P. Saravanamuttu Stadium in February 1982.

The grounds also holds the distinction of being the only venue outside Australia and England where the legendary Sir Donald Bradman played cricket. The stadium also was the venue for the country's first Test victory.

Throughout its history, Tamil Union has been instrumental in developing cricketing talent from diverse backgrounds. The Club's most momentous ambassador is spin bowling maestro Muttiah Muralitharan, who claimed a record 800 Test wickets in 133 matches, making him the leading wicket-taker in international cricket history.

Memorably, M. Sathasivam, one of Sri Lanka's greatest batsmen, was produced by the Club. He first played for Ceylon in 1945, scoring a glorious 111 runs against India. In 1948, he captained Sri Lanka against Don Bradman's Australia. His best and final century in the island came in 1955, when he scored 206 not out for the 'Rest' team against Government Services at the Nondescript Cricket Club grounds in Colombo.

Tamil Union's sporting excellence extends beyond cricket. The Club has a distinguished history in hockey, producing A. Mylvaganam, widely considered Sri Lanka's greatest hockey player and adage 'The Hockey Wizard'. Mylvaganam represented Ceylon in numerous international tournaments and was renowned for his exceptional stick work and strategic gameplay that elevated the nation's hockey standing on the world stage.

Ramesh Schaffter, President of Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club, said, ""For 125 years, Tamil Union has been at the heart of Sri Lankan cricket, witnessing and contributing to many historic moments that have shaped our national sporting identity. During this anniversary we will pay tribute to the countless individuals who have shaped our legacy, celebrate the past and also recommit ourselves to nurturing cricket talent and set the foundation for our next century of sporting excellence.""

Beyond cricket, Tamil Union offers a wide range of sporting facilities including swimming, badminton, squash, tennis, and a fully equipped gymnasium. The Club also serves as Sri Lanka Cricket's center for women's cricket, providing the national women's team with training facilities and infrastructure. Also, it functions as a vibrant social club as well, featuring well-stocked refreshments, an excellent kitchen serving varied cuisine, and hosts numerous social activities that bring members together throughout the year.

The Industries Minister was addressing an event organized by the Regional Development Bank.

""Debt can be like certain girls,"" quipped Minister Handunnetti, drawing a comparison between bad debt and what he described as the behaviour of certain women. He claimed that banks often forget the good deeds of their customers, much like how, in his analogy, past kindnesses are overlooked.

""Bank officials must not take offence,"" he said. ""Not all banks behave this way, but when a customer faces difficulty, banks often bring up historical data, letters, and past commitments, disregarding earlier repayments, deposits, and sacrifices.""

The Minister said the situation was comparable to certain personal relationships, where previous goodwill is overlooked, and threats or ultimatums follow. ""March 31 is a day like that,"" he added, referencing fears among borrowers of asset seizures.

Handunneththi stressed the need for strong relationships between banks and borrowers, likening it to a long-term commitment: ""If the connection is there, it can be permanent.""

Highlighting the ongoing debt challenges, particularly for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) following the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis, the Minister said the government has recognized these issues and initiated discussions with banks to explore solutions.

He urged struggling enterprises to begin talks with banks immediately. ""If we fail to reach agreements even after December, the banks will also be compelled to make decisions,"" he said. (Newswire)

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/28/tisl-welcomes-imf-structural-benchmark-on-asset-declarations/,2025-03-28,TISL welcomes IMF structural benchmark on Asset Declarations,"Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) has welcomed the introduction of a new Structural Benchmark in the IMF's Third Review Agreement, which it states addressed gaps in implementing the Asset Declarations system under the Anti-Corruption Act of 2023.

Issuing a statement, TISL said this is a significant step toward ensuring public access to asset declarations, a long-standing reform for which it has strongly advocated.

The benchmark requires the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) to remove excessive redactions, disclose bank balances and other asset values, improve accessibility, publish non-filers' names, include Beneficial Ownership details in declaration forms, and enact a comprehensive Asset Recovery Law in line with UNCAC obligations.

While this progress is welcome, TISL said it highlights a broader concern, as government institutions often prioritize procedural compliance over meaningful reform.

Weak governance and corruption were key contributors to Sri Lanka's economic collapse, yet accountability remains lacking when governance-related commitments are not effectively implemented. Critical transparency and anti-corruption reforms risk being delayed or diluted without structured oversight and meaningful public engagement.

Pointing out that without genuine public participation, governance reforms risk becoming ineffective, TISL has called on the government to establish a structured, transparent mechanism for civil society engagement in governance reforms, particularly within International Financial Institution led programs such as the IMF agreement.

This mechanism must go beyond ad-hoc consultations and ensure that reforms are developed, implemented, and monitored with input from the public and civil society organizations, reflecting real-world challenges and needs. An open, participatory approach will not only strengthen reform outcomes but also build public trust in the process, it said.

TISL further urged International Financial Institutions to institutionalize civil society participation, ensuring governance reforms are not reduced to box-ticking exercises. Just as macroeconomic targets are rigorously assessed, governance commitments must be subject to the same level of scrutiny.

Upcoming reforms on proceeds of crime, public procurement, and beneficial ownership transparency must be implemented in ways that guarantee genuine progress. TISL emphasized that the strength of Sri Lanka's economic recovery will not be determined by financial restructuring alone but by its commitment to accountability, open governance, and the rule of law.

This conference was hosted by Verite Research with the support of the High Commission of India in Colombo and Hayleys Advantis.

According to the Indian High Commission, the day-long conference in its three sessions explored how Sri Lanka can strategically leverage its proximity and connectivity to India, an emerging global economic powerhouse, to enhance exports, attract investments, and drive sustainable economic recovery.

Setting the stage, Deputy High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka, Dr. Satyanjal Pandey, delivered the welcome remarks highlighting how India's multi-sectoral advancements can contribute to regional prosperity. He underlined the 'India Opportunity' for Sri Lanka, particularly in areas of technology, logistics and skill development.

This was followed by the keynote address by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Employment, Arun Hemachandra, who emphasised the special bonds between India and Sri Lanka as a unique strength for Sri Lanka to ride the wave of India's emergence. Proposing Joint Ventures as the way forward, he identified entrepreneurs and innovators to be leading this shared pathway.

The hybrid conference saw over a hundred participants, including senior policymakers, industry leaders, economic experts, members of think-tanks and the media community from Sri Lanka and India.

The official handing over was done by Ambassador of Japan, Akio ISOMATA, and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Sri Lanka Representative, Kunle Adeniyi, marking another crucial step in strengthening Sri Lanka's response to gender-based violence (GBV).

According to a joint statement by the UNFPA and the Government of Japan, this initiative ensures that survivors receive the protection, dignity, and support they deserve when seeking assistance from law enforcement authorities.

The establishment of the Kalutara South EWA was made possible with the funding of USD 34,000 from the People of Japan, and the construction was supported by World Vision Lanka.

Anyone in need of assistance from the Police Women and Children's Bureau is encouraged to contact the hotline at 109.

Deputy Minister of Public Security & Parliamentary Affairs, Sunil Watagala, Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka Akio ISOMATA, UNFPA Sri Lanka Representative Kunle Adeniyi,  Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security & Parliamentary Affairs Mr. D. W. R. B. Seneviratne, Additional Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security & Parliamentary Affairs Ms. Damayanthi Karunarathna, Senior DIG - Western Province Mr. Sanjeewa Dharmarathna, DIG - Children and Women Abuse Investigation Range Ms. Renuka Jayasundere, Senior Superintendent of Police Kalutara Division Mr. Kavinda Piyasekara, Headquarters Inspector Mr. Ruwan Wijesinghe, and police officers from the Kalutara Division were present at the opening ceremony.

The Emergency Waiting Area in Kalutara South joins a growing network of operational EWAs across Sri Lanka, including Jaffna, Mirihana, Pudukuduirippu, Nuwara Eliya, Mundalam, Batticaloa, and Kandy, where over 4000 women and children received support in the last year alone. These safe spaces serve as temporary resting areas, providing survivors of GBV with protection, psychosocial support, medical referrals, legal aid, and a survivor-centered approach to justice.

As part of this project, six more Emergency Waiting Areas will be established in the coming weeks in Dharmapuram (Kilinochchi district), Murunkan (Mannar district), Uppuveli (Trincomalee district), Opanayake (Ratnapura district), Walapane (Nuwara Eliya district), and Modara (Colombo district). These facilities reaffirm Sri Lanka's commitment to tackling GBV and ensuring that survivors are not left without access to critical services.

Ambassador Isomata reaffirmed Japan's continued dedication to supporting women and children in Sri Lanka and emphasized the role of safe spaces in ensuring a future free from violence. ""Japan has been promoting the protection of women and children in Sri Lanka since Sri Lanka became a partner country for Japan in 2018 in promoting the Women, Peace and Security agenda. This project also includes training for police officers handling victims, especially female officers, so that victims would feel safer in seeking refuge and counseling. I hope this project will be expanded by Sri Lanka's Ministry of Public Security and Police in order to strengthen the mechanism to protect women and children in vulnerable situations. It is also essential for Sri Lanka to ensure the legal measures against the violence and support for the self-reliance of women and children who seek refuge.""

Speaking at the ceremony, UNFPA Sri Lanka Representative, Kunle Adeniyi, underscored the significance of survivor-centered approaches in addressing GBV. ""For a survivor, the decision to seek help is often fraught with fear: fear of judgment, disbelief, or retaliation. When they walk into a police station, they should not only find protection but also compassion and care. A survivor's first interaction with law enforcement can shape their entire journey toward healing and justice. If they are met with understanding, respect, and support, they are more likely to pursue the help they need.""

UNFPA Sri Lanka expresses its deep appreciation to the People of Japan, the Ministry of Public Security, the Sri Lanka Police, and World Vision Lanka for their invaluable support in making survivors feel safe and encouraged to seek assistance in times of distress. (Newswire)"

Mr. Jaishankar detailed Sri Lanka's legal framework, stating, ""Sri Lanka has two laws -- the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act of 1996 and the Fisheries Regulation of Foreign Fishing Boats of 1979. Both these acts were amended in 2018 and 2023, providing for much stiffer sentences, bigger fines, and greater detention.""

He explained that many of those serving sentences are boat owners, skippers, or repeat offenders, complicating resolution efforts. He stated that the ""root cause"" of the ongoing issue related to the detention of Indian fishermen in Sri Lanka began in 1974 when the international maritime boundary line was drawn, followed by an exchange of letters in 1976 with Sri Lanka delineating fishing jurisdiction.

The house is aware that, in a way, our government has inherited the problem. This problem began in 1974 when the international maritime boundary line was drawn, followed by an exchange of letters in 1976 delineating fishing jurisdiction. These decisions are the root cause of the situation,"" EAM said while replying to the question raised by DMK MP Tiruchi Siva.

Mr. Jaishanakar further noted that the majority of the fishermen detained in Sri Lanka are from Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry due to geographical proximity.

""Because it is Sri Lanka, it is natural that the majority of the fishermen will be from Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry,"" he said, outlining the issue's regional context.

Providing an update on the number of fishermen detained in Sri Lanka, Mr. Jaishankar said, ""Till yesterday, there were 86 Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan custody. Today, one more trawler has been apprehended, adding 11 more fishermen. So, in total, 97 are in custody -- 83 are serving sentences, three are awaiting trial, and 11 have been apprehended today.""

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/28/gp-certified-launches-to-revolutionise-plastic-recycling/,2025-03-28,GP Certified Launches to Revolutionise Plastic Recycling,"In a significant step towards sustainable plastic waste management, Island Climate Initiative (ICI) officially launched GP Certified, Sri Lanka's first certification mechanism for high-quality recycled plastics. The launch event, held in Colombo, brought together key stakeholders including FMCG brands, recyclers, policymakers, and environmental advocates to introduce the future of sustainable packaging in Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka generates thousands of tonnes of plastic waste annually, yet only 4% is recycled. Most plastic waste is either burned or dumped into landfills, polluting our oceans and waterways. GP Certified aims to change this by promoting better recycling practices and encouraging FMCG companies to use recycled plastics in their packaging. This will reduce reliance on imported virgin plastics and less plastic waste will enter the environment.

The GP certification provides recyclers with clear industry guidelines to ensure plastics are recycled to higher standards under safe, ethical and environmentally responsible conditions. This means FMCG companies can confidently and safely use recycled plastics in their packaging, supporting a more sustainable circular economy.

Speaking at the launch event, Mr Chaminda Rajapakse, Managing Director of Island Climate Initiative, stated: ""With GP Certified, plastic waste becomes something useful empowering our communities, strengthening local businesses, saving foreign exchange and protecting our island's natural beauty.""

A key feature of GP Certified is its certification label, which will be displayed on FMCG packaging made with verified recycled plastic. This label guarantees that the packaging meets strict standards across three key areas: safety, ensuring that recycled materials comply with health and hygiene requirements; quality, verifying durability and usability in packaging applications; and sustainability, promoting ethical sourcing and responsible waste management.

This initiative will also help recyclers adopt best practices, provide better working conditions, and drive demand for recycled plastics in Sri Lanka's FMCG sector.

""The GP Certified initiative is a game-changer for the recycling industry. It ensures that the plastics we process meet high standards for safety and quality, which will not only boost consumer confidence but also increase demand for recycled plastics from the FMCG sector."" - Chullaka Hapuarachch, Ecopoly (Pvt) Ltd.

GP Certified is funded by the PLEASE Project, implemented by the South Asia Co-operative Environment Programme, supported by the World Bank, with implementing support from UNOPS."

This joint campaign is a collaborative initiative by the United Nations in Sri Lanka together with the Ministry of Health and Mass Media, and is implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and UNICEF in Sri Lanka, with support from the UN Sri Lanka SDG Fund.

Held in Colombo, the launch event saw the participation of Hon. Dr. Hansaka Wijemuni, Deputy Minister of Health and Mass Media; Mr. Marc-André Franche, Resident Coordinator, United Nations in Sri Lanka; Ms. Azusa Kubota, Resident Representative, UNDP Sri Lanka; and Mr. Christian Skoog, Representative, UNICEF Sri Lanka alongside senior ministry officials, journalists, civil society actors, and media professionals.

Commenting on the effects of dangerous speech, Hon. Dr. Hansaka Wijemuni, Deputy Minister of Health and Mass Media noted, ""The power to combat hate speech misinformation and disinformation does not lie only with the government, tech companies and journalists, it lies also with the people. Let us work together to strengthen the policies to combat online hate speech and misinformation.""

The centrepiece of the campaign is a series of short videos, developed using real-time data from Sri Lanka's online and offline spaces. These stories reflect the very real consequences of dangerous speech on individuals and communities, particularly women, youth, and marginalized groups.

Mr. Marc-André Franche, the United Nations Resident Coordinator highlighted the UN Secretary-General's Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech which provides a clear framework to counter hate while upholding freedom of expression--a balance that is critical in a rapidly polarizing global and national media landscape in which greater responsibility is placed on governments, civil society, media and individual users to navigate online harm: ""The rise in online harmful speech, particularly during politically sensitive periods, is a disturbing trend we must confront together"", stated Mr. Franche.

According to the UN Early Warning Brief (February 2025), 46% of online harmful speech still targets women, despite a 22% month-on-month drop in total harmful content. These trends reinforce the urgent need for public awareness, especially around the gendered impacts of disinformation and hate speech.

""In the digital world, you can press 'undo' -- but in real life, the damage caused by harmful speech is ingrained in someone's hearts and minds, and often irreversible,"" said Ms. Azusa Kubota, Resident Representative, UNDP in Sri Lanka. ""We hope the media will carry this message forward to enhance awareness amongst the public on the unintended and intended consequences of harmful speech, and promote responsible dialogue towards social cohesion.""

""As UNICEF we have taken several actions to empower communities and future generations. We are equipping young minds with skills to engage in safe internet use and nurture critical thinking skills to recognize, challenge, and reject false and harmful language before it takes root"", said Christian Skoog, UNICEF Representative in Sri Lanka. ""In addition, UNICEF is working with grassroots organizations and religious leaders to actively prevent and counter hate speech and misinformation in their communities"", he added.

The campaign which will run on mainstream media and digital outlets aims to spark national conversation, build digital literacy, and encourage responsible storytelling with media professionals playing a central role in carrying the message to the public."

The country's military-led government said in a statement that 1,002 people have now been found dead and another 2,376 injured, with 30 others missing. The statement suggested the numbers could still rise, saying ""detailed figures are still being collected.""

Myanmar is in the throes of a prolonged and bloody civil war, which is already responsible for a massive humanitarian crisis. It makes movement around the country both difficult and dangerous, complicating relief efforts and raising fears that the death toll could still rise precipitously.

The earthquake struck midday Friday with an epicenter not far from Mandalay, followed by several aftershocks including one measuring a strong 6.4 magnitude. It sent buildings in many areas toppling to the ground, buckled roads, caused bridges to collapse and burst a dam.

In neighboring Thailand, the quake rocked the greater Bangkok area, home to some 17 million people -- many of whom live in high-rise buildings -- and other parts of the country.

Bangkok city authorities said so far six people have been found dead, 26 injured and 47 are still missing, most from a construction site near the capital's popular Chatuchak market.

When the quake hit, the 33-story high-rise being built by a Chinese firm for the Thai government wobbled, then came crashing to the ground in a massive plume of dust that sent people screaming and fleeing from the scene.

On Saturday, more heavy equipment was brought in to move the tons of rubble, but hope was fading among friends and family members of the missing that they would be found alive.

Myanmar's government said blood was in high demand in the hardest-hit areas. In a country where prior governments sometimes have been slow to accept foreign aid, Min Aung Hlaing said Myanmar was ready to accept assistance.

A 37-member team from the Chinese province of Yunnan reached the city of Yangon early Saturday with earthquake detectors, drones and other supplies, the official Xinhua news agency reported.

Russia's emergencies ministry dispatched two planes carrying 120 rescuers and supplies, according to a report from the Russian state news agency Tass.

India sent a search and rescue team and a medical team as well as provisions, while Malaysia's foreign ministry said the country will send 50 people on Sunday to help identify and provide aid to the worst-hit areas.

The United Nations allocated $5 million to start relief efforts. President Donald Trump said Friday that the U.S. was going to help with the response, but some experts were concerned about this effort given his administration's deep cuts in foreign assistance.

The Trump administration's cuts to the United States Agency for International Development have already forced the United Nations and non-governmental organization to cut many programs in Myanmar. (AP)"

Accordingly, this matter was discussed at length in the committee, and it was revealed that the former Minister of Health had instructed to select a private company called 'Savorite' to import the medicines in short supply for 3 months.

Meanwhile, the Committee also discussed at length the Cabinet Memorandum submitted by the former Minister of Health on 26 September 2022. The Committee Chair inquired from the Ministry of Health officials about the fact that a large number of medicines would reach zero levels within the next 3 weeks from the date of submission of the relevant Cabinet Memorandum.

The officials who responded said that the information had been added to the Cabinet Memorandum based on the information obtained from the existing database regarding medicines. However, the committee Chair said that it was unacceptable for a large number of medicines to reach zero levels at the same time and that the relevant responsible officials had acted irresponsibly until such a level was reached.

The Auditor General, who spoke at the time, stated that the medicines that were ordered and to be received in advance have also been imported, citing that the medicines have reached zero levels.

Accordingly, the committee chair instructed the officials to submit a full report to the Committee on who were the officials involved in preparing this Cabinet Memorandum. The Chair further stated that a full report regarding the import of these medicines will be prepared by the Committee and submitted to Parliament, and that necessary action will be taken expeditiously.

The video, which went viral recently, drew criticism for allegedly mocking the Veddah community. In response, Blok & Dino clarified that the man featured is an impersonator who adopts a Veddah-inspired lifestyle, and not an actual member of the community.

They stressed that the video was filmed in an area with no Veddah settlements, and that ""no malice was intended, and certainly no disrespect.""

The duo added that they had previously communicated with an individual who identified himself as representing the community and were unaware of further concerns until media reports surfaced.

""Comedy--like all art--is subjective. So is the way we interpret it, and the choice to take offense,"" the statement said."

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/29/bill-gates-says-ai-will-replace-two-major-professions-in-next-10-years/,2025-03-29,Bill Gates says AI will replace two major professions in next 10 years,"Bill Gates has predicted that advancements in artificial intelligence will significantly reduce humanity's role in many traditional tasks such as medicine and education -- and the seismic shift could happen in less than 10 years.

During a recent interview with comedian Jimmy Fallon on NBC's ""The Tonight Show,"" the Microsoft co-founder described a future where humans are no longer necessary ""for most things"" because AI technology will readily perform tasks that currently require specialized human skills.

Today, expertise in fields such as medicine and education remains ""rare,"" Gates said, adding that those areas depend on ""a great doctor"" or ""a great teacher.""

But over the next decade, ""great medical advice [and] great tutoring"" will become free and commonplace, Gates said.

Gates further elaborated on this vision of a new era he terms ""free intelligence"" in a conversation last month with Arthur Brooks, a Harvard professor known for his research on happiness.

AI technology will increasingly permeate daily life, revolutionizing areas from healthcare and diagnosis to education -- with AI tutors becoming broadly available, the mogul predicted.

""It's very profound and even a little bit scary -- because it's happening very quickly, and there is no upper bound,"" Gates told Brooks. (Sky News)
