https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/30/no-adani-deal-unless-its-our-price-president/,2025-03-30,No Adani deal unless it's our price - President,"President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has firmly stated that his government will not proceed with the power purchase agreement for the Mannar wind power plant unless the company agrees to the government's proposed price.

Addressing a National People's Power (NPP) election rally, he noted that the previous government had agreed to a rate of US$ 8.26 cents per unit, while the current agreement with a different company secured a deal at US$ 4.57 cents per unit--a difference that translates to Rs. 25 per unit instead of Rs. 13.

""I saw the former President has told to somehow proceed with the previous agreement [With Adani group]. We will never proceed until they agree to our price, irrespective of whatever agreement was signed,"" he asserted.

The President also questioned where the additional costs were going, alleging corruption in past administrations.

The Adani Group February said that it has pulled out of further engagement in a $442 million wind power venture in Sri Lanka after the country's authorities attempted to modify the agreement.

In a media statement, the group wrote, ""Adani Green Energy has conveyed its Board's decision to respectfully withdraw from further engagement in the RE wind energy project and two transmission projects in Sri Lanka (NewsWire)"

The President made these remarks while attending a public gathering held yesterday (29) in the Tissamaharama area of the Hambantota District, as part of the victorious people's rally series, ""Jaya Niyathai Gama Apitai"" (""Victory is Certain - The Village is Ours."")

Addressing the gathering, President Disanayake further stated;

""Tissamaharama has always brought us great victories. We have no doubt about Tissa. Now, we have initiated a significant transformation in Sri Lankan politics. Power has shifted from the old faction, which governed the country for a long time, to a new group representing the common people. This is not an ordinary occurrence. The first step in this shift was taken during the last presidential election. In the general election, we secured the highest number of parliamentary seats in Sri Lanka's history. We are confident that we will receive an even greater mandate in the local government elections. We believe that the people will not allow this transformation to be reversed. Moving forward with this change is the only path for the people of our country.

When we assumed power, our country was not economically stable. Just two and a half years ago, Sri Lanka was in a state of severe bankruptcy. Due to the weaknesses of the previous rulers who governed the country for a long time, we faced the worst crisis a nation could endure. The most devastating economic downfall for a country is bankruptcy. We became a nation isolated from the world, unable to repay our debts. Even a hundred years from now, when books are written about Sri Lanka's economy, the economic crisis of 2021-2023 will be recorded in history. It will be remembered as a time when the state was unable to repay its debts, unable to secure dollars to import fuel, unable to find funds to import medicines and faced a shortage of funds to import gas. It was a period when the people took to the streets and ousted the rulers and the head of state had to flee for safety.

When a country goes bankrupt, it typically takes around ten years to recover. Many nations that have faced such crises have taken a similar duration to regain stability. However, we have managed to stabilise the economy within a short period.

Investors need confidence to come to Sri Lanka. Over the past five years, investors have stayed away from the country. At present, investors are engaging in discussions with the government.

We are currently in talks regarding the Hambantota oil refinery project, the largest investment in Sri Lanka, which is now in its final stages. On the 5th, with the participation of the Indian Prime Minister, the foundation stone will be laid for a power plant in Sampur. Investments have already begun to flow in. A 100-megawatt solar power plant is planned in Siyambalanduwa. Investments have also been made for a wind power plant in Mannar. A new storage terminal is planned for construction in Kerawalapitiya. Land suitable for investment in Colombo is being identified and will soon be publicly announced for investors. Step by step, investors have started focusing on Sri Lanka again.

During the economic crisis, investors who were constructing the Katunayake airport expansion abandoned the project. Now, within the next two months, we will complete that project. The investors who were developing the Kadawatha-Mirigama expressway also withdrew, but we have now resumed construction. The government has successfully restarted abandoned projects and investments. The current administration has managed to stabilise the exchange rate at LKR 300 per US dollar. Previously, the exchange rate fluctuated overnight. Interest rates have been stabilised, and the stock market has seen significant growth, indicating economic stability. Following debt restructuring, we have already repaid over USD 500 million without affecting the exchange rate.

For over five years, vehicle imports were banned. The vehicle market has now been gradually reopened. All these developments signal positive economic prospects. Over the past six months, the government has been able to stabilise the economy. Moving forward, we cannot afford to foster mistrust in the government.

The financial stability we have regained is now being redirected to benefit the people. For nearly four to five years, no new employees were recruited into the public sector. We have now decided to recruit 30,000 new employees into the public service. Funds have been allocated in this year's budget for this purpose. At present, 15,700 vacancies have been identified and a committee has been appointed to identify the remaining vacancies. There is a shortage of Technical Officers (TOs) in local councils, causing difficulties in road construction due to technical issues. The economic stability we have achieved is now being translated into benefits for the people. Therefore, after five years of no recruitment, we are resuming hiring for the public service this year.

The basic salaries of public sector employees have been significantly increased, with LKR 110 billion allocated to cover the increased wages. It is essential to safeguard our professionals. Pensioners have also been granted salary increments. Fertiliser subsidies provided to paddy farmers have now been extended to farmers cultivating other crops, with cabinet approval. For the first time in Sri Lanka's history, financial assistance has been provided to schoolchildren for purchasing school supplies. This government ensures that funds are safeguarded and utilised for the benefit of the people.

Allowances for kidney patients have been increased, Mahapola scholarships have been raised, and funds allocated for school meal programmes have been expanded. The government is taking all necessary measures to support the people. Unemployment allowances have been increased, and from June onwards, financial assistance will be provided to 400,000 individuals who currently do not receive unemployment benefits but are in need. Every schoolgirl will receive eight sanitary napkins per month, with funds allocated for this initiative. Our welfare programmes have been further strengthened.

This government is committed to ensuring that the benefits of economic recovery reach the people and that all citizens receive the support they need.

Plans have been formulated to develop the transport system. There are proposals to integrate both state-owned and private bus services. A standardisation initiative for buses is being introduced, with LKR 3 billion allocated for the importation of buses meeting the new standards. Efforts are being made to establish a comfortable and efficient public transport service.

A budget allocation of LKR 650 billion has been set aside for the healthcare sector. These funds will be used to procure equipment, import medicines and construct buildings. Every family should have access to a designated family doctor and a pilot project is being developed to facilitate this. This initiative will eliminate the need for individuals to visit multiple hospitals and doctors. A structured programme will be established to ensure that patients follow the recommendations of their family doctor.

A new curriculum is set to be introduced for education in 2026. After completing their Grade 9 examination, students will receive guidance on the best career paths based on their abilities. The financial burden on families for healthcare, education and transport will be reduced, with the government assuming responsibility for these costs. The money saved by families can then be used for other purposes, such as leisure activities or travel.

No previous government has taken responsibility for incarcerated individuals. Consequently, a programme has been developed to assess their vocational skills and provide them with vocational training certificates, thereby facilitating employment opportunities. Children in orphanages will receive a monthly allowance of LKR 5,000, with LKR 3,000 of this amount being mandatorily allocated to a fixed deposit. Additionally, every child who gets married will receive LKR 1 million from the government for housing construction. This administration is committed to ensuring that no individual is left behind and is dedicated to enhancing public services.

Special attention is being given to the tourism sector. The year 2025 is expected to witness the highest number of tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka. Plans are in place to improve the necessary infrastructure and expand tourist destinations. The goal is to make tourism a continually growing sector that significantly contributes to economic development. This year is also projected to record the highest exports of goods and services. It is anticipated that foreign remittances from Sri Lankan migrant workers will reach an all-time high in 2025. Additionally, this year is expected to generate the highest state revenue, with the Inland Revenue Department exceeding its monthly targets. Citizens are becoming more accustomed to paying taxes, and every rupee collected will be meticulously spent for the benefit of the public. This is the correct approach to nation-building, and the country is on a path of rapid progress.

The current administration has eliminated corruption and ensured justice is served. The legal and judicial systems, including the Criminal Investigation Department and the Attorney General's Department, are functioning effectively. Presently, three ministers and a police chief are in remand custody, while another minister and a police chief, who were previously in hiding, have re-emerged. Investigations are progressing efficiently, and legal proceedings are being conducted systematically to ensure successful prosecutions. All inquiries, including those into high-profile corruption cases, are advancing without obstruction. Only a government driven by national integrity can effectively combat corruption and uphold justice.

A total of LKR 1.4 trillion has been allocated as capital expenditure for the construction of roads for the benefit of the public. The allocated funds must be utilised correctly and the projects completed within the next eight months. In the past, there was a lack of funds for development; however, today, while funds are available, there is a shortage of workers. To address this, financial provisions have been made for new recruitments into the public sector. Additionally, funds have been allocated for the completion of partially constructed expressways. Surplus funds will be redirected for the benefit of the people. The public sector must improve efficiency and deliver services effectively.

For the successful execution of these projects, strong political leadership is essential at the local level. Just as the President and Parliament govern at the national level, local government authorities must oversee regional projects. A local government body that collaborates with the central government is crucial. Without this coordination, progress will be hindered, akin to a cart being pulled in opposite directions by two oxen. Leadership at the village level is essential for implementing grassroots initiatives.

In June, proposals will be gathered for the upcoming budget, which is set to be presented to Parliament in November. To strengthen this process, granting local government power to the National People's Power (NPP) will ensure the effective formulation of budget proposals. By supporting the NPP, citizens will not only contribute to the party's success but also play a role in achieving national progress.""

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/30/clean-sri-lanka-urban-forest-project-launches/,2025-03-30,"""Clean Sri Lanka"" Urban Forest project launches","Under the Clean Sri Lanka Programme, the first phase of the Urban Forest Project was launched this morning (30) near the Kelaniya Bridge in Peliyagoda.

This initiative was implemented in collaboration with S-lon Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, a subsidiary of The Capital Maharaja Group, aligning with the ""Tree Guardian"" project. It also coincided with today's (30) Zero Waste Day, further reinforcing its environmental significance.

Guided by the Presidential Secretariat, key government and private sector stakeholders, including the Road Development Authority, the Urban Development Authority and the Colombo Municipal Council, partnered in the project's execution.

As part of the initiative, trees were planted on state-owned land between the Nawaloka Roundabout and the New Kelani Bridge in Peliyagods, transforming the area into an attractive urban forest plantation.

A unique aspect of this project is the assignment of responsibility for the protection and maintenance of the planted trees to various community groups, such as school students, university students and Daham Pasal (Religious School) students.

Specifically, the students of Dharmawijaya Daham Pasala in Peliyagoda were entrusted with the care and preservation of the trees planted near the Kelaniya Bridge.

Additionally, a mobile application (APP) has been introduced to continuously monitor and update the growth and condition of the trees, as well as track the progress of their respective caretakers.

Delivering the keynote address at the ceremony, Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake emphasized that this project is not merely a reforestation initiative but a social, environmental and ethical movement closely linked to the objectives of the Clean Sri Lanka Programme.

Highlighting the historical challenges faced by tree planting projects initiated by previous governments, he noted that many such initiatives have struggled to achieve long-term success. However, he expressed confidence that, due to its strong public participation, the Clean Sri Lanka Programme would ensure the Urban Forest Project evolves into a sustainable and enduring initiative.

Attending the event as a Guest of Honour, Minister of Power and Energy Kumara Jayakody emphasized that the concept of green cities has gained global attention, with increasing focus on urban forests.

The Minister highlighted the importance of fostering a mindset shift among the public to achieve these environmental goals effectively. He stressed that assigning responsibility to the people in implementing this project is crucial for its success.

Furthermore, he pointed out that greater attention is now being directed toward renewable energy sources as part of efforts to create a sustainable environmental system.

Minister of Urban Development, Housing, and Construction Anura Karunatilaka, who also participated in the event, noted that while urbanization has made life more convenient, it has also resulted in significant losses.

He explained that Sri Lanka is now experiencing the negative consequences of urbanization, including environmental pollution, water contamination, air pollution and rising global temperatures. In searching for solutions to these challenges, initiatives such as urban forest projects play a vital role.

The event was also attended by Minister of Rural Development, Social Security and Community Empowerment Upali Pannilage, along with S.C. Weerasekara, Operations Manager of The Capital Maharaja Group and Senior Additional Secretary to the President, Russell Appuhamy, who addressed the gathering.

Among the other distinguished attendees were Senior Additional Secretary to the President Roshan Gamage, Additional Secretary to the President S.P.C. Sugeeshwara, Chief Executive Officer of S-lon Lanka (Pvt) Ltd Nalin Jayawardena and Chief Executive Officer of PE Plus (Pvt) Ltd Shehan Amarasinghe.

They stated that he was taken into custody due to concerns over his radical views and because he is considered a person who shows a tendency to engage in some form of terrorist activity.

The arrest, which took place on 22nd March, followed an investigation into a sticker condemning Israeli military actions in Gaza that had been pasted inside the shopping mall. Police said the inquiry led them to the youth, whose behavior and background raised red flags beyond the sticker incident itself.

According to the statement, the arrest was not based solely on the content of the sticker, but because the suspect was identified as someone who could pose a threat under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).

The police response came a day after a protest was held in Slave Island demanding the youth's release. Protesters claimed he was detained simply for expressing solidarity with Palestinians. The suspect, who had been working as a salesperson at the mall, is currently being held by the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) under a detention order."

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/31/a-battle-for-survival-sri-lankas-escalating-human-elephant-conflict/,2025-03-31,A battle for survival: Sri Lanka's escalating Human Elephant Conflict,"By Rushika Rodrigo

Despite a dense human population of over 22 million, Sri Lanka is home to an estimated 4,400 elephants, which represent roughly 10% of the global total of Asian elephants in the wild.

With an increasing population of both of these species and crops expanding significantly, humans and elephants, shared habitats have become unavoidable, which in turn makes the Human-Elephant conflict inevitable.

Another study in 2010 says that the Department of Wildlife Conservation recognizes that about 70% of the elephants' range lies outside the system of national parks and nature reserves.

A decade later, the consequences of this conflict are stark. A BBC report in 2020 revealed a grim statistic: 361 elephants died in the year 2019 and most were killed by people. In September 2019, officials said that they suspected seven elephants found dead in a reserve were poisoned by local residents for destroying crops.

Then a report from CENS in 2023 revealed that in 2020, Sri Lanka recorded 318 elephant deaths due to human-elephant conflict, with the number rising to 375 in 2021. This ongoing conflict between humans and elephants escalated further in 2022, making it one of the worst years on record, with 433 elephant deaths and 145 human fatalities.

The situation worsened in 2023, with 488 elephant deaths, and continued into 2024, when 388 wild elephants were reported dead. To give this some context, 78 wild elephant deaths from the Polonnaruwa Wildlife Zone, 53 from the Anuradhapura Wildlife Zone, and 43 from the Uva Wildlife Zone were reported.

A crisis of survival

Many of these deaths were caused by various accidents including poisoning, train accidents, road accidents, and elephants falling into wells used for cultivation. There were 84 elephant deaths from shootings, 56 from electrocution, and 52 from consuming 'Hakka Patas' or jaw bombs.

On the other hand, between 2019 and 2022, Sri Lanka saw a significant rise in human fatalities as a result of HEC. In 2019, 122 human deaths were reported, with the annual toll decreasing to an average of 112 in 2020. But, this number climbed to 142 fatalities in 2021, followed by 145 human deaths in 2022. In 2023, the number again spiked to 182 deaths, as noted in a 2025 study, while 2024 saw 155 human lives lost.

VOA News in a 2024 report said that between the years, 2015 and 2024, the deaths of nearly 1,195 people and 3,484 wild elephants were accounted for as consequences of this HEC problem. In January of 2025, 3 more people and 43 elephants were said to be killed.

These figures highlight not only the tragic loss of life of both humans and animals but also the immense economic toll of this escalating crisis. The disposal of the carcasses of wild elephants cost an approximate $11.6 million while compensation for the deaths of elephant attack victims was about $4 million over the same period.

Tragedy and toll

As human populations grow and elephant habitats shrink, elephants are eventually forced to raid crops, destroy property, and sometimes kill farmers, putting entire farming communities at risk.

In such areas, not only farmers but also their families were reported trampled to death by elephants. When farms and crops are nested by plants and trees elephants love to feast and farmers clear forests and expand their crops continuously, it is an unavoidable circumstance that they are constantly intruded on by elephants.

On the other hand, a study done in 2021 mentions that Sri Lanka has consistently recorded more than 200 elephant killings a year for the past 3 years even though elephant killing is considered a criminal offense in Sri Lanka.

Moreover, though Sri Lanka allows electric fences to keep these animals away, the suffering it causes them is unfathomable. Yet, Sri Lanka has 5, 000 km (3, 100 miles) of electric fencing mitigating the survival of elephants and reinforcing the act of killing them. One unfortunate instance of this is when one of Sri Lanka's largest tusker elephants, Deega Danthu was reported dead after being fatally entangled in an illegal electric fence at the Kalawewa National Park.

This is the harsh reality that proves this conflict to be ever-escalating.

The most recent incident witnessing this conflict happened on Feb 20th, 2025 near Minneriya where a passenger train collided with a herd of elephants in Sri Lanka killing six of them.   General Manager of Railways, Dhammika Jayasundara speaking to the Daily Morning outlined a series of measures aimed at preventing such devastating incidents in the future.

""First, we will introduce technological equipment to help detect and prevent such incidents. Secondly, we will clear both sides of the tracks to allow elephants to move freely and avoid getting trapped. Additionally, we will launch an awareness program for department employees to educate them on how to handle these situations. Ensuring good visibility for train drivers and well-functioning brakes can also help prevent accidents; so, we will deploy trains best suited for these conditions,"" he explained.

Steps towards coexistence

The solutions to this matter are in the hands of every individual as well as the government of Sri Lanka which requires a more collective approach and, in this case, struggles faced by both species should be brought to attention.

In response to this multifaceted conflict, people, in general, can follow an action plan where they initiate safe and sustainable agricultural practices, protect elephant habitats, build safer elephant corridors where they can travel back and forth between habitats, construct well-planned development projects without disrupting elephant migration routes, utilize natural deterrents such as beehive fences and chili fences to keep elephants away from rural communities.

However, these commitments are not enough and feasible without the contribution of the government to this matter. With regard to train-elephant collisions, responsible departments such as Wildlife Conservation can revise train schedules for times elephants are not traveling between habitats.

To encourage the implementation of all these actions, a public consultation should also be conducted where people can spread awareness on this matter which is a must to mitigate this matter.  (Newswire)"

Wickremesinghe's comments come after two powerful earthquakes devastated central Myanmar on Friday, disrupting health services and putting thousands at risk of life-threatening injuries and disease outbreaks.

Issuing a statement, Wickremesinghe highlighted the historic and religious ties between the two countries, particularly through Theravada Buddhism. He noted that the Amarapura and Ramanna sects have strong links with Myanmar.

Referring to Sri Lanka's response to the 2015 Nepal earthquake, Wickremesinghe said the country sent a military team for emergency operations and was the second-largest aid contributor after India.

""Sri Lanka must act. My proposal is to deploy members of the military's medical corps to establish a temporary hospital in Myanmar,"" he said, adding that the Sri Lanka could also send medical supplies if needed.

Wickremesinghe also cited historical support from Myanmar during the Chola invasions, recalling that King Anawrahta of Bagan had sent aid to King Vijayabahu of Sri Lanka. ""If these areas with historic links to Sri Lanka are in need of assistance, we must look into these too,"" Wickremesinghe said.

Among those rescued from the rubble in Mandalay in the early hours of Monday were a pregnant woman and a girl, the Xinhua news agency reported.

Mandalay is near the epicentre of the 7.7-magnitude earthquake on Friday that wreaked mass devastation in Myanmar and caused damage and deaths in neighbouring Thailand.

China, India and Thailand are among Myanmar's neighbours that have sent relief materials and teams, along with aid and personnel from Malaysia, Singapore and Russia.

""It doesn't matter how long we work. The most important thing is that we can bring hope to the local people,"" said Yue Xin, head of the first detachment of the China Search and Rescue Team, Xinhua reported.

In Bangkok, Thailand's capital, emergency crews using cranes and dog sniffers on Monday continued a desperate search for 76 people believed buried under the rubble of an under-construction skyscraper that collapsed.

Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt said rescuers are not giving up despite the conventional-wisdom three-day window for finding people alive fast approaching.

""The search will continue even after 72 hours because in Turkey, people who have been trapped for a week have survived. The search has not been cancelled,"" Chadchart said.

He said machine scans of the rubble indicated there may still be people alive underneath, and dog sniffers are being dispatched to try to pinpoint their locations.

""We've detected weak life signs and there are many spots,"" he said.

Thailand's official death toll was at 18 on Sunday, but could shoot up without more rescues at the collapsed building site.

In Myanmar, state media said at least 1,700 people have been confirmed dead as of Sunday. The Wall Street Journal, citing the ruling military junta, reported the death toll had reached 2,028 in Myanmar. Reuters could not immediately confirm the new death toll. The United Nations said it was rushing relief supplies to survivors in central Myanmar.

""Our teams in Mandalay are joining efforts to scale up the humanitarian response despite going through the trauma themselves,"" said Noriko Takagi, the U.N. refugee agency's representative in Myanmar.

The ban will last for five years, as demanded by prosecutors. She has also been handed a four-year prison sentence to be served with an electronic tag.

Le Pen said ahead of the verdict that a guilty ruling could lead to her ""political death.""

The court ruled that Le Pen and her National Rally party (RN) misused €3 million ($3.25 million) in European Parliament funds meant for parliamentary assistants.

Prosecutors alleged that the money in question was used to pay France-based party staff between 2004 and 2016, violating EU rules.

Le Pen, 56, denied any wrongdoing, calling the case a political attack aimed at ending her career.

""There are 11 million people who voted for the movement I represent,"" said Le Pen ahead of the ruling on Monday. She also claimed that the case against her would mean ""potentially millions of French people seeing themselves deprived of their candidate in the election.""

She left the court dramatically before anything was said about the duration of the ban.

Le Pen's political future

Prosecutors asked that Le Pen face an immediate five-year ban from public office if found guilty, regardless of any appeal process.

This could prevent her from running in the 2027 presidential election, where she is a leading contender. An appeal would trigger a retrial, likely in 2026, just months before the vote.

Le Pen's party said the trial is a judicial overreach, similar to what US President Donald Trump had said about his legal troubles in the past.

""With provisional execution, the judges have the power of life or death over our movement,"" she said. ""But I don't think they'll go that far.""

Some of her rivals, including Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, have expressed concern over courts deciding who can run for office.

RN president Jordan Bardella, 29, has been tipped as a potential replacement for Le Pen at the 2027 presidential election. He, however, is not expected to match her electoral appeal.

The judge on Monday also handed down guilty verdicts to eight other members of her party who, like Le Pen, served as lawmakers in the European Parliament.

Twelve parliamentary assistants were also found guilty. (DW)"

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) successfully concluded a two-day consultative workshop titled, ""The Northern Dialogue 2025: Pathways to Development."" The event provided a vital platform for stakeholders to engage in productive discussions on a range of timely and imminent issues affecting the Northern Province. The consultative workshop focused on six key priority areas: (1) livelihood support, (2) youth skills and empowerment, (3) substance abuse,

(4) refugee returnees' and related issues, (5) psychosocial support, and (6) border governance and tourism in the Northern province of Sri Lanka. The workshop provided a platform for participants to share perspectives, collaborate to devise innovative solutions, and chart a course for sustainable development in the Northern Province, comprised of Jaffna, Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, Mannar, and Kilinochchi districts. The event was graced by Mr. L. Ilaangovan, Chief Secretary - Northern province, Mr. M. Nathagopalan - Secretary to the Governor, Mr. M. Piratheepan - District Secretary, Jaffna, and Ms. Kristin Parco, Chief of Mission for Sri Lanka and the Maldives of IOM. Representatives from the district and divisional secretariats and other key government entities in the Northern province, along with local community-based organizations, UN entities, and academia participated in this consultation, as well.

The event, hosted in Jaffna, aimed to foster collaboration among government representatives, civil society organizations, academia, and international development partners. With an agenda focused on identifying actionable steps to overcome the region's unique challenges, the dialogue facilitated meaningful exchange of ideas and solutions. The consultation fostered open discussions and laid the groundwork for an inclusive and sustainable regional roadmap.

The workshop was facilitated under the project 'Expanded Support for Durable Resettlement and Reintegration in Sri Lanka (EDRR)', funded by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Muti-Partner Trust Fund, jointly implemented by IOM and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

Ms. Kristin Parco, Chief of Mission for Sri Lanka and the Maldives of IOM, delivering the opening remarks at the event, stated, ""The Northern Province endured significant challenges due to the protracted conflict. The impact on communities has been profound, resulting in displacement, loss of livelihoods, and the destruction of infrastructure. Today, we come together to address these challenges and to chart a course for a brighter future for the people of this region.""

IOM and UNDP, through the EDRR project, have reinforced Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS), skills development, and the expansion of livelihood opportunities. By providing peer group counselling, business development trainings, and quick-impact initiatives, the project has restored hope and instilled confidence across conflict-affected communities in Northern Sri Lanka. Additionally, the project introduced National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) and Recognizing Prior Learning (RPL) programs to enhance youth employability, fostering a sense of self-reliance and personal growth.

Commenting on the initiative, Mr. L. Ilangovan, Chief Secretary of the Northern Province remarked, ""The history of displacement in the North of Sri Lanka spans over four decades, across generations. The principal challenge that befalls us today is to instill faith in the social contract and restore relations that were strained due to the conflict. We thank entities such as IOM for the support rendered in assisting Internally Displaced Persons to rebuild their lives and for the dedication in developing the Northern Province.""

IOM and the UN remain committed to serving the most vulnerable, in alignment with IOM's strategic objectives for 2024-2028-saving lives and protecting people on the move, driving solutions to displacement, and facilitating pathways for regular migration-and the central tenet of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 'Leaving no one behind'.

Exclusive to Factum and Newswire from EPIS Thinktank on Foreign and Security Policy

The Chagos Islands, or The British Indian Ocean Territory? Is the Chagos archipelago a part of Mauritius or does it belong to the United Kingdom? These questions will soon get a definite answer as a deal on the status of the Chagos Islands seems to be closed soon. Negotiations between the government of the United Kingdom and the government of Mauritius, over the status of the Chagos Islands, have been ongoing since 2022. The dispute of the islands sheds light on the British colonial legacy and how it still to this day affects its former colonial territories.

Mauritius became a British colony in 1814 after French cessation of the island as part of the Treaty of Paris. In 1968, Mauritius gained its independence. However, while the UK agreed to granting Mauritius its independence in 1968, three years earlier, it had divided its colony and broken off the Chagos archipelago to form a new colony called The British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). These islands had been administered as part of Mauritius since the 18th century. The reason for the dividing of the colonial territory lies in the strategic value of the Chagos Islands and its location in the Indian Ocean.

In 1966, the UK had agreed to building a US military base on the largest island of the Chagos archipelago: Diego Garcia. The island was chosen for its strategic location and due to the fact that the Chagos archipelago was ""uninhabited"". However, in reality, the Chagos Islands were not uninhabited but instead hosted a population of around 1,500 to 2,000 people who had lived there for centuries. Between 1967 and 1973, the UK and US displaced the Chagossian population by forcing them to move and then preventing them from returning home. The joint UK-US military base is still being used today as a basis for the maintenance of regional stability and humanitarian response.

The British control over the Chagos archipelago is legally contested and controversial. In 2010, The UK established the Chagos Maritime Protected Area (MPA), which is one of the world's largest officially designated maritime protected areas. The marine reserve covers 640,000 square kilometres of ocean water and around 70 islands and seven atolls of the Chagos archipelago. The maritime protected area protects coral atolls and has one of the healthiest reef systems in the world.

However, in 2010, leaked documents between British and US state representatives showed that the establishment of the Chagos Maritime Protected Area not only served the protection of the environment and biodiversity. The leaked documents showed that representatives from both the UK and the US viewed the establishment of the Chagos MPA as a way to ensure the long-term prevention of the displaced Chagossian population and their descendents from returning to and resettling in the Chagos Islands. The establishment of the Chagos Maritime Protected Area was deemed illegal by the Permanent Court of Arbitration under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

Indeed, time and time again, the UK's control over the Chagos Islands has been judicially contested and denounced. The ICJ stated in 2019 an advisory opinion which read that the UK had to end its administration of the islands and that the decolonisation of Mauritius could not be seen as completed until the Chagos Islands were reunited with Mauritius. As a consequence of the ICJ's advisory opinion, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution where they stated that the UK must ""withdraw its colonial administration..."" from the Chagos archipelago.

Even though the British control over the Chagos Islands has been contested, the UK has been unwilling to give up its control over the archipelago. It is not until now, in 2025, that the UK cessation of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius seems to be near. Despite the seemingly obvious right of Mauritanian ownership of the Chagos Islands, the new deal between the UK and Mauritius, where Mauritius regains control and ownership of the archipelago and the UK gets to lease its military base on Diego Garcia for 99 years with a possible extension of 40 years, has been met with opposition in the UK. Tory-leader Kemi Badenoch has stated that it is not in the British national interest to ""give away"" the islands to Mauritius.

This kind of rhetoric which insinuates that the cessation of the Chagos Islands is the UK ""giving away"" rather than ""giving back"" the islands to Mauritius is problematic. It creates a narrative that denies Mauritius's historical right to the archipelago and denies the suffering caused to the Chagossians who were forcibly removed from their homes and displaced. The return of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and allowing the displaced Chagossians to return to their homes is long overdue.

While one can understand that the UK does not want to lose their military base on the strategically placed Diego Garcia, the establishment of the military base was only possible because of the British colonial rule of the area and their forcible displacement of the population of the islands. Also, the UK will be allowed to continue operating the base for at least 99 years, if not 139 years. Therefore, they will not lose their strategic military position in the Indian Ocean. There is no reason to further delay the returning of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius.

The dispute over the Chagos Islands shows that colonialism is not a thing that strictly is in the past. The decolonisation period is not over. The former colonial powers of the world still benefit from their former colonial empires, often at the expense of their former colonies. Mauritius has a right to the Chagos Islands. The Chagossians have a right to be able to return to their homes. It is good that the UK finally is agreeing to cede its control of the Chagos archipelago. As the ICJ stated: The decolonisation of Mauritius cannot be seen as completed until the UK ends its administration of the Chagos Islands and gives them back to Mauritius.

We will present a bill to Parliament on the 8th to recover assets that have been stolen and illegally accumulated. The Proceeds of Crime Bill aims to acquire illegally accumulated wealth. We have no intention of taking personal revenge on anyone. We hope to re-establish the rule of law and sovereignty in our country,"" President Dissanayake said.

The Proceeds of Crime Bill aims to combat financial crime by addressing gaps in the legal system that allow criminals to retain control over illicitly obtained assets.

The bill empowers authorities to trace, freeze, and seize property linked to unlawful activities while establishing mechanisms for their management and eventual disposal.

Key features of the bill include the establishment of designated officers and investigation teams tasked with identifying proceeds of crime, utilising advanced investigative methods such as forensic audits and digital analysis. (Newswire)"

Minister Bimal Rathnayake said essential steps will be taken to amend the necessary laws in this regard.

He made the remarks during an observation tour of the Jaffna International Airport in Palali.

""A preliminary decision has been made, especially for domestic tourists from Sri Lanka. As of now, those living in Jaffna arrive only at Katunayake Airport. Therefore, we need to develop the Palali Airport to improve domestic flights. We hope to make some changes to the laws regarding air travel in Sri Lanka to make the rules suitable for domestic flights. If that happens, we think private aircraft owners in Sri Lanka can bring planes here for those companies. They can serve the people while earning some profit,"" Minister Bimal Rathnayake said.

With the help of telesurgery and using India's first indigenously developed surgical robot, called the SSI Mantra by SS Innovations, the operation lasted 2 hours and 40 minutes.

The 35-year-old patient was diagnosed with Atrial Septal Defect (ASD), a congenital condition where a hole exists between the heart's upper chambers, making it a complex case.

The intracardiac surgery was led by Dr. Sudhir Srivastava, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of SS Innovations, in Gurugram and with support from Dr. Arul Furtado, Consultant Cardiovascular & Thoracic Surgeon at Aster CMI Hospital, Bengaluru, along with his expert team.

During a robotic surgery, the operating doctor sits behind a console wearing 3D glasses and conducts the surgery while looking at a screen. With the help of robotic arms, the surgery is done on the patient sitting at another location in the presence of an assisting doctor.

According to the doctors at both the locations, the surgery was executed with exceptional precision and imperceptible latency, demonstrating how robotic-assisted telesurgery can bring life-saving interventions closer to patients without requiring them to travel long distances.

Telesurgery has been steadily advancing in India.

Previously, remote surgeries over shorter distances, such as 40 km between Gurugram and Delhi and 286 km between Gurugram and Jaipur were conducted. However, the latest 2,000 km telesurgery marks a new milestone, proving that geographical barriers are no longer an obstacle to specialised surgical care in India.

Dr. Srivastava said the significance of telesurgery in transforming healthcare accessibility. ""With SSI Mantra, we are bridging the gap in surgical care by eliminating the need for patients to travel. This technology is not just for India but for the world. By performing telesurgery over 2,000 km, we have shown that distance is no longer a barrier to high-quality healthcare,"" he said.

""This was a significant milestone for us. The experience was seamless, and the robotic system allowed us to perform the procedure with great confidence. Telesurgery will redefine access to specialized care in India,"" said Dr. Furtado, who assisted in the surgery from Bengaluru. (India Today)"

It is a great privilege for me to extend my warmest wishes to thousands of Muslim brothers and sisters on the occasion of Ramadan. This sacred month carries profound religious, social, and cultural significance for people around the world, culminating in the joyous celebration of Eid-ul-Fitr after nearly a month of fasting.

In Islam, Ramadan--the ninth month of the lunar calendar--is regarded as a time of great virtue. During this period, devotees fast for approximately 14 hours a day, demonstrating their faith through self-discipline, perseverance, and spiritual devotion. This practice fosters both physical and mental well-being

while instilling values that benefit society. Ramadan also conveys a powerful message of generosity and equality, making it one of the most significant religious observances in the world.

As a nation, we are once again facing immense challenges. The values embodied in Ramadan can serve as a source of inspiration, reminding us of the importance of unity in overcoming adversity. By thinking beyond ourselves and working together, we can strive toward inclusive prosperity. This collective effort will also help us rebuild our country, moving from the current economic crisis toward a future of stability and growth."
https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/31/presidents-eid-message-hope-peace-and-progress/,2025-03-31,"President's Eid Message : Hope, Peace, and Progress","Eid-ul-Fitr, celebrated by Muslims worldwide after a month of fasting and upon sighting the new moon, holds great significance in the Islamic religious calendar.

Fasting during Ramadan, one of the five pillars of Islam, embodies the values of sacrifice, self-discipline and simplicity by distancing oneself from worldly desires. This period serves as a reminder of the importance of generosity towards those suffering from hunger and as an opportunity for self-restraint and spiritual growth, which devout Muslims deeply cherish.

As Sri Lanka undergoes various social, economic and political transformations, the teachings of Islam provide an excellent example for building a society rooted in freedom, equality, solidarity and human dignity. I strongly believe that these values serve as guiding principles in our collective journey toward a just and harmonious nation.

Furthermore, as we strive to foster a responsible and ethical political culture, one that values accountability over corruption and the misuse of public resources, the principles of self-restraint and sacrifice emphasized during Ramadan offer an inspiring model. They remind us of the need to cultivate a governance system that is sensitive to the aspirations and well-being of its people.

Eid-ul-Fitr is a celebration that transcends religious boundaries, promoting unity, compassion and selflessness. On this auspicious occasion, I extend my heartfelt wishes to all Sri Lankan and global Muslim communities.

May this Eid-ul-Fitr bring peace, reconciliation and the fulfillment of our shared hopes for a new era of renewal and prosperity.

Eid Mubarak!
