https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/09/indias-tech-sector-projected-to-hit-350-billion-by-2030/,2025-03-09,India's tech sector projected to hit $350 billion by 2030,"On February 24, India's Defence Minister Rajnath Singh delivered a significant address at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Mandi, highlighting the rapid growth and potential of the country's technology sector.

Singh projected that India's tech industry is on course to reach a valuation of $350 billion by 2030, driven by innovation, digital transformation, and government initiatives fostering technological advancements.

India's rising technological landscape

India has emerged as a global powerhouse in technology, fueled by a strong ecosystem of startups, increased foreign investments, and supportive government policies.

The country's digital economy has witnessed exponential growth over the past decade, bolstered by key developments in artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductor manufacturing, cybersecurity, and 5G telecommunications.

Singh emphasised that India's technology sector plays a crucial role not just in economic expansion but also in national security.

He noted that cutting-edge technological advancements are imperative for strengthening India's defence capabilities and ensuring the nation remains competitive on the global stage.

One of the primary factors contributing to India's tech boom is the government's proactive approach toward digitalisation and innovation.

Various flagship programmes, such as 'Digital India,' 'Make in India,' and 'Startup India,' have provided crucial support for tech-driven enterprises.

The government has also increased funding for research and development (R&D) initiatives, fostering a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship.

Additionally, India's push towards self-reliance (Atmanirbhar Bharat) has encouraged the domestic manufacturing of high-tech products, including semiconductors, drones, and defence equipment.

Rajnath Singh emphasised the importance of public-private partnerships in this domain, citing collaborations between IITs and industry leaders as instrumental in driving forward technological advancements.

Role of AI

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning have become fundamental to India's growth strategy.

The country has seen a surge in AI-driven applications across various industries, from healthcare and agriculture to fintech and defence. With the increased adoption of automation and data analytics, businesses are enhancing efficiency and productivity, further propelling the tech sector's valuation.

Quantum computing, blockchain, and cybersecurity are also gaining traction in India. Singh highlighted that investments in these fields will be essential in ensuring data security and positioning India as a leader in future-ready technologies.

Startup ecosystem and foreign investments

India's startup ecosystem has been a driving force behind the nation's tech sector expansion.

With over 100 unicorns and a strong pipeline of innovative companies, the country is attracting significant venture capital and foreign direct investment (FDI).

Global tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, and Apple have expanded their operations in India, underscoring the nation's growing prominence in the tech industry.

Singh pointed out that India's young and dynamic workforce is a key advantage, with millions of skilled engineers, programmers, and researchers contributing to groundbreaking innovations.

The government has also facilitated ease of doing business by streamlining regulations and providing tax incentives for tech startups.

Cybersecurity and defence tech advancements

Given his role as the Defence Minister, Singh emphasised the importance of cybersecurity in India's tech expansion.

As cyber threats become more sophisticated, investing in robust cybersecurity infrastructure is imperative for national security and economic stability.

He highlighted recent developments in indigenous defence technologies, such as advanced surveillance systems, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and secure communication networks.

The minister also underscored India's increasing focus on space technology, with ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) spearheading ambitious satellite and exploration missions.

Space-tech startups are receiving greater government support, reinforcing India's position in the global space race.

Despite the optimistic outlook, Singh acknowledged that challenges remain in achieving the $350 billion valuation target. Infrastructure constraints, digital literacy gaps, and regulatory hurdles need to be addressed to sustain long-term growth. He called for greater industry-academia collaboration to bridge skill gaps and ensure a workforce ready for emerging technological demands.

Moreover, while India is making strides in semiconductor manufacturing, reducing dependence on global supply chains remains a priority.

Strengthening indigenous production capabilities will be critical in ensuring resilience in the face of global uncertainties.

India's technology sector is at a pivotal juncture, with immense growth potential backed by government initiatives, private sector investments, and a thriving start-up ecosystem.

Indian defence minister Rajnath Singh's projection of a $350 billion valuation by 2030 underscores the transformative impact of digitalisation and innovation.

As India continues to lead in emerging technologies and defence advancements, the country is poised to become a dominant player in the global tech landscape. (News Bomb)"

MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal condemned the ""provocative activities,"" as he denounced the actions of a ""small group of separatists and extremists"" in the official statement.

""We have seen the footage of a breach of security during the visit of EAM to the UK. We condemn the provocative activities of this small group of separatists and extremists.

Earlier in January, a group of pro-Khalistan activists gathered outside the Indian High Commission in London to stage a protest. They also stormed a cinema in Harrow, attempting to disrupt the screening of the Kangana Ranaut starrer film Emergency.

Condemning the incident, Jaiswal had said, ""We have consistently raised our concerns with the UK government regarding violent protests and intimidation by anti-India elements.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/09/china-to-adopt-policies-for-ageing-population-try-to-boost-birth-rates/,2025-03-09,"China to adopt policies for ageing population, try to boost birth rates","China will ""actively"" respond to population ageing with policies for its rapidly growing elderly and its young people, including providing childcare subsidies and making preschool education free, as it tries to boost the country's declining population.

The measures were announced in two official government documents on March 5, prepared for the annual meeting of the National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp Parliament.

China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024, as marriages plummeted by one-fifth, the biggest drop on record, despite efforts by authorities to encourage young couples to wed and have children.

Rapid ageing has become a growing concern in the world's second-largest economy, with the number of those aged 60 and older expected to rise at least 40 per cent to more than 400 million by 2035, equal to the populations of Britain and the United States combined.

China said it would raise minimum basic old age benefits for rural and non-working urban residents and make an ""appropriate increase"" in the basic pension benefits for retirees, without giving other details.

It will also expand public interest elderly care services, particularly in rural areas and for seniors with physical disabilities.

Authorities will ""prudently advance the reform to gradually raise"" the statutory retirement age, said Premier Li Qiang's official work report, without giving further details.

China raised its retirement age for men to 63 years from 60, while for women in white-collar work, it was raised to 58 years from 55. For women in blue-collar work, it was increased to 55 from 50. The changes came into effect on Jan 1 and are to be implemented over a 15-year period.

Childcare

China will provide childcare subsidies, the government reports said without giving further details, and formulate ""sound plans"" for a childcare service system, including progressively making preschool education free.

Care and services for children in rural areas and those who live with migrant worker parents would also be strengthened, the authorities said.

Women in early stages of pregnancy would also be offered more services, the documents stated, without giving further details.

Much of China's demographic downturn is the result of its one-child policy imposed between 1980 and 2015. Couples have been allowed to have up to three children since 2021.

However, a rising number of young Chinese are opting to not have children, put off by the high cost of childcare or an unwillingness to marry or put their careers on hold, while gender discrimination persists.

The authorities have tried to roll out incentives and measures to encourage couples to have babies, including expanding maternity leave, financial and tax benefits for having children as well as housing subsidies.

But China is one of the world's most expensive places to bring up a child, relative to its gross domestic product per capita, a prominent Chinese think-tank said in 2024, detailing the time and opportunity cost for women who give birth. (Reuters)"
https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/09/new-trump-travel-ban-could-bar-pakistanis-afghans-soon-sources/,2025-03-09,"New Trump travel ban could bar Pakistanis, Afghans soon: sources","A new travel ban under President Donald Trump could take effect as early as next week, potentially restricting entry into the US for individuals from Pakistan and Afghanistan, sources said.

The decision is based on a government assessment of security and vetting concerns, according to three sources familiar with the matter.

The well-informed sources, who requested anonymity, said other countries could also be on the list but did not know which ones.

The move harkens back to the Republican president's first-term ban on travellers from seven majority-Muslim nations, a policy that went through several iterations before it was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.

Former president Joe Biden, a Democrat who succeeded Trump, repealed the ban in 2021, calling it ""a stain on our national conscience"".

The new ban could affect tens of thousands of Afghans who have been cleared for resettlement in the US as refugees or on Special Immigrant Visas because they are at risk of Taliban retribution for working for the US during a 20-year war in their home country.

Trump issued an executive order on January 20 requiring intensified security vetting of any foreigners seeking admission to the US to detect national security threats.

That order directed several cabinet members to submit by March 12 a list of countries from which travel should be partly or fully suspended because their ""vetting and screening information is so deficient"".

Afghanistan will be included in the recommended list of countries for a complete travel ban, said the three sources and one other who also asked not to be identified.

The three sources said Pakistan also would be recommended for inclusion.

The departments of State, Justice and Homeland Security and the Office of the Director for National Intelligence, whose leaders are overseeing the initiative, did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

One source pointed out that Afghans cleared for resettlement in the US as refugees or on special visas first undergo intense screening that makes them ""more highly vetted than any population"" in the world.

The State Department office that oversees their resettlement is seeking an exemption for Special Immigrant Visa holders from the travel ban ""but it's not assumed likely to be granted,"" the source said.

That office, the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts, has been told to develop a plan by April for its closure, Reuters reported last month.

The Taliban, who seized Kabul as the last US troops pulled out in August 2021 after two decades of war, are confronting an insurgency by Daesh's regional branch. Pakistan also is grappling with violent militants.

Trump's directive is part of an immigration crackdown that he launched at the start of his second term.

He previewed his plan in an October 2023 speech, pledging to restrict people from several Middle Eastern and African countries and ""anywhere else that threatens our security.""

Shawn VanDiver, the head of #AfghanEvac, a coalition of groups that coordinates evacuation and resettlement of Afghans with the US government, urged those holding valid US visas to travel as soon as possible if they can.

""While no official announcement has been made, multiple sources within the US government suggest a new travel restriction could be implemented within the next week,"" he said in a statement.

This ""may significantly impact Afghan visa holders who have been awaiting relocation"" to the US, he said.

There are some 200,000 Afghans who have been approved for US resettlement or have pending US refugee and Special Immigrant Visa applications.

They have been stranded in Afghanistan and nearly 90 other countries -- including about 20,000 in Pakistan -- since January 20, when Trump ordered a 90-day freeze on refugee admissions and foreign aid that funds their flights. (The International)"
https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/09/uproar-over-alleged-free-land-allotment-to-muralitharans-company-in-india/,2025-03-09,Uproar over alleged free land allotment to Muralitharan's Company in India,"Questions have been raised in the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly regarding the allotment of land to former Sri Lankan cricketer Muttiah Muralitharan's company, Ceylon Beverages.

The Jammu and Kashmir government found itself in a contentious situation on Saturday following allegations of a 25-acre free land allotment to Sri Lankan cricketer Muttiah Muralitharan's company, Ceylon Beverages.

The company plans to establish an aluminium can manufacturing and beverages filling unit in the Bhagthali industrial estate in Kathua district adjoining Punjab, with an investment of ₹1,642 crore.

The issue came to light after CPM MLA Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami raised a question in the Legislative Assembly, seeking clarity on the land deal. However, Agriculture Minister Javaid Ahmad Dar feigned ignorance when questioned, admitting that he had no knowledge of the land allotment to Muralitharan's company.

The controversy centers on the fact that the 25 acres of land were reportedly allocated to Ceylon Beverages free of charge as part of Jammu and Kashmir industrial policy, introduced after the abrogation of Article 370. The land allotment has sparked concerns among locals, especially those claiming that they had proprietary rights over the land and were allegedly evicted to make way for the project.

Muralitharan's company already operates a plant in Karnataka and now seeks to expand into Jammu and Kashmir. The lease for the land was reportedly signed on June 14 last year. According to the company's online profile, Ceylon Beverages is Sri Lanka's largest beverage processing, filling, and exporting entity, providing contract filling services to major international clients like Coca-Cola and Nestle.

J&K industrial policy, which was launched on April 1, 2021, offers incentives like subsidies on capital investment, GST rebates on plant and machinery purchases, and financial assistance for working capital loans. This policy aims to attract large-scale investments and create jobs within the region.

Since its inception, the UT administration has received interest from a range of companies, including Dubai-based Emaar Group and India's Kandhari Beverages Pvt Ltd, with proposed investments worth over ₹1.23 lakh crore.

Kathua district, due to its proximity to Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, has become a focal point for many industrial projects.

Tarigami brought up the issue during a discussion on satellite townships being developed across the Union Territory. ""What are these townships about? Who will be residing there? A Sri Lankan cricketer has been allotted land without being charged a paisa,"" he remarked.

Congress MLA Ghulam Ahmed Mir echoed Tarigami's concerns, calling the situation a ""serious issue"" that warranted a thorough discussion in the Assembly.

Responding to the concerns of the legislators, Agriculture Minister Javaid Ahmad Dar acknowledged the matter but said it falls under the Revenue Department's jurisdiction. ""We will look into the matter to verify the facts,"" he said.

This is not the first time since the abrogation of Article 370 that questions have been raised regarding land allotments in Jammu and Kashmir. However, the involvement of a high-profile foreign figure like Muralitharan has added a new layer of complexity to the ongoing debate.

In defence of the land deal, a senior government official emphasized that Muralitharan's investment aligned with the administration's larger strategy to turn Jammu and Kashmir into an industrial hub. The official stressed that such foreign investments are crucial for the region's economic growth and the creation of much-needed jobs. (Deccan Herald)"

The task force's stated mission is to ""showcase the Nation's pride and hospitality while promoting economic growth and tourism,"" according to the order. Trump will chair the body.

The U.S. is preparing to co-host the world's most-watched sports tournament alongside Canada and Mexico amid rising geopolitical tensions, as Trump escalates a trade war with the longtime allies.

Asked about co-hosting the tournament with the neighbors after slapping them with tariffs, Trump said it only adds to the drama on the pitch.

""I think it's going to make it more exciting,"" said Trump.

""Tension is a good thing,"" the president also said. ""It makes it much more exciting.""

Infantino, the controversial president of soccer's governing body, offered estimates of the economic impact the tournament will have in the U.S.

FIFA's president estimated that between the 2026 World Cup and the lesser-known 2025 Club World Cup, which will also be hosted in the U.S., the country will rake in an estimated $40 billion.

Infantino also surmised that the tournaments will add 200,000 jobs to the country and bring in 10 million tourists.

Trump asked Infantino if the U.S., a perennial underdog in men's soccer, could win the tournament for the first time in the nation's history.

""Yes, with the public behind [them],"" responded FIFA's president.

""He knows what to say,"" quipped Trump.

Infantino listed South American powerhouses Argentina and Brazil and European giants England, Germany, and Spain as the favorites for the tournament. Trump said he plans to attend ""more than one"" of the World Cup's 104 matches.

Also in the Oval Office was Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who is taking charge of security for the event. Questions about the United States' ability to host the tournament have swirled ever since mayhem erupted at the Copa América final in Florida last summer.

In July 2024, fans without tickets stormed the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, trampling security officers, breaking down barricades, and vandalizing the stadium in order to watch Argentina take on Colombia for the trophy.

Noem said she'll be running ""incident command centers"" in the American host cities and partnering with federal agencies, local law enforcement and international partners to ensure the tournament goes smoothly.

Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Seattle, and San Francisco are the American host cities for the upcoming tournament. New York and San Francisco's games will be held at stadiums in East Rutherford, N.J., and Santa Clara, Calif., respectively.

Canada's games will be hosted in Toronto and Vancouver, while Mexico's matches will be held in Guadalajara, Mexico City, and Monterrey.

The tension between the co-hosts was underscored last week when the American-born coach of the Canadian national team blasted Trump's repeated comments about Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state.

""If I have one message to our president, it's lay off the ridiculous rhetoric about Canada being the 51st state,"" Canada coach Jesse Marsch said in late February.

""As an American, I'm ashamed of the arrogance and disregard that we've shown one of our historically oldest, strongest, and most loyal allies,"" said Marsch, a native of Racine, Wisconsin, who made two appearances for the U.S. men's national team during his playing career.

Infantino also took the opportunity in the Oval Office to unveil the new trophy for FIFA's Club World Cup. The tournament, which features the best club teams from each continent, has historically been an afterthought in the soccer world. But FIFA recently raised the stakes by announcing $1 billion in prize money for the tournament. (NBC)"

During police interrogation, Ranya made several crucial revelations, including details about an international syndicate of women involved in gold smuggling.

Ranya confessed that she was a part of this smuggling network, which operates across borders and involves multiple women. This group is believed to be operating on an international scale, with some public servants also allegedly linked to the syndicate. The police are now on the lookout for other members involved in this illicit activity.

CBI joins investigation

The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) had previously acted on a tip-off, leading to Ranya's arrest as she was returning from Dubai. During a subsequent search at her residence, law enforcement officials seized millions of rupees worth of jewelry. Following Ranya's statements, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has now taken charge of the case. They are closely investigating the syndicate's operations and are working to uncover other members involved in the international gold smuggling network.

Background of Ranya Rao

Ranya Rao, a former Kannada film actress, has starred in several movies. Recently, her name has been making headlines for all the wrong reasons. Interestingly, Ranya's father is an IPS officer, though not her biological father, but a step-parent. This connection has only added to the complexity of the case, as Ranya now faces severe legal scrutiny.

Currently under police custody, Ranya is being interrogated to uncover further details about the smuggling ring. The CBI is intensifying its efforts to expose the full extent of this international women-led gold smuggling syndicate. Updates on the investigation are expected soon, as authorities continue to make headway in this high-profile case. (India TV)"

While my primary reason for mentioning Dr. Jayawardena at the beginning of this speech is to express my deepest condolences, I would take this moment to appreciate her exemplary figure as a model of dedication, integrity, and service that we can all look up to as Janaki embodied that ideal. Her students had immense love and respect for her. Beyond that, she was an exceptional colleague who worked dearly and inspired us greatly. Losing such university academics is a significant loss to the nation. That is why the speech is started in the memory of her

The protest led by the Federation of University Teachers' Associations during 2011-2012 marked a significance turning point. It was able to build the confident that the leadership can be initiated in societal movement beyond addressing the professional demands.

The protest which was held during 2011-2012 was not solely a protest held by the trade unions but it also concerned on addressing education. This protest was collectively supported by both the trade unions and the community who felt deep empathy towards the cause of education and it brought together other trade unions, teachers' unions, civil society, and the concerned citizens and who resonated out a valuable message that together we can advocate and protest for achieving a common cause. Dr. Janaki Jayawardena was one of the key figures who led this movement. She led this movement silently, without seeking the spotlight. However, the struggle would not have been successful without her. You may recall that the five-day march from Galle to Colombo was launched during this movement. University academics participated in wearing black and orange T-shirts marked with '6%'. We did not even have enough funds to print these T-shirts. Dr. Janaki Jayawardena sold a piece of her land to find funds for that purpose. That was the kind of person she was, someone who is willing to sacrifice anything for what she believed in, someone who was unafraid to lead. Her absence is deeply felt at a time like this. We need such leads.

What the universities and the society is needed at time like this is an exceptional role who see beyond their professional identities, who take responsibility for their students, their field, and their community, and who provide leadership and commitment. Her absence greatly grieved us and I extend my deepest condolence to her family, students, colleagues, and the many friends who stood by her. The primary reason for mentioning Dr. Jayawardena at the beginning of this speech was not to grieve by her absence but to commemorate her exemplary figure as a model of dedication.

The highest amount ever allocated for education in the history has been set out in this year's budget by the present government. A total of LKR 619 billion has been allocated for the next eight months of period with the allocation of LKR 21 billion specifically designated for capital expenditure and it marks the highest amount allocated for educational infrastructure in recent history.

A clear system for utilizing these funds is also presented. Without properly reforms for education, the societal transformation we envision cannot be achieved. Only through education reform we can bring about the social, political, and economic transformations. Therefore, the 2025 budget has been presented with careful consideration along with a strategic planning for education reforms.

The education reforms are expected to be achieved through five key pillars by the Ministry of Education. The first pillar is centered on the modernization of curriculum. It is expected to intrude a new curriculum that involves updating the existing curricula and designing an education system that nurtures the human resources that are needed for social transformation, and LKR 250 million has been allocated for this purpose. Further, an additional LKR 160 million has been allocated for related projects.

Educational reforms have been discussed in the past, but despite various efforts, they have not been effectively implemented for years. The primary reason addresses that the changes to curriculum alone is not enough. That is why we have identified five key pillars in our education reforms. The curriculum is just one of them, and apart from that the implementation of necessary human resources for the educational reforms has been also focused on the 2025 budget. It is focused on improving the capacity of teachers, principals, educationists, and education administrators and it is addressed by the second pillar. The budget has allocated an amount of LKR 1.64 billion which is the highest amount ever allocated in the history to develop the capacity and I am pleased that we have been able to do so.

The teachers are usually appointed to surpass the cadre of the teachers who are currently occupied in the teaching service or related fields, along with a special focus was drawn to the training teachers in training colleges and universities.

In reality, the current state of our national colleges of education is extremely concerning. I recently visited the colleges of education in Polonnaruwa and Jaffna. The students, who are expected to become teachers in the future, have no proper facilities. They lack proper accommodation, water, and even basic necessities. While we discuss smart classrooms in schools, the teachers who are supposed to conduct those lessons are learning on blackboards in underprivileged conditions. They lack electricity and essential infrastructure. That is why special attention was drawn on this matter. For years, infrastructure projects have been implemented in schools. Since 2016, under the ""Nearest School is the Best School"" program initiated by the previous government, many initiatives have been undertaken. However, even today, some of the unfinished and unsafe buildings are located in schools. Many schools have impressive gates, fences, and signboards, but once you went inside, the students do not have proper facilities. Some of the schools are not processed by clean drinking water including basic sanitation facilities. Therefore, an amount of LKR 11,000 billion has been allocated to complete these unfinished school projects, with a special focus on sanitation facilities.

Starting this year, we are committed to ensuring that no Sri Lankan child has to attend a school without proper sanitation facilities. We have also allocated LKR 11.126 billion through the line ministry and LKR 14.896 billion through provincial councils to address these issues in estate schools. It is addressed by the third pillar.

The fourth pillar is ensuring that students are receiving education as well as undergoing proper assessment. The responsibility for assessment lies with the Department of Examinations, which has faced significant challenges over the years. When I first entered Parliament, I inquired about the capital expenditure allocated to the Department of Examinations. It was significantly low. This year, we have allocated LKR 12.36 billion to strengthen the evaluation process and enhance capacity within the Department of Examinations.

The greatest challenge faced by the education system is the mental pressure that put on children due to the exam-centered approach. In order to overcome this, we must strengthen the institutions that are primarily responsible for evaluation.

According to the fifth pillar, education cannot be solely restricted to the responsibility of the Ministry, the children, the teachers, or the schools alone. It should be a transformation within society as a whole. A social discussion is essential in order to make this a reality. It is during times like this that I remember Dr. Janaki Jayawardena. Social activists are needed in establishing this discussion and the discussion has been already included in the roadmap of the government. Further, funds have been allocated specifically for the well-being of children.

Specifically I would like to remark on the higher education. We have established a top priority on the quality of higher education. Simply establishing universities is not enough; creating a university is not just about establishing a board. We have numerous examples of universities, faculties, and programs that were initiated primarily due to political reasons, with little regard on the quality of education. Moreover, the benefits for students or the impact on their education was never addressed. That is why we are giving special attention to improving the quality of higher education.

Similarly, the well-being of students is also a priority. Many young people have lost confidence in their education and future. This student community deserves to be treated with respect. While the student population has grown, yet the facilities they deserved have never been addressed. I was in Ampara yesterday and visited a local institution. I was truly shocked. This institution, which has made a significant contribution to the field of higher education since 1955, had students living under deplorable conditions. There are wires used as fences, no proper roofs, no lights, and rats everywhere. I was astonished when I saw the conditions under which these children are expected to cook and eat. They only have one meal a day, and it's only in the evening that they get to eat. There is a farming facility, but I only saw two workers there. This is the institution that was established to develop human resources for the agricultural sector in South Asia in 1955. Yet, none of this has been addressed. Similarly, I visited the German Tech institution in Kilinochchi, where there are no hostels for the students. They use makeshift offices with toilets as classrooms. Without these basic facilities, how can students feel any sense of education, dignity, or pride? We have allocated LKR 36.841 million for higher education infrastructure. We are requesting all higher education institutions to prioritize providing the necessary facilities for students. We need to ensure that we understand how they are living, how they are eating, and how they are learning.

Allocations have been made for vocational education. We aim to transform vocational education into a modern, relevant field that aligns with the needs of today's world. This will help us create a skilled workforce that meets the demands of the future labor market. By doing so, we will develop and create educational fields that provide value and skills for young people, offering them real career paths.

We urge everyone to look into this issue without any party or division. This is a crucial sector that needs to be addressed for the future of our country. Through this, we can shape our nation and our children to be fit for the world. It is not just about shaping minds, but about creating individuals with humanity, a refined and complete society. To achieve this, we must transform our education system. It must be achieved through the participation of humans. This transformation is something we are committed to bringing forward.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/10/govts-76-year-curse-narrative-vs-real-data-sajith-challenges/,2025-03-10,"Govt's ""76 year Curse narrative Vs Real Data : Sajith challenges","Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has emphasized the need for an education system that meets the demands of the international labour market while strengthening free education.

Addressing the Parliament today, MP Premadasa said the current education system requires significant reform and urged a review of whether the country's education methodology produces global citizens.

He highlighted that 70% of a child's brain develops between birth and age five, yet early childhood education, which takes place between ages three and five, remains largely informal.

The Opposition Leader noted that despite the existence of 17,910 preschools in the country, educational reforms should begin at the preschool level to formalize early childhood education.

MP Premadasa also pointed out the stark division in the country's education system, where both free education and the broader education system create a gap between the privileged and the underprivileged.

He stressed the need to protect free education through adequate funding, system reforms, and modernization to ensure both physical and human resources are available to meet modern needs.

Presenting his views on the education system, he noted that 3.8 million students are enrolled in 10,096 schools nationwide, supported by 237,000 teachers and over 12,500 principals.

He emphasized the importance of maintaining and strengthening the education system, which gained momentum through Kannangara's policies and proposed a new national policy to eliminate disparities among estate, rural, urban, and underprivileged schools, aiming to elevate all 10,096 schools to a high standard of excellence.

Why aren't you keeping your election promises?

MP Premadasa criticized the government for failing to fulfil its election promise to remove VAT on educational equipment. He pointed out the stark difference between their past pledges and current actions. While academics previously protested for 6% of GDP to be allocated to education, only 0.84% has been allocated this year, compared to 0.86% last year. He also questioned why the Prime Minister, who once championed this cause, remains silent on the issue.

Government funds alone are not enough to improve education

The Opposition Leader argued that government funds alone are insufficient for educational reforms. He proposed introducing an educational sponsorship system by engaging wealthy individuals worldwide to secure additional funds beyond the government's budget. He suggested fostering partnerships between free education schools and well-funded international schools to acquire resources. Additionally, he proposed the creation of trustee funds for every school with support from benefactors.

Implement the Subodini Report

MP Premadasa accused the government of ignoring the Subodini Report, which was once used to justify protests but has since been forgotten after gaining power. He demanded answers regarding the implementation of its recommendations and the ongoing teacher shortage.

Bring new technology to schools

Highlighting the importance of integrating information technology, digital technology, smart technology, and artificial intelligence into education, MP Premadasa questioned the government's efforts in these areas. He criticized the government's repressive approach to handling protests and urged it to provide real solutions to educational challenges.

He also stressed the need for inclusive education policies for the disabled community and pointed out that between 35,000 and 40,000 graduates remain unemployed. He criticized the Compass Party for failing to deliver on its promise of graduate employment, calling their pledges mere dreams.

Cuts to university lecturers' allowances

MP Premadasa condemned the reduction of academic and research allowances for university lecturers, as well as the removal of monthly allowances for non-academic university staff.

Political victimization in the Education Sector

He accused the government of politicizing the education sector, citing incidents such as the alleged victimization of the Dehiattakandiya Zonal Education Director and controversies surrounding the Chancellor's position at Rajarata University. He further criticized the political interference in Vice-Chancellor appointments at Rajarata, Eastern, and South Eastern Universities. He pointed to the case of the University of Ruhuna, where the governing board was dissolved after applications were called for a Vice-Chancellor position, and a less-qualified candidate was chosen over Professor Samantha Kumara.

The Government's ""76-Year Curse"" narrative vs. real data

MP Premadasa challenged the government's narrative about a so-called ""76-year curse,"" presenting statistics to highlight progress in education. He noted that literacy rates reached 92.49% by 2022, and the student-teacher ratio in primary schools improved to 16.8 students per teacher. While only 42% of students completed primary education in 1976, this figure rose to 96% by 2022. The proportion of trained primary education teachers increased from 82% in 2010 to 87% in 2022, and tertiary education enrollment grew from 18.7% in 2015 to 22% in 2022. Additionally, the number of government schools has increased from 3,188 in 1950 to 10,096 today.

He concluded by urging the government to prioritize meaningful reforms and ensure the education system serves all citizens equally. (Newswire)"

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/10/regulatory-and-environmental-hurdles-in-bangladeshs-shipbreaking-industry/,2025-03-10,Regulatory and Environmental Hurdles in Bangladesh's Shipbreaking Industry,"By Vaishali Basu Sharma

Bangladesh maintained its position as the world's top ship-breaking destination in 2024, despite a fall in imports of scrapped vessels compared to 2023. The country imported 130 ships for scrapping, marking a 23.53% decrease from the 170 ships dismantled in the previous year, according to data from the NGO Shipbreaking Platform (NSP). This decline brought imports to a six-year low, attributed to dollar constraints and subdued demand driven by economic challenges.

Previously, scrapped ships brought to Bangladesh weighed between 40,000 to 50,000 tonnes on average. However, recent imports have been much smaller, averaging about 2,000 tonnes, according to industry insiders. Despite assurances from the industry about improved safety measures and a reduction in accidents, rights groups remain concerned about the human and environmental risks associated with shipbreaking activities.

Bangladesh is the world's largest dumping ground for end-of-life vessels, reflecting the country's lenient enforcement of regulations, particularly in its hazardous ship-breaking industry. While the European Union Ship Recycling Regulation mandates that EU-flagged vessels can only be dismantled in EU-approved yards, the scrap yards in Chattogram do not meet these standards.

Up to a third of workers in Bangladesh ship-breaking yards suffer from asbestosis, a chronic lung disease caused by exposure to hazardous materials. Despite safety assurances from the industry, the risks remain significant.

According to a press release by the NGO Shipbreaking Platform, China led the way in dumping ships globally in 2024, with Chinese owners selling 71 vessels for dismantling in South Asia, 59 of which were beached in Bangladesh. While China has banned the import of waste domestically to improve its environment and citizens' quality of life, its shipping industry continues to offload toxic waste on vulnerable communities in countries like Bangladesh.

In 2024, 80% of vessels were dismantled under substandard conditions on Bangladeshi beaches. Tragically, nine workers died and 45 were injured across South Asian yards due to unsafe practices. Among these, one of the worst incidents occurred in Bangladesh, where an oil tanker explosion at SN Corporation's yard claimed six lives and critically injured six others.

The explosion on the oil tanker MT Suvarna Swarajya on September 7, 2024, in Bangladesh highlights the severe lack of international and national regulations, oversight, and labor rights protections in the shipbreaking industry, according to Human Rights Watch and the NGO Shipbreaking Platform. The blast killed six workers and left four critically injured. Workers have described the conditions as hazardous, with minimal safety measures provided by the management. A cutter reported buying his own protective gear while earning less than $1.50 per hour, below the minimum wage for shipbreaking workers. Despite repeated warnings, the Bangladesh interim government has failed to address S.N. Corporation's alleged negligence, leaving workers at ongoing risk.

Bangladesh's ship-breaking yards, located in Chattogram, saw record imports of 280 vessels in 2021, but numbers have fluctuated since then. Challenges such as a dollar crisis and declining sales have impacted the sector, according to Md Abu Taher, president of the Bangladesh Ship Breakers and Recyclers Association. The $6.5 billion steel re-rolling industry in Bangladesh relies on ship-breaking for only 10% of its steel. They are registering a downturn in business as public construction has declined.

The shipbreaking industry in Bangladesh has faced significant scrutiny for regulatory violations, particularly concerning environmental and labor protections. Despite being a major global hub for dismantling end-of-life vessels, the industry often operates under weak enforcement of both international and domestic regulationsDespite repeated warnings from the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA), some shipbreakers in Chattogram reportedly continue operations without proper clearance, including dismantling ships and dredging sand, further exacerbating regulatory violations.

Being in the informal sector, Bangladesh's ship recycling yards are also not always subject to controls or inspections for proper health and safety measures. And with many of the workers being under the age of 18, these jobs also violate the Minimum Age and Worst Forms of Child Labour Conventions of the ILO.

Due to the violation, the government agency is not only deprived of a lot of revenue every year, but also the biodiversity along the seashore is ruined. Toxic waste from dismantled ships, including hazardous materials like asbestos and heavy metals, is often improperly managed, leading to severe pollution of coastal areas and marine ecosystems.

The Hong Kong International Convention Bangladesh signed in 2023 for the safe and environmentally sound recycling of ships has made it mandatory for local shipyards to be green to be eligible to import scrap ships. Of the 50 shipyards Bangladesh has, only six have green certificates and 13 are in the process of becoming green, according to the data of the Bangladesh Ship Breakers and Recycling Association (BSBRA). As a result, most of Bangladesh's active shipyards need a huge amount of equipment to upgrade their yards to green shipyards.

As Bangladesh handles the majority of end-of-life vessels in South Asia, the global shipping industry is closely watching its ability to responsibly manage the global volume of ship recycling.

To claim the title of a safe and environmentally sound recycler, Bangladesh must address several critical issues including developing yards that meet all regulatory requirements, implementing effective downstream waste management solutions and ensuring that workers are well-trained and proactive about health, safety, and environmental issues. As the industry faces financial challenges, particularly due to declining ship imports and economic uncertainty amidst the political upheaval in the country, safety and environmental regulations must remain a priority.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/10/178586/,2025-03-10,50 Years of Saudi-Sri Lanka Diplomatic Relations,"By: Khalidh Rizwan

This year marks a historic milestone in the diplomatic relations between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka, celebrating fifty years of strong bilateral ties that have fostered economic, cultural, and humanitarian cooperation. Established in 1974, the diplomatic relationship between the two nations has flourished over the past five decades, strengthening in various domains, including trade, investment, labor, and development assistance. As Sri Lanka and Saudi Arabia commemorate this golden jubilee, it is an opportune moment to reflect on their shared history, key achievements, and the promising future that lies ahead.

The foundation of Saudi-Sri Lanka relations has been built on mutual respect, trust, and common interests. The Kingdom, recognized globally for its leadership in economic development, energy production, and humanitarian initiatives, has played a vital role in supporting Sri Lanka's progress. Similarly, Sri Lanka, with its strategic position in the Indian Ocean, rich cultural heritage, and skilled workforce, has been an important partner for Saudi Arabia, particularly in trade and labor cooperation. Over the years, both countries have demonstrated their commitment to strengthening ties through high-level diplomatic engagements, investment initiatives, and cultural exchanges.

Economic collaboration has been a cornerstone of this relationship. Saudi Arabia remains one of Sri Lanka's key trade partners in the Middle East, with bilateral trade witnessing steady growth in recent years. Sri Lankan exports to the Kingdom, particularly Ceylon Tea, have gained significant popularity among Saudi consumers, further reinforcing trade links between the two nations. Additionally, Sri Lanka exports a variety of other goods, including, spices, garments, and seafood, which have contributed to the strengthening of commercial ties. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia has extended its support to Sri Lanka through investments in infrastructure, tourism, and energy. The Saudi Fund for Development (SFD) has made a substantial contribution to Sri Lanka's economic and infrastructural development by financing major projects, including highways, water supply systems, and housing initiatives. Notable projects supported by the SFD include the construction of the Kinniya Bridge, the Kaluganga Development Project, the Badulla-Chenkaladi Highway, the Nuraicholai Housing Project, and the Epilepsy Hospital and Health Care Project. These developments have played a pivotal role in enhancing the country's infrastructure and overall economic growth.

A key aspect of Saudi-Sri Lanka relations is the labor migration and workforce exchange. Saudi Arabia has long been a favored destination for Sri Lankan workers, with over 500,000 Sri Lankans currently employed in various sectors, including healthcare, construction, and domestic services. The remittances sent by these workers contribute substantially to Sri Lanka's economy, supporting families and communities while strengthening the financial ties between the two nations. Recognizing the significance of this labor force, both governments have taken steps to enhance labor protections, ensuring better working conditions and social security for Sri Lankans in the Kingdom. The strong presence of Sri Lankan professionals in Saudi Arabia also highlights the level of trust and collaboration that has developed between the two nations over the decades.

Beyond trade and labor, Saudi Arabia's humanitarian contributions to Sri Lanka have been substantial. The King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSRelief) has provided significant assistance during times of crisis, particularly in response to natural disasters such as floods and landslides. Saudi Arabia has extended relief in the form of food aid, medical assistance, and financial support, demonstrating its solidarity with Sri Lanka in times of need. The Kingdom has also played a role in Sri Lanka's development sector, particularly in the fields of education and healthcare. The Kingdom has also established medical camps and programs, delivering essential treatments and healthcare services. KSRelief's cataract surgery programs in Walasmulla and Kathankudy areas can be pointed. Additionally, Saudi Arabia has played a pivotal role in Sri Lanka's development, particularly in the education and healthcare sectors.

Cultural and religious ties between the two nations have further deepened their diplomatic relationship. Every year, thousands of Sri Lankan Muslims embark on the sacred journey of Hajj and Umrah, strengthening the people-to-people connections between the two countries. Saudi Arabia has provided extensive support in facilitating these religious pilgrimages, ensuring that Sri Lankan pilgrims receive the necessary guidance and resources. Additionally, Saudi universities have offered scholarships to Sri Lankan students, allowing them to pursue higher education in Islamic studies and other academic fields. Such initiatives have contributed to the enhancement of intellectual and cultural exchanges, reinforcing the bond between the two nations.

Looking ahead, the future of Saudi-Sri Lanka relations holds immense promise. Both countries have expressed a strong commitment to expanding economic and diplomatic partnerships in alignment with Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 initiative, which seeks to diversify the Kingdom's economy and enhance global partnerships. Increased investments in Sri Lanka's infrastructure, tourism, and renewable energy sectors could pave the way for new opportunities that benefit both nations. The current Sri Lankan Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, His Excellency Amir Ajward, and the Saudi Ambassador to Sri Lanka, His Excellency Khalid Hamood Al-Qahtani, have demonstrated a strong commitment to this cause and have actively engaged in numerous initiatives. Their efforts are highly commendable. Furthermore, advancements in technology, artificial intelligence, and innovation present potential areas for collaboration, enabling Sri Lanka to benefit from Saudi expertise in these fields.

To commemorate this historic occasion, a grand event has been organized in Colombo under the leadership of His Excellency Khalidh Hamoodh Al-Qahthani, the Ambassador of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to Sri Lanka. The event will bring together diplomats, government officials, and media personalities. Additionally, a special logo marking the 50th anniversary of Saudi-Sri Lanka diplomatic relations will be officially launched, symbolizing the strength, unity, and progress of this enduring partnership.

Imagine a rural community in Sri Lanka where a once-thriving agricultural initiative suddenly comes to a halt. Farmers who relied on USAID-funded fertilizer support are left struggling, and a crucial supply chain begins to crumble.

This is one example of the tangible impact of USAID's withdrawal from Sri Lanka - a decision that extends far beyond policy debates and diplomatic maneuvering.

On January 20, 2025, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) officially announced its withdrawal from Sri Lanka and many other underdeveloped and developing countries, a move that has sparked widespread discussion.

While the official narrative cites financial realignment and anti-corruption measures, the decision raises pressing questions about its real motivations, the impact on local communities, and what this means for Sri Lanka's economic and policy landscape moving forward.

According to official statements, the USAID withdrawal was part of broader U.S. government efforts to reevaluate foreign aid priorities, ensuring alignment with the administration's goals. Former US President Donald Trump had previously ordered a freeze on USAID disbursements, citing corruption and inefficiency in fund allocation.

Additionally, the move fits into a larger pattern of US disengagement from international agreements, such as the withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, the UN Human Rights Council, and the Paris Climate Agreement.

However, Shakthi De Silva, an independent analyst, suggests that this decision is better understood in the context of the US shift toward offshore balancing. While USAID accounts for only a small fraction of US government spending, it has become an easy target for budget cuts, particularly when coupled with misinformation campaigns designed to appeal to domestic political bases.

De Silva also notes the irony of the situation: while corruption is often cited as a reason for the cut, many organizations reliant on USAID funding - including those engaged in fact-checking, policy formation, and support for marginalized communities - are now at risk of shutting down.

The consequences of USAID's departure are being felt most acutely by the people who depended on its programs. For example, the closure of MEND Media Empowerment for a Democratic Sri Lanka)'s initiatives under International Research & Exchanges Board (IREX), which had played a critical role in media development and capacity-building efforts.

Without USAID support, many similar organizations now face an uncertain future. Beyond the non-profit sector, vulnerable communities that received humanitarian assistance, especially in the wake of natural disasters, are now left with reduced support.

Farmers, women-led businesses, and educational programs in underserved areas are grappling with funding gaps that threaten their survival.

The 90-Day Dash: The Transition and Its Aftermath

According to Reuters, fewer than 300 staff will remain out of the agency's global workforce of over 10,000. The Asia bureau, which has been instrumental in projects across Sri Lanka, will be left with only eight employees. This massive downsizing has led to chaos, uncertainty, and the suspension of critical programs.

With all directly hired USAID employees put on leave and thousands of overseas personnel recalled, ongoing projects have ground to a halt. Humanitarian aid shipments are reportedly stuck in ports, with no clear plan for distribution.

Millions of dollars' worth of assistance - medical supplies, food aid, and disaster relief - risks being wasted due to bureaucratic paralysis and lack of manpower. Contracts with NGOs and local partners remain in limbo, with hundreds of internal contractors already laid off.

J.Brian Atwood, former USAID head, called the mass terminations ""outrageous,"" warning that the agency, which has saved tens of millions of lives globally, is being effectively dismantled. The situation has been further inflamed by high-profile figures like Elon Musk accusing USAID staff of criminal activity, adding to the climate of uncertainty and distrust.

For Sri Lanka, the sudden withdrawal means a funding vacuum for crucial development projects. Organizations that depended on USAID support for public health, climate resilience, and governance programs now face an uncertain future. As the 90-day period unfolds, the big question remains--what happens next, and who will step in to fill the void left behind?

Sri Lanka's Next Chapter: What Happens Now?

The immediate challenge for Sri Lanka is filling the funding void left by USAID's departure. According to Amar Gunatilleke, Vice Executive Chairman of the Marga Institute, Sri Lanka has historically benefited from diverse funding sources. These include the Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Bank, EU, and other bilateral donors such as Japan, Canada, and Australia.

The country also has access to climate finance mechanisms like the Green Climate Fund. However, he cautions that reliance on foreign aid and borrowing is not a sustainable long-term strategy.

Gunatilleke argues that Sri Lanka's economic future hinges on policy stability and internal revenue generation. He emphasizes the need for the government to widen the tax net without disproportionately burdening lower-income groups, increase direct taxation, and focus on value addition in agriculture and manufacturing.

However, policy discontinuity remains a major obstacle, as successive governments frequently alter economic strategies, undermining long-term development planning.

The American Perspective (And Why It Matters)

From a geopolitical standpoint, the USAID withdrawal is part of a broader trend of U.S. retrenchment from international commitments.

De Silva points out that, beyond Sri Lanka, this pattern includes the US withdrawal from UNESCO, the World Health Organization (WHO), and funding cuts to UN relief agencies. Such moves contribute to shifting global perceptions of the U.S. as an increasingly isolationist power, favoring short-term transactional gains over long-term strategic alliances.

For Sri Lanka, this withdrawal may signal a pivot toward alternative partners, such as China and India, for development assistance. However, the geopolitical strings attached to such engagements could significantly shape the nation's policy landscape.

Call to Action

The question now is: What next? Policymakers, civil society, and the private sector must collaborate to address the immediate fallout while also working toward long-term economic resilience.

Strengthening Domestic Policy: The Sri Lankan government should prioritize policy continuity and effective fiscal management to reduce dependency on external aid.

Bridging the Funding Gap: Local and international organizations can explore alternative funding streams, including public-private partnerships, impact investments, and crowdfunding models.

Research and Evidence-Based Policy: Amar Gunatilleke, for instance, underscores the importance of interdisciplinary research institutions working together to inform policy development. The government must take the lead in integrating economic, environmental, and social research into national planning efforts.

Citizen Engagement: Sri Lankan citizens and diaspora communities can play a role by supporting initiatives that promote self-sufficiency, advocating for transparent governance, and participating in dialogues on economic policy.

USAID's withdrawal from Sri Lanka is not just a diplomatic event; it is a moment of reckoning for the country's development trajectory. Whether this shift will lead to stronger domestic policy reforms or expose further vulnerabilities remains to be seen. What is clear, however, is that Sri Lanka must strategically navigate this transition, leveraging existing strengths while addressing critical gaps in governance, economic policy, and research-driven planning.

Recognizing the right of all individuals to a work environment free from violence and harassment based on gender equality, ILO Convention 190 on eliminating violence and harassment in the world of work was adopted on June 21, 2019, during the 108th session of the International Labour Conference in Geneva, Switzerland.

Every member state that ratifies this convention is obligated to commit to ensuring a work environment where all individuals can operate without violence and harassment.

The ratification of this convention further affirms the government's responsibility to uphold a world of work free from violence and harassment and requires necessary legal enforcement mechanisms to be implemented accordingly.

During the debate, it was highlighted that Sri Lanka's failure to take the necessary steps to ratify this convention has deprived all individuals, including women in Sri Lanka, of the opportunities and protections provided by it. (Newswire)"

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/10/taxi-conflicts-threaten-sri-lankas-tourism-sector/,2025-03-10,Taxi Conflicts Threaten Sri Lanka's Tourism Sector,"Sri Lanka's tourism sector is facing a growing challenge as tensions between local taxi mafias and app-based ride-hailing operators escalate. In the past twelve weeks, more than 30 incidents have been reported where local taxi groups allegedly harassed or obstructed app-based drivers for transporting passengers in certain areas. Several of these incidents included not just vandalism and causing damages to vehicles but also physical injuries sustained by app-based ride-hailing drivers. To worsen the situation, many of these incidents involved foreign tourists seeking the convenience of app-based transport solutions during their holiday. These incidents not only put drivers at risk but also threaten the country's reputation as a safe and welcoming destination for travelers.

Data from PickMe, Sri Lanka's leading ride-hailing platform, reveals several hotspots across the country where such conflicts have become common. Jiffry Zulfer, CEO of PickMe, has called for urgent action from law enforcement authorities to address these growing safety concerns and ensure the safety of all involved.

""This resistance toward app-operated transport technology services stems from a misguided belief that these platforms are taking business away from traditional operators,"" Zulfer explains. ""In reality, software-driven solutions help to bring tourists into their areas from far off locations, creating opportunities for local businesses. Traditional operators on the other hand, are most often not in a position to bring in tourists to their areas, due to limited accessibility and higher operational costs. It is therefore necessary to understand that instead of viewing technology driven transport as competition or even a threat, it is actually a system that makes the overall industry more efficient.""

App-based software platforms like PickMe are becoming the preferred choice for tourists due to their affordability, convenience, and transparency. Unlike traditional taxis, which often rely on negotiated, fixed, or meter-based pricing, app-based services use dynamic, data driven pricing resulting from the large efficient marketplaces they've created, with the advantage of technology. This ensures that drivers are available when needed while offering cost-effective rates for passengers.

For tourists, this pricing model is a game-changer that provides reliability, and safety in an unknown terrain. Knowing the fare in advance eliminates the need for negotiations or concerns about overcharging--issues frequently reported with local taxis. In Colombo, for example, traditional meter rates average LKR 80-90 per kilometer, but non-metered taxis often charge significantly more, particularly for unfamiliar travelers.

App-based services also excel in reliability and accessibility. Using GPS and sophisticated algorithms, platforms like PickMe ensure quick response times, averaging just three to seven minutes in urban areas. These services operate around the clock, covering both urban and suburban regions. In contrast, local taxis are often limited to specific areas and have lower availability during off-peak hours.

PickMe's research highlights that budget-conscious tourists increasingly prefer app-based transport solutions for their affordability and transparent pricing. Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels are amplifying this trend, with travelers sharing their positive experiences and highlighting the cost advantages of using app-based transport services.

Safety is another key factor influencing tourists' choice of transportation. Zulfer emphasises the advanced safety features built into PickMe's platform: ""Our technology allows passengers to share real-time ride information with family or friends. Additionally, we have a dedicated incident response team to facilitate resolution of issues such as lost items or disputes, providing immediate support when needed.""

Despite the rising popularity of app-based taxis, the CEO stresses the importance of coexistence between traditional taxis and digital platforms. While these two driver groups serve customers with different choices and operate within distinct ecosystems, both have a place in Sri Lanka's transport landscape. ""It must be understood that drivers who opt for app based technology platforms are citizens with the same rights as any other individual. They have the right to move and work freely across the country,"" Zulfer asserts.

However, PickMe surveys suggest significant room for improvement within the traditional taxi sector. A fair percentage of passengers using local taxis in Colombo report dissatisfaction with unclear pricing and inconsistent service quality. The growing preference for app-based ride-hailing platforms reflects a broader shift toward efficiency and digital integration in Sri Lanka's transportation sector. To ensure the continued growth of tourism, it is crucial for stakeholders to collaborate and address safety concerns while fostering an environment of coexistence.

As Zulfer concludes, ""A safe and thriving ecosystem benefits everyone--from tourists to drivers to local businesses. By addressing these issues, we can create a transportation system that supports the needs of all parties and strengthens Sri Lanka's appeal as a tourist destination."""

He will now be expected to lead the party into the next federal elections - which must be held before October, but could be called much earlier - where he is likely to face stiff competition from the Conservative party, which is currently leading in the polls.

While Carney will take over immediately as Liberal Party leader, Trudeau will remain as Canada's prime minister for an as-yet undisclosed transitional period while his successor settles in.

One of the biggest issues in Carney's immediate inbox will be the country's souring relations with the United States.

US President Donald Trump has repeatedly blamed Canada for illegal immigration into the US, threatened to turn Canada into a 51st state, and impose steep tariffs on Canadian imports, which the White House says is necessary to stem the flow of fentanyl over its borders.

In his first remarks following the result of the vote, Carney referenced the tensions with the US, saying his government would ""create new trading relationships with reliable trading partners."" He also vowed to keep retaliatory tariffs on the US ""until the Americans show us respect.""

""New threats demand new ideas and a new plan,"" he told the Liberal Party convention on Sunday.

Slamming the Trump administration's tariff plans, Carney said of the US president, ""He's attacking Canadian families, workers, and businesses and we cannot let him succeed and we won't.""

""In trade as in hockey, Canada will win,"" he added.

The ripple effects of the tense relations with the US have spread through Canadian society, with fans at NHL and NBA games in Canada even booing the US national anthem.

Carney will now face off with Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, who has previously been compared to Trump but now seeks to distance himself from the US leader, reiterating at a press conference earlier this week that he is ""not MAGA.""

At a rally on Sunday ahead of the Liberal vote, Poilievre delivered scathing remarks about Carney, a former governor of both the Bank of England and Bank of Canada, portraying him as a leader ill-equipped to deal with Trump.

""Working for Trudeau, Carney made Canada weaker and poorer; working for himself Carney made the United States richer and stronger,"" Poilievre said.

In his remarks following the results of the vote, Carney shot back at his conservative opponent.

""Donald Trump thinks he can weaken us with his plan to divide and conquer. Pierre Poilievre's plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,"" Carney said.

In recent weeks, the lead enjoyed by the Conservatives has narrowed as Trudeau, Carney and other Liberal Party figures have taken strong positions on the trade dispute with the US.

Trudeau has led the party for over a decade. He took the Liberals to power in 2015, promising ""sunny ways"" for Canada and was elected two more times, most recently in 2021, when he remained in power but lost his governing majority.

Trudeau's impending departure follows a series of political crises, rising economic discontent and the surprise resignation of his deputy prime minister and finance minister Chrystia Freeland - who was also in the race to succeed him.

In some of his last remarks as Liberal Party leader, Trudeau warned Sunday that Canadians face an ""existential challenge"" from the US.

""This is a nation-defining moment,"" he told the Liberal leadership convention in Ottawa, ahead of Carney being announced as his successor.

""And now, as Canadians face from our neighbor an existential challenge, an economic crisis, Canadians are showing exactly what we are made of,"" Trudeau said.

Plans for tackling Trump

Carney started his career in finance and in 2019 he was appointed UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance. Drawing on his background, Carney has made clean energy, climate policies and economic prosperity for Canada some of the central facets of his campaign

Raised in Edmonton, Alberta, when launching his campaign, Carney highlighted his role in helping the government address its debt during the 2008 financial crisis - and his role in navigating Britain's economy through Brexit.

Carney has zeroed in on bringing economic prosperity to Canada with the help of its natural resources like critical minerals and making Canada a leader in clean energy, stressing that being low-carbon will help Canada be more competitive. He has proposed shifting the financial burden of the carbon tax from consumers to big corporations and has said that under his leadership, the tax Canadian consumers and small businesses pay on fuel would be replaced with incentives to reduce carbon emissions.

Carney has not shied away from questions on how to tackle the Trump administration.

Since the US tariffs were announced last month, Carney has been an outspoken proponent of dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs that would hit the US hard but have minimal impact on Canada.

After Trump's tariff announcement and accusations of fentanyl trafficking from Canada into the US, Carney told CNN last month he was ""offended"" given Canada's long friendship with the US.

""We are a proud, independent nation. We view ourselves as the greatest country on Earth. We have been insulted on multiple occasions by senior members of the administration. We are not going to reciprocate in those insults."" (CNN)"

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/10/final-reaction-team-effort-has-carried-india-to-title-kohli/,2025-03-10,Final Reaction: Team effort has carried India to title - Kohli,"Virat Kohli is no stranger to winning major ICC tournaments and has put India's latest success in the ICC Men's Champions Trophy down to crucial contributions throughout the team during the tournament.

In a repeat of the 2000 final, India chased down their target of 252 with one over to spare after New Zealand posted 251 for seven from their 50 overs.

Captain Rohit Sharma made 76 at the top of the order to set up the win after India's spinners did a brilliant job of restricting their opponents with the bat.

For Kohli, an ICC Men's Champion Trophy winner in 2013, people performing in high-pressure situations is the main reason India won.

""These are the things, after playing for so long, you look forward to,"" he said. ""Being in situations where you are put under pressure, and you walk in, and you put your hand up.

""I think to win titles, which has been missing in the past, the whole team must step up in different games. And if you look at this tournament, over the course of five matches, everyone has put their hand up somewhere or another.""

Notable Indian performances during the tournament include Kohli's very own unbeaten hundred against Pakistan and his 84 in the semi-final against Australia.

Other valuable contributions include Varun Chakravarthy's five for 42 against New Zealand in the group stage, Shubman Gill's unbeaten 101 against Bangladesh and Mohammed Shami's bowling efforts throughout the entire tournament to finish as the joint-second highest wicket taker with nine scalps.

With 48 on the day to boost the Indian chase, Shreyas Iyer was another to underline his value with consistent impact.

Those efforts from his teammates are what pleased Kohli the most. He added: ""That is why we ended up winning this tournament. People have made such impactful knocks and produced such impactful spells, and it is only a collective effort that can win you a title.

""I am just so happy we were able to play as a unit and really enjoy ourselves. We have had such an amazing time as a team. It has been an amazing tournament for us.""

New Zealand's captain Mitchell Santner praised the way India's spinners bowled and pinpointed their bowling in the middle overs as a reason his side fell short of the score they wanted to post.

The quartet of Chakravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja combined to bowl 38 overs, taking five wickets at an economy rate of less than four between them.

""It was good bowling,"" Santner said when asked about why runs were hard to come by in parts of the game.

""We lost a couple of wickets after the powerplay and then they really got the squeeze on.

""It looked challenging to start with but credit to the way their spinners bowled, all four of them. They are world class bowlers, and they showed that again today.

""In the end, we were probably 20 under, maybe 25 under from what we wanted to get but we knew we had a total and we were going to fight and that is what we did."""

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/11/gunmen-hijack-train-in-pakistan/,2025-03-11,Gunmen hijack train in Pakistan,"A ""complex operation"" is ongoing in Pakistan's southwestern province of Balochistan, according to a security source, after a train carrying hundreds of passengers was hijacked by separatist militants, according to government and railway officials.

The train, known as the Jaffer Express, was stopped by the militants as it reached a tunnel on Tuesday afternoon, officials said. The train was on its way from Quetta in Balochistan, Pakistan's westernmost province, to the northwestern city of Peshawar.

""Armed individuals stopped Jaffer Express inside Tunnel No. 8 (in Bolan),"" Muhammad Kashif, Quetta Railways' controller told CNN.

The train, which departed from Quetta at 9 a.m. local time, consists of nine coaches and is carrying approximately 450 passengers, Kashif said.

The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant separatist group, has claimed responsibility for the attack. The BLA said in a statement seen by CNN that they had taken hostages from the train who will be ""executed"" if a security operation takes place.

On Tuesday evening, a security source told CNN that ""security forces have surrounded the terrorists and an exchange of fire is ongoing.""

The security source added that the militants were using ""women and children and shields.""

""Security forces will continue the operation until the last terrorist is eliminated,"" the source said.

Meanwhile, around 60 to 70 passengers had disembarked at the Panir Railway Station in Kachhi district, Kashif said late Tuesday. Kashif did not share more details about their release.

Earlier Tuesday, Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind told CNN that ""intense gunfire"" had been reported on the train. Access to the train, which was being held in Balochistan's mountainous region of Sibi, he said, was ""challenging.""

Junaid Ahmed, from Quetta, told CNN that his cousins were traveling on the Jaffar Express at the time of the incident.

""When I found out about the train incident, I lost contact with them. I came here (Quetta Railway Station), but officials here are saying that (they) are unable to make any contact too.""

The Balochistan government had directed emergency response efforts, Rind said, with a relief train sent to the scene.

Authorities are investigating the incident and are considering the possibility of a terrorist attack, Rind added.

On Friday, in a letter seen by CNN, Balochistan's Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) had issued a threat alert, regarding ""a planned attack"" by the BLA and asked ""all concerned authorities"" to ""take extraordinary precautions and safety measures to prevent any occurrence.""

An insurgency in Balochistan has been running for decades, but has gained traction in recent years since the province's deep-water Gwadar port was leased to China, the jewel in the crown of Beijing's ""Belt and Road"" infrastructure push in Pakistan.

Militants are angered by what they say is the state's exploitation of the region's rich mineral resources, with little of the proceeds filtering down to people in what remains Pakistan's poorest province. The port, often touted as ""the next Dubai,"" has become a security nightmare with persistent bombings of vehicles carrying Chinese workers, with many killed.

The BLA has been responsible for the deadliest attacks in Pakistan in the past year.

The Minister made these remarks during the first meeting of the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs for the Tenth Parliament, held under his chairmanship on 2025.03.08. The Deputy Minister Gamagedara Dissanayake was also present at this meeting.

The Minister made this statement when an inquiry was raised during the Committee regarding a temple constructed in the Jaffna Walikamam North area. He pointed out that he intends to visit the location for an inspection and expects to take a more just intervention accordingly.

Furthermore, the Minister stated that this time, with the support of the Department, the stock of 50 metric tons of dates received as a gift from the Saudi government was distributed very fairly among thousands of mosques. He also mentioned that he had received reports of irregularities in the past regarding the distribution of these dates and that, for the first time in history, the distribution was carried out in a fair and transparent manner.

A prolonged discussion was held regarding a request made on behalf of a group of workers who lost their employment from a private company established under the Central Cultural Fund for cultural conservation and construction activities. Officials stated that these individuals were temporarily employed. However, due to a court ruling instructing that they be reinstated and paid their salary in arrears, an amount of Rs. 55.9 million has to be paid by the Central Cultural Fund. It was also revealed that the Central Cultural Fund has obtained a writ order concerning this decision, temporarily halting the payment.

The Minister pointed out that due to the lack of proper guidance from officials and political authorities, the proper regularization of this group, recruited in 2012, has not been carried out for 13 years. He further stated that his government has to deal with past mistakes but is working more intelligently to resolve them.

The need for the registration of Christian priests was also discussed at this meeting. Officials stated that this longstanding issue was identified and that a process for registering Christian denominations, churches, and priests was initiated last year. Accordingly, relevant application forms have been published on the website.

The possibility of utilizing the income received by 'Basnayaka Nilame' and 'Kapu Mahaththaya' for the development of the country in some manner was also expressed as an opinion. The Minister stated that the temporary 'Basnayaka Nilame' appointed for the Sabaragamuwa Maha Saman Devalaya has disclosed that the temple's income from offerings for a month amounts to Rs. 6.2 million. He emphasized that this sector should therefore be reconsidered from a new perspective.

Attention was also drawn to the registration of Muslim mosques and Jummah mosques. It was revealed that for this year's Hajj pilgrimage, a quota of 3,500 pilgrims has been allocated for Sri Lanka and the cost per person was Rs. 2.1 million. Since a profit of nearly Rs. 300,000 per pilgrim is considered unfair, the necessity of providing further relief to the pilgrims was discussed.

The court was informed in this regard after Maithripala Sirisena had appeared in court today.

The Supreme Court judge bench then ordered Maithripala Sirisena's lawyer to present the details via a motion.

Maithripala Sirisena had arrived in court shortly after a notice was issued to him ordering him to show cause for his failure to settle the Rs. 01 million compensation to the victims of the Royal Park murder case.

Last year, the Supreme Court ordered Maithripala Sirisena to pay compensation as his decision to grant a Presidential Pardon to the convict of the Royal Park murder case had violated the fundamental rights of the victims.

Former President Maithripala Sirisena was ordered to settle the compensation within one month of the court ruling.

President Dissanayake said 11 economically significant projects that were previously halted by the Japanese government and 76 projects that had been suspended by the Chinese government will be restarted.

The President made these remarks while attending the 26th Anniversary of the Chamber of Young Lankan Entrepreneurs (COYLE) held in Colombo yesterday.

President Dissanayake stated that the government is committed to providing the necessary support to secure a share for Sri Lankan entrepreneurs in the global market.

He highlighted that the government has a strong strategic plan to facilitate access to international markets by integrating diplomats and entrepreneurs into a unified process.

The President further stated that this year's budget has been designed to create a more dynamic and flexible economy, replacing the stagnant economic conditions of the past.

Noting that allowing greater economic mobility would enable the country to achieve a certain level of development, he said accordingly, the budget has been structured in a way that does not cause major economic shocks.

The President also emphasized that the current government remains sensitive to economic decision-making, ensuring that policies do not place an unbearable burden on the Sri Lankan Rupee.

He also acknowledged that certain decisions had to be made in alignment with recommendations from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

President Dissanayake revealed that the current government has taken the necessary and correct decisions to restore confidence in an economy where trust had previously collapsed. As a result, the country, which was officially declared bankrupt, has now been able to overcome its state of bankruptcy.

The President emphasized that his government ensures every rupee spent is treated as a public trust and utilized with the highest level of responsibility.

The current government has already taken significant steps to provide economic stability, creating a more secure environment for investors. As a result, the government has been able to facilitate large-scale investments in renewable energy, including the construction of a 50-megawatt wind power plant in Mannar, he said.

The President also highlighted that a business-friendly environment has been established where investors can operate without having to pay any commissions.

Furthermore, he stated that the government is prepared to empower young entrepreneurs, not only within Sri Lanka but also by providing them with the strength to expand into international markets.

""We have built the strongest and most politically stable administration in Sri Lanka,"" President Dissanayake said, pointing out that, in past parliaments, it was common for MPs representing the opposition to later join the government and vice versa.

However, he emphasized that such a situation does not exist in the current parliament, where there is a clear distinction between the government and the opposition, describing this as a strong example of political stability.

President Dissanayake also remarked that a model political system has now been established in Sri Lanka, assuring that, by the end of the current administration's tenure, there would be no room for a destructive political climate to re-emerge. (Newswire)"

According to CBC News, the double shooting had taken place inside a Markham home that police say was targeted and shot at multiple times in the past year.

The shooting happened around 6:30 a.m. Friday at a residence on Solace Road near Highway 48 and Castlemore Avenue, York Regional Police say.

Officers who responded to the shooting found the two adults with gunshot wounds, according to Const. Kevin Nebrija.

The female victim has been identified as 20-year-old Nilakshi Raguthas. Police say she was taken to a trauma centre and pronounced dead a short time later.

The other victim, a 26-year-old man, was taken to hospital with serious but non-life threatening injuries, Nebrija said.

A German Shepherd dog was also fatally shot during the attack, Nebrija said.

Police say two suspects were seen speeding away from the home in a newer-model, black, four-door Acura TLX sedan.

""This is being investigated as a targeted shooting. And we can confirm that this house has been targeted multiple times in the past,"" Nebrija told reporters at the scene.

Police were previously sent to the home five times since 2018, including three calls last year, he added. Several of those incidents involved suspects shooting at the residence from a distance, Nebrija said.

The house was shot at once in February 2024 and twice the next month. Shortly after that, police held a town hall meeting with residents, Nebrija said.

No arrests have been made in those previous cases.

The homicide unit has taken over the investigation but it is too early to speculate on a possible motive for the slaying, he added.

Police say the case marks York Region's third homicide of the year.

They are appealing for anyone with information or security camera video that could assist investigators to contact York police or leave an anonymous tip with Crime Stoppers. (CBC)"

Duterte was taken into custody on Tuesday at Manila airport upon his arrival from Hong Kong, according to the Philippine government, which received the ICC request through the international police agency, Interpol.

""Upon his arrival, the prosecutor general served the ICC notification for an arrest warrant to the former president for the crime of crime against humanity,"" the government said in a statement.

""He's now in the custody of authorities,"" it said.

The charge of ""crimes against humanity"" is related to Duterte's brutal anti-drugs drive. The so-called ""war on drugs"", while Duterte was in office from 2016-2022, deprived suspects of ""due process under the law"", according to the arrest warrant, and resulted in the deaths of thousands of people, including children.

In a statement, Human Rights Watch (HRW) described Duterte's arrest as ""a critical step for accountability in the Philippines"".

""His arrest could bring victims and their families closer to justice and sends the clear message that no one is above the law. The Marcos government should swiftly surrender him to the ICC,"" said Bryony Lau, HRW's deputy Asia director.

Defending his actions amid reports of his possible arrest, Duterte had previously said that he ""did everything...for the Filipino people"".

""If it's really my fate in life, that's OK, I will accept it. There's nothing I can do about it. If I'm arrested, if I'm jailed, so be it,"" he had said.

Over the course of Duterte's six-year presidency, more than 7,000 people were killed in official anti-drug operations, according to police records.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/11/apple-preparing-for-a-major-software-overhaul-bloomberg/,2025-03-11,Apple preparing for a major software overhaul - Bloomberg,"Apple is preparing one of the most dramatic software overhauls in the company's history, aiming to transform the interface of the iPhone, iPad and Mac for a new generation of users.

The revamp - due later this year - will fundamentally change the look of the operating systems and make Apple's various software platforms more consistent, according to people familiar with the effort. That includes updating the style of icons, menus, apps, windows and system buttons.

As part of the push, the company is working to simplify the way users navigate and control their devices, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the project hasn't been announced. The design is loosely based on the Vision Pro's software, they said.

Apple is betting that a breakthrough new interface can help spur demand after a sluggish stretch. Its revenue slowed following a pandemic-era surge in technology spending, and growth is only returning gradually. Apple's iPhone - its biggest moneymaker - suffered a surprise dip in sales during the most recent holiday season.

The changes are coming as part of iOS 19 and iPadOS 19 - code-named ""Luck"" - and macOS 16, which is dubbed ""Cheer."" They go well beyond a new design language and aesthetic tweaks. The software will mark the most significant upgrade to the Mac since the Big Sur operating system in 2020. For the iPhone, it will be the biggest revamp since iOS 7 in 2013.

An Apple spokesperson declined to comment.

The updates are poised to be a highlight at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in June - and could help distract from the company's tumultuous push into artificial intelligence. Last week, Apple indefinitely delayed its AI upgrades for the Siri digital assistant, confirming a Bloomberg News report that the enhancements were in jeopardy.

A key goal of the overhaul is to make Apple's different operating systems look similar and more consistent. Right now, the applications, icons and window styles vary across macOS, iOS and visionOS. That can make it jarring to hop from one device to another.

Still, Apple is stopping short of merging its operating systems - a step other tech giants have taken. The company believes it can make better Macs and iPads by keeping their operating systems separate. Another benefit for Apple is it encourages consumers to buy both devices, rather than getting by with one.

Apple's visionOS, meanwhile, was developed for its mixed-reality headset - a device that melds virtual and augmented reality. That product hasn't sold well since its debut last year, but the software has innovative touches that will ultimately spread to other devices.

VisionOS differs from iOS and macOS in the use of circular app icons, a simplified approach to windows, translucent panels for navigation, and a more prominent use of 3D depth and shadows. But the Vision Pro's more immersive experience - and use of a hand-gesture interface - means that some elements won't apply to the 2D world of iOS and macOS.

The upgrade has become a major focus for Apple's software engineering organisation, as well as the user interface team within the company's larger design group.

Software design is overseen by Alan Dye, a long-time Apple executive who previously held stints at fashion brands. Over a decade ago, he was tapped by design chief Jony Ive to help craft the Apple Watch's operating system, as well as iOS 7.

With Ive's departure in 2019, Dye gained in prominence at Apple. He now oversees more than 300 people - a group that determines how software looks and operates and even the sound it makes. Dye reports to chief operating officer Jeff Williams and works alongside Molly Anderson, the executive in charge of industrial and hardware design.

The departure of Ive, a legendary design guru, is still felt at the company. Many designers followed him out the door in recent years, including some that joined his firm, LoveFrom. The design department also has suffered from morale problems, with some employees complaining about heavy-handed management and a seemingly less creative culture.

Creating simple, intuitive interfaces has been a hallmark of Apple for more than four decades - dating back to the Mac. But design innovations also can spark backlash.

The company now has more than 2 billion devices in use around the world, and people rely on them to work, communicate and play. Even when Apple revamped its Photos app last year, legions of users complained. With the entire operating systems changing, the stakes are much higher. - Bloomberg"

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/12/elon-musks-starlink-to-launch-in-india-7-key-facts/,2025-03-12,Elon Musk's Starlink to launch in India : 7 key facts,"Starlink's Jio-Airtel Deal: Here are the ins and outs of Starlink, a division of Elon Musk's SpaceX that has signed strategic deals with Airtel and Jio in India.

Elon Musk-owned SpaceX has struck key business deals with two of India's telecom giants, setting the stage for the long-anticipated entry of its satellite internet service, Starlink, into the country's lucrative telecom market.

Within hours of each other, Bharti Airtel and Reliance Industries' Jio Platforms announced that they have signed separate, non-exclusive agreements with SpaceX to bring Starlink to India.

The announcements did not go into specifics of the deals other than the fact that Starlink equipment will be offered through the two telcos' retail outlets, with Jio also stating it will establish a ""mechanism to support customer service installation and activation"" of Starlink services.

Both agreements are subject to SpaceX receiving its own authorisations to sell Starlink in India. With the deals making headlines and sparking buzz around the launch of Starlink in India, here are the ins and outs of the unique and widely popular satellite internet service.

1. Starlink users just need a clear view of the sky

Starlink is able to provide reasonably high-speed Internet to any user with a clear view of the sky through its constellation of satellites.
Unlike traditional satellite providers, which often struggle with speed and latency, Starlink uses its fleet of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites that can communicate with one another to deliver high-speed internet with low latency.
Starlink also differs from decades-old satellite connections as its LEO constellation comprises satellites that are just a few hundred kilometres away from Earth's surface. LEO satellite systems require antennae in order to track the signals from the satellites as they pass overhead.

2. Starlink has over 7,000 satellites in orbit

In 2024, the company reported surpassing 4.6 million users worldwide with around 1.4 million subscribers in the US.
While Starlink has the largest LEO constellation in the world, Jeff Bezos's Amazon plans to launch 3,236 satellites with Project Kuiper. Meanwhile, Eutelsat OneWeb currently features more than 630 satellites along 12 synchronised orbital planes. SpaceX also plans to expand its megaconstellation of satellites to 42,000.

3. Starlink provides coverage to over 125 markets around the world

Starlink is available in the majority of North America, South America, Australia, and parts of Europe. Last month, Bhutan became the first South Asian country where Starlink is operating legally.
However, it does not serve customers in China, which is seeking to build its own capacity through satellite megaprojects.

4. Starlink can be used on boats

For boats, Starlink has a $250 monthly plan that comes with 50GB of data and a much pricier plan that costs $1000 per month and gives you 1TB of data.
If you want to use Starlink on boats, it costs $2500 for the hardware only, with optional accessories like a pipe adaptor and Gen 3 Wi-Fi router priced at $120 and $199 respectively. But if you don't want to spend so much money, the standard kit works on boats but only if you are stationary.
In December 2024, police in Andaman and Nicobar Islands seized a Starlink dish from drug smugglers who were allegedly transporting methamphetamine worth Rs 36,000 crore on a fishing trawler.

5. Starlink poses environmental concerns

A recent study found that Starlink's second-generation satellites -- which currently account for less than a third of the network -- emit unintended electromagnetic radiation (UEMR) at levels 32 times brighter than its first-generation satellites.
Scientists have also raised alarms about their serious threat to the environment.In January this year, about 120 SpaceX Starlink satellites burnt up in Earth's atmosphere. These satellite re-entries result in the release of aluminium oxide particles that could, in the long run, damage the Earth's ozone layer.

6. Starlink can work with third-party routers

Starlink satellite internet service can work with a different, third-party Wi-Fi router, according to a report by PC Mag.
While the Starlink router that comes with the dish is reportedly sufficiently powerful to provide basic Wi-Fi connectivity, users who are interested in setting up a more sophisticated networking solution can opt for gaming routers or mesh routers in order to expand the network coverage, the report said.

7. Starlink can struggle with capacity, speed in high-demand areas

Starlink promises to offer internet services at faster speeds and lower latency than fixed line broadband service providers. However, experts are concerned whether the SpaceX division can keep up with rising user demand.
In the US, Starlink has so far failed to reach 100 megabits per second download and 20Mbps upload speeds -- which is the benchmark set by the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a service to be defined as broadband, according to a report by CNET. (Indian Express)"

'Salam Ramadan', is a citywide, social initiative by the Western Provincial Council, to address the gaps in awareness and understanding in the country about the religion of Islam, the Holy Month of Ramadan, and the cultural and traditional practices of the Sri Lankan Muslim Community.

Conceptualized as a hybrid festival of food, culture and tradition, associated with the Holy Month of Ramadan and the Sri Lankan Muslim community, the initiative is in keeping with the Government of Sri Lanka's vision of building unity through celebrating cultural diversity and strengthening community ties.

To that end, the festival would enhance the Ramadan experience by fostering a festive atmosphere, greater community participation, economic engagement, and interfaith understanding, similar to how religious and cultural festivals of other communities in Sri Lanka are celebrated in the country.

Addressing the media yesterday, speaking on the vision behind this initiative, the Chairman of the Ramadan Task Force, Rizan Nazeer, stated, ""Ramadan is more than just a month of fasting. There is so much more to share with our fellow Sri Lankans in terms of cultural  practices, traditions, food and so on.""

""When you take into account that the Sri Lankan Muslim community comprises four ethnic groups, namely the Moors, Memons, Malays and Dawoodi Bohras; each of whom has a vibrant tapestry of cultural norms that make them unique from the other, the potential for bridge-building through a festival of this nature is immense,"" Nazeer added.

The 'Salam Ramadan' campaign is scheduled to launch from 21 to 31 March 2025 at Green Path, Colombo. (Newswire)"

""Ukraine is ready to start talking and stop shooting,"" said Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, after more than seven hours of negotiations in that city between high-level American and Ukrainian delegations.

Both U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to conclude ""as soon as possible a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine's critical mineral resources,"" according to a joint statement by the two nations' governments.

Zelenskyy in a statement said the planned ceasefire would halt all hostilities, ""not just for missiles, drones and bombs, not just in the Black Sea, but along the entire front line.""

""Ukraine welcomes this proposal. We see it as a positive step, and we are ready to take it,"" Zelenskyy said. ""The United States must now persuade Russia to do the same. If Russia agrees, silence will take effect immediately.""

""Today, we made an offer that the Ukrainians have accepted, which is to enter into a ceasefire and into immediate negotiations to end this conflict in a way that's enduring and sustainable and accounts for their interests, their security, their ability to prosper as a nation,"" Rubio said.

""And hopefully we'll take this offer now to the Russians, and we hope that they'll say yes, that they'll say yes to peace,"" Rubio said. ""The ball is now in their court.""

The 32-year-old has been granted refugee status in New Zealand.

She said a prominent MP's associates suggested she should have sex with him to further her career and now held a grudge against her, after a friend posted on social media about the incident.

He ran in presidential elections in 2020 in Sri Lanka, but did not succeed.

After her brother-in-law died in a motorcycle crash, a note was found on his coffin at his funeral, saying she would be next to be killed.

She received two threatening phone calls and a motorbike was ridden directly towards her at speed.

The immigration and protection tribunal heard that a group of men firing gunshots gathered around her house demanding she leave politics, the day before regional elections in 2018.

The tribunal said country sources suggested that harassment of women in politics in Sri Lanka was escalating.

""The appellant has told the tribunal that she would not dare to become involved in politics again in Sri Lanka for fear for her life. She states that entering politics was 'the worst decision of my life' and that she 'lost herself' and feels 'dead inside'.""

She feared the politician would kill her if she returned to Sri Lanka in 'revenge against her for destroying his political career'.

Her parents' house caught fire in 2022, which she believed may also have been his doing by capitalising on a period of unrest.

A friend's evidence summarised what happened: ""She has been prevented from pursuing a political career owing to threats from various persons in opposing parties and from [the MP], who attempted to force her into a sexual relationship with him. A friend recorded this matter publicly on Facebook and the post received over a hundred views before the friend was forced to take it down. (RNZ)"

The Prime Minister's Office strongly condemns the fraudulent cryptocurrency scam advertisements currently being promoted on Facebook and Instagram, falsely featuring Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya an other prominent Sri Lankan figures.

These deceptive ads, operated by foreign entities, aim to mislead the public and exploit the trust associated with well-known personalities.

It has come to our attention that these scam campaigns, originating from fraudulent accounts based in Lithuania, are actively targeting Facebook users in Sri Lanka.

Similar ads have recently featured Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath, Minister of Science and Technology MP Chrishantha Abeysena, and well-known journalists Amantha Perera and Sunanda Deshapriya, as well as other Sri Lankan public figures in previous instances.

We urge citizens to exercise extreme caution when encountering online advertisements promoting cryptocurrency investments, particularly those falsely claiming endorsements from government officials and public figures. No government official or ministry has endorsed any cryptocurrency investment scheme.

Additionally, despite reports and removal requests, variations of these scams continue to appear on social media platforms, highlighting serious concerns about the inability of Facebook to curb fraudulent advertising effectively.

We call upon Meta (Facebook's parent company) to take immediate and stronger action to prevent the spread of these deceptive campaigns and safeguard Sri Lankan users from financial fraud.

How to Protect Yourself:

• Do not engage with or click on suspicious ads claiming endorsements from public figures.

• Report fraudulent advertisements directly on Facebook and Instagram.

• Verify all financial opportunities through legitimate sources before investing.

The Prime Minister's Office remains committed to protecting the public from online fraud and will continue working with relevant authorities to address this growing issue. We urge media organizations and digital platforms to act responsibly in curbing the spread of misinformation and scams.

The 54-year-old faced trial over allegations he participated in the supply of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, over an April 2021 introduction he made between his cocaine dealer and partner's brother, Marino Sotiropoulos.

On the Crown's case, the introduction amounted to setting up a drug supply because the dealer and Mr Sotiropoulos allegedly went on to organise a $330,000 deal for 1 kilogram of cocaine.

A jury in the NSW District Court heard that while MacGill's involvement was limited to the introduction, the dealer also took part in two other alleged supplies, including one in which he handed over a vacuum-sealed bag of A4 paper instead of cash to Mr Sotiropoulos's associates.

The dealer, referred to during proceedings as ""Person A"" for legal reasons, gave evidence in closed court and Crown Prosecutor Gabrielle Steedman invited jurors to accept his account, which she said was supported by other records before the court.

MacGill pleaded not guilty and his defence lawyers cast doubt on Person A's credibility, arguing his conduct was deceptive and dishonest in multiple respects.

It took the jury about seven hours of deliberations to find MacGill not guilty of the charge of knowingly taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug.

But he was found guilty of an alternative charge of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug -- without the large commercial supply element.

MacGill made little reaction in the dock when he learned the verdict and left court without making any comment.

MacGill spent hundreds on cocaine weekly

Person A's ""rip off"" with the fake bag of cash involved an alleged deal worth $660,000 for 2 kilograms of cocaine and was linked to the kidnapping of MacGill, who said he was threatened before being driven to Bringelly by a group of men, stripped, assaulted and held against his will.

The ex-cricketer stepped into the witness box in his own defence, denying any facilitation of drug supply and telling jurors his ""sole role in this debacle was to introduce Person A with Marino"".

MacGill conceded he was a recreational cocaine user -- but not an addict -- at the time, spending between $400 to $600 a week, occasionally up to $800, on the drug.

The Crown alleged MacGill told Person A his brother-in-law could ""get good gear"", which he denied during cross-examination.

He insisted the introduction, in the car park of his Neutral Bay restaurant Aristotle's, took mere seconds and was not ""setting up anything"" nor preceded by him acting as a go-between for negotiations, as alleged by the Crown.

The former spinner referred to Mr Sotiropoulos as a ""dickhead"" and ""wannabe"" who would constantly ""waffle"" in the restaurant about drugs and being ""hard"".

The court heard Person A was not charged over the alleged drug supplies, but he was charged over items found at his granny flat including an unauthorised gun and ammunition, cocaine, 15 phones, three sets of scales, resealable bags and nearly $300,000 in cash.

He remains on parole after receiving a 50 per cent discount on his sentence, which was set at three years and three months, with a non-parole period of 20 months.

MacGill's case is expected to return to court in May for sentence proceedings. (ABC)"

This year it falls today the 13th of March 2025. Let's delve into the history and significance of this crucial day:

History of World Kidney Day:

Significance of World Kidney Day:

Your kidneys are vital organs that perform many functions to keep your blood clean and chemically balanced. They filter about 200 liters of blood a day, remove waste products and excess fluid, regulate your blood pressure and electrolytes, produce hormones and activate vitamin D. However, your kidneys can be damaged by various factors, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, infections, injuries etc. Therefore, it is important to take care of your kidneys and adopt some healthy habits to protect them. Here are some tips to keep your kidneys healthy:

Keep active and fit: Regular exercise can help lower your blood pressure, reduce your risk of chronic kidney disease, and improve your cardiovascular health. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week, such as brisk walking, cycling, swimming, or dancing. Avoid sitting for long periods and take breaks to stretch and move around.

Drink enough water: Drinking enough water can help your kidneys flush out toxins and waste products from your body. It can also prevent kidney stones and urinary tract infections. The amount of water you need depends on your age, weight, activity level, and climate, but generally, you should aim for about 1.5 to 2 liters of water per day. However, if you have kidney disease or other health conditions, you may need to limit your fluid intake. Consult your doctor for the best advice on your hydration needs.

Eat a balanced diet: Eating a balanced diet can help you maintain a healthy weight, control your blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and prevent kidney damage. Choose foods that are low in salt, sugar, and saturated fat, and high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats in your meals. Avoid processed foods, fast foods, and snacks that are high in sodium, phosphorus, and potassium, as they can harm your kidneys. If you have kidney disease or other health conditions, you may need to follow a specific diet plan. Consult your doctor or a dietitian for the best advice on your nutritional needs.

Limit alcohol and caffeine: Alcohol and caffeine can dehydrate your body, increase your blood pressure, and interfere with your kidney function. They can also worsen some kidney problems, such as kidney stones, infections, or inflammation. Therefore, it is advisable to limit your intake of alcohol and caffeine, and opt for water, herbal teas, or low-fat milk instead. If you do drink alcohol or caffeine, do so in moderation and drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.

Quit smoking: Smoking can damage your blood vessels, reduce blood flow to your kidneys, and increase your risk of kidney cancer. It can also worsen other kidney problems, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease. Therefore, quitting smoking can improve your kidney health and your overall well-being. If you need help to quit smoking, talk to your doctor or a counselor, or join a support group. You can also use nicotine patches, gums, or lozenges to ease your withdrawal symptoms.

Monitor your blood pressure: High blood pressure can damage your kidneys and lead to kidney failure. It can also cause other complications, such as heart attack, stroke, or vision loss. Therefore, it is important to monitor your blood pressure regularly and keep it under control. The ideal blood pressure for most adults is below 120/80 mmHg. If your blood pressure is higher than that, you may need to take medication, change your lifestyle, or both. Consult your doctor for the best advice on your blood pressure management.

Check your blood sugar: High blood sugar can damage your kidneys and lead to diabetic kidney disease. It can also cause other complications, such as nerve damage, eye problems, or cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is important to check your blood sugar regularly and keep it within a healthy range. The ideal blood sugar for most adults is below 140 mg/dL after meals and below 100 mg/dL before meals. If your blood sugar is higher than that, you may need to take medication, change your diet, or both. Consult your doctor for the best advice on your blood sugar management.

Get regular check-ups: Getting regular check-ups can help you detect any kidney problems early and prevent them from getting worse. Your doctor may perform some tests to check your kidney function, such as urine tests, blood tests, or imaging tests. These tests can measure your creatinine level, glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, or kidney size and structure. Depending on your test results, your doctor may prescribe some treatments, such as medication, dialysis, or transplantation. You may also need to follow up with your doctor regularly to monitor your kidney health.

By following these tips, you can keep your kidneys healthy and prevent or delay kidney disease. Remember, your kidneys are essential for your health, so take good care of them. If you have any questions or concerns about your kidney health, talk to your doctor or a kidney specialist. They can provide you with more information and guidance on how to protect your kidneys.

Speaking in Parliament, the Prime Minister stated that no rule had been imposed but emphasized that school systems should not be used for politics. She reiterated that there was no such restriction and dismissed media reports suggesting otherwise as incorrect.

She was responding to a question from Opposition MP D.V. Chanaka, who asked how government parliamentarians were attending school events despite the supposed ban imposed by the Prime Minister in her capacity as Education Minister.

In response, she insisted that no such ban existed and accused the media of misreporting her statement. However, on September 26 last year, a press release from the Prime Minister's Office stated that during a meeting with Education Ministry officials, the Prime Minister had instructed them to stop inviting politicians to school functions.

Ranil Wickremesinghe's special statement comes after Leader of the House, Minister Bimal Rathnayake tabled the 'Batalanda Commission Report' in Parliament today.

Addressing the Parliament, Minister Rathnayake said the report will be forwarded to the Attorney General for advice on necessary action and that President Anura Kumara Dissanayake will appoint a special committee to study and make recommendations on the report.

The Batalanda Commission Report concerns the alleged human rights violations, murders and disappearances that occurred during the 1988/90 period.

Upon assuming office as President, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga established the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on September 21, 1995, to investigate these incidents.

Known as the Batalanda Commission, it was tasked with examining the illegal detention, torture, assassination and disappearances of individuals at the Batalanda Housing Scheme.

After nearly three years of gathering evidence, the commission submitted its report to President Kumaratunga in 1998, but the recommendations of the Batalanda Commission Report were never implemented.

The Batalanda Commission Report was brought to the spotlight once again, following former President Ranil Wickremesinghe's recent controversial interview with international media, Al Jazeera. (Newswire)"

Writing for Time Magazine, Audrey Phoon has described the Pekoe Trail as offering hikers an intimate look at Sri Lanka's diverse landscape and tea-entwined history.

""Up in the Sri Lankan highlands, a 19th-century transport network for tea is now conveying adventurers to remote communities and businesses. The 186-mile Pekoe Trail--completed last March and named for the high-grade black tea produced on many Sri Lankan estates--is the country's first long-distance walking path, linking thousands of colonial-era dirt roads and railway tracks built by the British for exporting tea.

Though local companies have led trekking tours along parts of the route for years, this is the first time all 22 sections have been connected as a single trail, an initiative led by Sri Lanka-based sustainability consultant Miguel Cunat and funded by the European Union and the U.S. Agency for International Development.

For hikers, the path offers an intimate look at Sri Lanka's diverse landscape and tea-entwined history: it unfurls from the mist-cloaked Hanthana mountains near Kandy, through tea plantations, eucalyptus forests, tiny villages and the holy peak of Sri Pada, to Nuwara Eliya, the country's tea capital.

A new app highlights nearby landmarks, segment details, emergency information, and more. Each stage takes about three to six hours to hike, depending on its difficulty, and traversing the entire route can take weeks.

Charming stays--including Teardrop Hotels' contemporary-chic bungalows and Uga Escapes' newly launched Halloowella, a six-suite estate formerly owned by a British army major that has been redesigned by celebrated Sri Lankan architect Channa Daswatte--ensure that hikers are well-fed and rested along the way,"" says Audrey Phoon, describing Sri Lanka's Pekoe Trail.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/14/obesity-among-married-men-findings-of-new-study/,2025-03-14,Obesity among married men : Findings of new study,"Being married triples the risk of men becoming obese, research suggests.

The chance of piling on the pounds increased for both sexes after marriage, however.

Women's risk of being overweight was 39% higher - and men's 62% - compared with unmarried couples.

But married men were 3.2 times more likely to be classed as technically obese than their unmarried counterparts, according to the study.

This finding wasn't mirrored in females, which the Polish researchers said could be because women who are obese ""are more often stigmatised"" by society.

Dr Alicja Cicha-Mikolajczyk, from Warsaw's National Institute of Cardiology, suggested women ""cannot accept living with obesity"" and are more likely to take action to lose weight.

In the UK, the NHS generally classes obese people as having a body mass index (BMI) of above 30, and being overweight is associated with a BMI of 25-30.

However, the measure (which looks only at height and weight) has been criticised by some as over simplistic.

The study - which looked at 2,405 Polish people, typically aged 50 - also found getting older increased the risk of becoming heavier in both sexes.

Each extra year increased the risk of being overweight by 3% in men and 4% in women; and the risk of obesity by 4% in men and 6% in women.

Depression or poor health knowledge also had a significant impact on the risk of women becoming obese - but this wasn't found in men.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/14/what-is-the-batalanda-report/,2025-03-14,What is the Batalanda Report?,"The Batalanda Commission was established to investigate allegations of unlawful detention, torture, and extrajudicial killings at the Batalanda Housing Scheme in Sri Lanka between 1988 and 1990, during the JVP insurgency.

The Batalanda report resurfaced recently following former President Ranil Wickremesinghe's interview with Al Jazeera, where he was questioned about the torture allegations.

Leader of the House Bimal Rathnayake, tabling the report in Parliament today, noted that despite its significance, the Batalanda report had never been presented in Parliament since its completion decades ago.

""As the main accused revealed during the Al Jazeera interview, it was never tabled in Parliament"" he said.

Commissioned by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the inquiry focused on human rights violations in an unofficial government detention centre. The Commission, chaired by Justice D. Jayawickrama with N.E. Dissanayake, was appointed by a presidential warrant in 1995. The tenure of the Commission was extended on multiple occasions.

""A final Batalanda Commision report and relevant material was handed over to the Director of the National Archives in 1998, May 20th,"" Rathanayake revealed in Parliament.

Upon instructions of President Kumaratunga, 750 printed copies of the report including Sinhala and Tamil copies had been printed, he added.

""The astounding fact is that not one of the 750 printed copies were forwarded to the Attorney General. Therefore those who called for this report not only failed to implement the recommendations, but merely used it as a political tool during elections,"" Rathnayake charged.

""It is evident that the report should have been handed over to then-President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga before May 1998. However, the reason she did not forward a copy to the Attorney General was unclear at the time--but today, those reasons are clear as day,"" Rathnayake said.

Minister Rathnayake said that the Cabinet and President Anura Kumara Dissanayake have decided to seek the Attorney General's advice on the Batalanda Commission Report.

How does the Batalanda report implicate Ranil Wickremesinghe?

Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe was implicated in the Batalanda Commission Report due to his role in the allocation of houses at the Batalanda Housing Scheme, which were later used as detention and torture chambers.

As then Minister of Industries and Scientific Affairs, he directed the Liquidator of the State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation to allocate these houses to police officers, with the commission concluding that he ""abused his authority"" in doing so.

Additionally, House A2/2 was noted as his circuit bungalow from 1983 to 1994, with security officers occupying surrounding houses.

House B2, which Wickremesinghe reportedly used as his office, was identified by a witness as a torture chamber.

The commission found that Wickremesinghe chaired unauthorized meetings with police officers at Batalanda and gave ""directions pertaining to the conduct of the Police relating to anti-subversive activity,"" interfering in law enforcement operations.

Testimonies, including that of his caretaker Vincent Fernando, suggested he had knowledge of detainees being held at Batalanda, with the commission concluding that, given the proximity of these activities to his residence, he ""must have known"" about the torture chambers.

Furthermore, Wickremesinghe was linked to Sunil Perera also known as 'Gonawala Sunil', a known criminal and UNP regional leader, who had connections to violent incidents.

The commission ultimately found him ""indirectly responsible for the maintenance of places of unlawful detention and torture chambers"" and stated that his actions ""facilitated the establishment of places of unlawful detention."" (Newswire)"
https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/14/new-association-formed-for-sri-lankan-women-judges/,2025-03-14,New Association formed for Sri Lankan women judges,"New appointments have been made to the Sri Lanka Association of Women Judges (SLAWJ), during its inaugural meeting held in line with International Women's Day, commemorated on 08 March.

Twenty-six (26) sitting and retired women judges came together for the inaugural meeting of the association, which has been formed to address gender disparities in the Justice Sector of Sri Lanka.

While Supreme Court Judges Justice Kumudini Wickremasinghe and Justice Menaka Jayasudara were appointed as President and Vice President of the Association respectively, former Supreme Court Judge, Justice Shiranee Tilakawardane was appointed as the Patron of SLAWJ.

Delivering her opening remarks, Justice Kumudini Wickremasinghe, Supreme Court Judge stated, ""This gathering marks not only the beginning of an organisation but a collective commitment to advancing gender equality, strengthening judicial integrity, and fostering an inclusive legal system that empowers women within the judiciary.""

Elucidating on their role, she further stated, ""As women judges, we have a significant role in providing comfort to vulnerable witnesses, focusing on support rather than favouritism in court and ensuring that patriarchal attitudes do not lead to victim blaming in court proceedings.""

Justice Wickremasinghe emphasised that the SLAWJ will strive to encourage more women to pursue careers in the judiciary by challenging societal stigmas and demonstrating that a woman can successfully balance both her professional and personal responsibilities.

The formation of the association marks a significant step in addressing gender disparities in the Justice Sector of Sri Lanka. This inaugural meeting was supported under UNDP's ongoing project titled 'Ensuring Justice for Victim-survivors of SGBV in Sri Lanka' implemented with the generous support of the Government of Canada and in collaboration with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Government of Sri Lanka. The association complements efforts supported by the project to increase the capacity of justice sector actors to respond effectively to the issues of SGBV victims.

Underscoring the importance of this association, Azusa Kubota, Resident Representative of UNDP Sri Lanka stated ""Upon learning about the objectives of the Association, I was deeply inspired. This partnership amplifies our collective efforts towards improving access to justice amongst the most vulnerable. Their mission to drive systemic reforms within the judiciary--tackling biases and obstacles that hinder the professional growth of women judges--is both timely and essential. Moreover, their commitment to advocating for legislative changes that promote gender-responsive laws and policies will have a lasting impact on women's access to justice, that is fair and timely.""

Chief Guest of the event, former Supreme Court Judge, Justice Shiranee Tilakawardane stated ""Having a network of women judges to support, encourage and mentor each other, to share in the achievements and challenges of being women judges in their judicial systems has proven to play a real role for women judges throughout the years from the kernel of the idea to the present day. Being affiliated to the IAWJ has been transformational, providing opportunities to learn, understand and grasp the importance of substantive equality in law and in life.""

The Sri Lanka Association of Women Judges seeks to become an affiliate of the International Association of Women Judges, a global network of women judges to advance gender equality and human rights.

Commenting on the importance of women representation in the judiciary, Judge Robyn Tupman, Secretary and Treasurer of the International Association of Women Judges stated that ""It seems to me is that the judiciary in any one country, if it's doing its job properly, must always be reflective of the population it serves. To repeat that old adage, 'you can't be what you can't see', and so it's important that we as women judges continue to promote a positive role model for young girls and women thinking of and in the legal profession, that they can rise to the higher levels of judicial appointment and to the higher levels of the judiciary. therefore, we should encourage women to become members of the judiciary and to remain in those positions and to achieve the highest possible level that they can reach.""

India securing the title with a four-wicket win over New Zealand, playing all of their games in Dubai despite the tournament being hosted by Pakistan.

The BCCI's reasoning behind the move was that the Indian government had refused their cricket team permission to travel to Pakistan, with tensions between the neighbouring countries running high.

""Something's got to give... India can't get everything,"" Roberts said on Mid-Day.

""At the Champions Trophy, India did not have to travel at all. How can a team not travel during a tournament? It is not fair, it's not cricket.

""There has to be a level playing field. I know a lot of money comes from India, but cricket ought not to be a one-country sport.

Roberts went on to say that the ""ICC stands for Indian Cricket Board"".

""India dictates everything. If tomorrow, India says, 'listen there should be no no-balls and wides,' take my word, the ICC will find a way to satisfy India,"" he said.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/15/violent-crimes-against-women-special-statement-from-20-npp-women-mps/,2025-03-15,Violent crimes against women : Special statement from 20 NPP Women MPs,"The Sexual Assault of a doctor in Anuradhapura hospital has once again sparked a discussion on our collective failure to combat violent crimes against women. While we express our solidarity and empathy with the survivor of this particular incident we also stress that regardless of the social category or the identity of the victim, our mission should be to dismantle the culture of violence against women.

Every day we hear of one crime or the other against women, ranging from murder to sexual assault to sexual harassment at a workplace or in cyber space. Hate Speech against women is normalized indicating a deeper problem of a culture of misogyny which builds towards a culture of physical and sexual violence. It is important to understand that often normalized acts of online abuse and verbal harassment are part and parcel of a culture that considers women to be sub- human.

If we take this particular incident we notice the same casual misogyny taking over what was initially an empathetic response from all quarters of the society.

Therefore as women, who have continuously advocated for reforms to support survivors of violence and harassment, we consider it our duty to contribute to the public debate as we strive in our capacities to reform the systems tacking violence and harassment against women.

We are especially deeply concerned about the publication of the victim's statement in the media and the lack of sensitivity in our system towards violent crimes against women which leads to such lapses. The law enforcement authorities and the media must act with sensitivity towards survivors of violence and harassment. In a large number of cases women are discouraged to report incidents of violence and harassment to authorities precisely because of the stigma attached to their names from there on. Every survivor has a right to privacy. The judiciary, police and the media must prioritize the privacy and well-being of survivors if we are to encourage reporting of crimes to authorities.

Often such violations of privacy lead to victim blaming on a large scale, as we see in this case too. Social media chatter about the supposed credibility of the actions of the woman following the crime creates a culture of shame and self-doubt which prevents women from reporting sexual assault to authorities.

Therefore we request everyone to protect the privacy of the woman involved and refrain from gossiping and sharing misguided theories about such violent crimes. Survivors do not have one size fit all reactions. In order to combat this silent epidemic of violence against women we must center our justice system on the experience of women who face such situations.

Therefore we urge that necessary reforms to our criminal justice system and media should be made to enhance our institutional capacity to combat violence against women. Clear and definite standards should be put in place for the police, the judges and the media to handle cases of crimes against women. As a society we need to approach these crimes with empathy protecting the privacy of the survivors without adding to her burden and discouraging women from coming forward to report and seek justice.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/15/trump-plans-travel-ban-on-citizens-from-43-countries/,2025-03-15,Trump plans travel ban on citizens from 43 countries,"The Donald Trump administration is considering targeting the citizens of as many as 43 countries as part of a new ban on travel to the United States that would be broader than the restrictions imposed during President Trump's first term, according to officials familiar with the matter.

A draft list of recommendations developed by diplomatic and security officials suggests a ""red"" list of 11 countries whose citizens would be flatly barred from entering the United States.

They are Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen, the officials said.

Draft List of Proposed Travel Ban Countries

The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive internal deliberations, cautioned that the list had been developed by the State Department several weeks ago, and that changes were likely by the time it reached the White House.

Officials at embassies and in regional bureaus at the State Department, and security specialists at other departments and intelligence agencies, have been reviewing the draft. They are providing comment about whether descriptions of deficiencies in particular countries are accurate or whether there are policy reasons -- like not risking disruption to cooperation on some other priority -- to reconsider including some.

The draft proposal also included an ""orange"" list of 10 countries for which travel would be restricted but not cut off. In those cases, affluent business travelers might be allowed to enter, but not people traveling on immigrant or tourist visas.

Citizens on that list would also be subjected to mandatory in-person interviews in order to receive a visa. It included Belarus, Eritrea, Haiti, Laos, Myanmar, Pakistan, Russia, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Turkmenistan.

When he took office on Jan. 20, Mr. Trump issued an executive order requiring the State Department to identify countries ""for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries.""

He gave the department 60 days to finish a report for the White House with that list, meaning it is due next week. The State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs has taken the lead, and the order said the Justice and Homeland Security Departments and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence were to assist with the effort.

Spokespeople at several agencies declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment. But the State Department previously said it was following Mr. Trump's order and was ""committed to protecting our nation and its citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process,"" while declining to specifically discuss internal deliberations.

It is also not clear whether people with existing visas would be exempted from the ban, or if their visas would be canceled. Nor is it clear whether the administration intends to exempt existing green card holders, who are already approved for lawful permanent residency.

Some of the countries on the draft red and orange lists were sanctioned by Mr. Trump in his first-term travel bans, but many are new. Some share characteristics with the earlier lists -- they are generally Muslim-majority or otherwise nonwhite, poor and have governments that are considered weak or corrupt.

But the reason several others were included was not immediately clear. Bhutan, for example, was proposed for an absolute ban on entry. The small Buddhist and Hindu country is sandwiched between China and India, neither of which were on any of the draft lists.

The proposal to sharply restrict, if not outright ban, visitors from Russia raises a different issue. While the Russian government has a reputation for corruption, Mr. Trump has been trying to reorient U.S. foreign policy in a more Russia-friendly direction.

A decision to include Venezuela could also disrupt a nascent thaw in relations that has been useful to Mr. Trump's separate efforts to deport undocumented migrants.

The proposal also includes a draft ""yellow"" list of 22 countries that would be given 60 days to clear up perceived deficiencies, with the threat of being moved onto one of the other lists if they did not comply.

Such issues could include failing to share with the United States information about incoming travelers, purportedly inadequate security practices for issuing passports, or the selling of citizenship to people from banned countries, which could serve as a loophole around the restrictions.

That list, the officials said, included Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Chad, the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Dominica, Equatorial Guinea, Gambia, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, São Tomé and Príncipe, Vanuatu and Zimbabwe.

Mr. Trump's executive order in January said he would revive the bans in order to protect American citizens ""from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes."" (NYT)"

Prices hit a record $3,005 before paring those gains a bit to just under $3,000.

Jason Hollands, managing director at Evelyn Partners, a UK wealth manager, described the yellow metal as ""the panic asset of choice"" and said the latest rise in prices reflected ""the extreme uncertainty facing the global trade system at the moment from the Trump administration's erratic and aggressive approach to tariffs and corresponding retaliatory measures.""

Footage of the evacuation showed passengers huddled on the wing of the Boeing airliner, some holding bags, with flames burning near the bottom of the plane.
