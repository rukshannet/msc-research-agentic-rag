That will mean all goods from the country are subject to a tariff of at least 104%.

China was already set to see tariffs increase by 34% on Wednesday as part of Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs package. But the president tacked on another 50% after Beijing didn't back off its promise to impose 34% retaliatory tariffs on US goods by noon Tuesday.

""Countries like China, who have chosen to retaliate and try to double down on their mistreatment of American workers, are making a mistake,"" Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday. ""President Trump has a spine of steel, and he will not break.""

""The Chinese want to make a deal, they just don't know how to do it,"" she added. She declined to share what, if any, terms Trump would consider to lower tariffs on China.

China was America's second largest source of imports last year, shipping a total of $439 billion worth of goods to the US, while the US exported $144 billion worth of goods to China. The mutual tariffs threaten to hurt domestic industries and are poised to result in layoffs.

Dozens of other countries as well as the European Union also face a midnight deadline for new tariff rates. Those rates, which Trump laid out last week, range from 11% to 50%.

Leavitt told reporters that despite several conversations with world leaders aiming to negotiate lower tariff rates, Trump has little appetite to delay his plans.

Having spoken with Trump earlier on Tuesday, Leavitt said, ""He expects that these tariffs are going to go into effect."" (CNN)"

The discussions mainly focused on proposals to transform SriLankan Airlines into a more profitable state-owned enterprise. Special attention was also given to possible short-term and long-term solutions for the airline's debt management.

The talks further explored new investment opportunities for the airline. The President instructed the officials to take all necessary steps to transform SriLankan Airlines into a profit-making entity.

Although the airline has recorded operational profits, due to past mismanagement and poor decision-making, it remains one of the leading loss-making state enterprises. The current government has decided to reverse the previous administration's decision to privatize the airline. Instead, it plans to continue operating it as the national carrier while introducing a new management structure to ensure its profitability moving forward.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/08/us-tariff-sri-lanka-ranils-warning/,2025-04-08,US Tariff & Sri Lanka : Ranil's warning,"Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe has warned of severe economic repercussions for Sri Lanka stemming from the ongoing trade war between the United States and China.

Issuing a statement, Wickremesinghe highlighted the U.S.'s recent imposition of ""reciprocal"" tariffs and China's retaliatory measures, warning that the resulting trade tensions could severely impact Sri Lanka's export-driven economy through factory closures, large-scale job losses, and widening trade deficits.

He urged immediate policy action, including implementing the National Tariff Policy, engaging with the EU on GSP+ benefits, and fast-tracking trade agreements such as the ECTA with India.

Full statement:

The U.S' so-called ""reciprocal"" tariff and China's retaliatory tariff on the U.S. have started a trade war. It brings to an end a globalisation and the WTO rules supporting it.

It will now lead to an uncertain period of the major economic powers, either challenging each other and/or cooperating with them. In this breakdown of the present world order, the worst affected will be small countries like Sri Lanka with economies on the export of one or two commodities, with the US being a major
market.

Even after negotiations the tariffs will not return to pre-April 2nd levels. This will bring about a disruption in Sri Lanka's exports, resulting in factory closures and large scale lay-offs, which may according to industry even be about 100,000. Similarly, the widening trade deficits will bring about a current account deficit.
With the overall external trade being affected, the government will not be able to achieve the revenue estimated from duties and excise.

There is a strong possibility of political upheavals taking place due to the deteriorating economic situation, not only Sri Lanka but also in the neighbouring countries. Consideration may be given to the following measures in determining
remedial action.

1) In June 2024 the Cabinet of Ministers approved the National Tariff Policy
which was to be introduced in January 2025. With a simplified four band tariff regime (of 0%, 10%, 20% 30%) to be implemented from the 1st of January 2025. Many of the para-tariffs were to be removed, and the tariff regime was to be based on the principles of transparency, consistency and predictability. The Cabinet also approved the Trade National Single Window
to be fast-tracked for implementation in 2025, addressing the non-trade barrier. So far these have not been implemented.

2) Under the proposed GSP Plus with EU, Sri Lanka together with seven countries form a duty free zone. In order to qualify for GSP Plus, we have to become parties to the following 27 conventions.

1. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights2. International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights
3. International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination
4. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women
5. Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
6. Convention on the Rights of the Child
7. Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
8. Minimum Age for Admission to Employment (N° 138)
9. Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child
Labour (N° 182)
10. Abolition of Forced Labour Convention (N° 105)
11. Forced Compulsory Labour Convention (N° 29)
12. Equal Remuneration of Men and Women Workers for Work of Equal Value
Convention (N° 100)
13. Discrimination in Respect of Employment and Occupation Convention (N° 111)
14. Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention (N° 87)
15. Application of the Principles of the Right to Organise and to Bargain Collectively.
Convention (N° 98)
16. International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of
Apartheid
17. Montreal Protocol on Substances that deplete the Ozone Layer
18. Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes
and Their Disposal
19. Stockholm Convention on persistent Organic Pollutants
20. Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
21. Convention on Biological Diversity22. Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety
23. Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change24. UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961)
25. UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971)26. UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances
(1988)
27. Mexico UN Convention Against Corruption
We are parties to many of these Conventions, if not all. Therefore, the Government must take immediate steps to negotiate with EU when they
visit Sri Lanka in May.

3) The Government must also take all steps to conclude the ECTA negotiations
with India, within 3 months so as to access the Indian markets.

4) Implement the Thailand-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement immediately."

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/08/promoting-regional-peace-one-mountain-at-a-time/,2025-04-08,"One Lankan, Many Mountains: An Adventure for Regional Peace","By Regina Johnson/Sapan News

One man's journey to climbing mountains symbolizes his struggles and the slow and painful, but inspiring process of rebuilding his life as he finds a way to live with loss and honour his late father in a meaningful way.

As a self described 'adventurer' rather than the IT expert he is by profession, Dimantha Dilan Thenuwara's decision to climb Mount Ama Dablam in the Himalayas is an example of how you can rebuild yourself mentally and physically after a tragedy.

Next week, Thenuwara from Sri Lanka starts his adventure in Nepal. He is driven not only by the need to challenge himself and inspire others, but also to uphold the idea of regional peace.

""I come from nothing,"" he told Sapan News over a Zoom call last week. ""If I can do this, anyone can.""

Thenuwara is among the hundreds of individuals who have endorsed the Founding Charter of the Southasia Peace Action Network, known as Sapan, a regional and diasporic peace initiative. His humanitarian interests align with Sapan's values, promoting peace, cooperation, and empathy in Southasia and beyond.

If he succeeds in the climb,Thenuwara will become the first Sri Lankan IT professional to summit Ama Dablam. There, he plans to hoist the Sri Lankan and Nepali flags, as well as a flag bearing the Sapan logo, and his company logo. In the process, he is also planting seeds of regional peace and understanding.

""Nepal is not just about mountains,"" Thenuwara told Sapan News. ""It is also about people.""

In that spirit, he said he would wear traditional Nepal clothing to underscore the importance of the people-to-people connections. He also gratefully acknowledges the invaluable help he has already received from the Sherpa community, particularly Ngaa Tenji Sherpa, Miles (Dawa) Sherpa and Summit Force.

He doesn't consider mountain climbing his profession or climbs simply for personal interest. Rather, ""it serves as the core of my existence and the purpose I live for,"" he said in a statement.

That purpose is to combine his love of mountain climbing adventures with his interest in humanitarian projects and cross-cultural dialogue.

He put this sentiment into action in 2023, when he helped coordinate a visit to Sri Lanka by Pakistani art students learning about his homeland's culture and heritage.

What pushed him to these new heights? Twenty years ago, Thenuwara's father died in the deadly tsunami that hit South and Southeast Asia, killing about 230,000 people across several countries in the region. Sri Lanka had over 40,000 casualties.

Without the rock that was his father, Thenuwara had to learn to reach within himself for strength and overcome hurdles through sheer perseverance.

As if surviving a tsunami, working to regain his physical strength, and putting himself through university wasn't hard enough, he made plans to climb Ama Dablam or the ""Matterhorn of the Himalayas,"" a 22,349 ft (6,812 m) mountain in Nepal.

He's no amateur, he's climbed before. But never in the kind of conditions he is headed for now.

In March 2022, Thenuwara embarked on a two-day trek along the 'lost trail' through Sri Lanka's Sinharaja tropical rainforest to climb Adam's Peak, which stands at 7,359 ft (2,243 m). He succeeded, but he also injured his knee, and it took him nearly a year to recover. While he was still undergoing physiotherapy, a friend showed him a picture of K2 in Pakistan and asked if he could climb it.

Challenge accepted. If he is successful, Thenuwara will become the first Sri Lankan to climb K2. Besides physical training, he has started learning Urdu in preparation, which stood him in good stead for his trip there in 2023 to mark 75 years of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and Sri Lanka, which he wrote about for Sapan News.

Located in the Karakoram mountain range in Pakistan, K2, also known as the Savage Mountain, is the second-highest mountain in the world at over 28,251 ft (8,611 m).

""It's a savage mountain that tries to kill you,"" said American climber George Bell,  after a 1953 expedition.

When Thenuwara began making his plans, putting his own savings into the Ama Dablam project, he wasn't sure if his employer, the Dr. Sulaiman Al Habib Medical Group, would give him leave to undertake the expedition. They not only happily did so but also made a financial contribution which he gratefully accepted though he hadn't asked for it.

The division he works for, Cloud Solutions, has his back on social media with the hashtag #ClouderOnThePeak.

Thenuwara has been doing martial arts and meditation for years to strengthen his body and mind. For his climb to Ama Dablam, he began training earlier this year. He starts at around 4 a.m. to walk 15 km or so, wearing a 10 kg weight jacket, then hits the gym for an hour's weight-training session before heading to the office.

In Nepal he will need to acclimatise himself to colder temperatures and high altitudes before attempting the Ama Dablam adventure.

Addressing the matter during the weekly Cabinet media briefing, Jayatissa presented monthly figures verified by the Central Bank, outlining Sri Lanka's official reserve levels from September 2024 to March 2025.

According to the data revealed by the Minisiter:

•⁠ ⁠September 2024: $5.99 billion
•⁠ ⁠October 2024: $6.47 billion
•⁠ ⁠November 2024: $6.45 billion
•⁠ ⁠December 2024: $6.12 billion
•⁠ ⁠January 2025: $6.06 billion
•⁠ ⁠February 2025: $6.08 billion
•⁠ ⁠March 2025: $6.51 billion

""If there has been any error, I request that these official figures released by the Central Bank be accepted,"" Jayatissa said.

The statement comes after Deputy Minister Hewage claimed that the Treasury held only $20 million when the National People's Power (NPP) government took office.

He made the remark during a public rally in Galle ahead of the Local Government Elections, adding that the new government had since increased reserves to $6.19 billion.

Hewage's comment sparked criticism and prompted calls for clarification from government officials. (Newswire)"

Appearing for the petitioner bank were attorneys Geeth Karunarathna, Manujaya De Silva, and Nisal Dulmith. The court has fixed the matter for notice returnable on April 21.

The order comes in the wake of a reported data breach said to contain sensitive customer information including national identity details. Several journalists and digital rights activists have raised concerns over the breach and the response to it.

In a statement issued in March, Cargills Bank said that upon detection, it acted promptly to reinforce its security protocols, isolate the affected system, and engage leading cybersecurity experts for a comprehensive assessment. The bank said this proactive approach aimed to mitigate potential risks, ensure system integrity, and safeguard both customer and institutional interests.

At the same time, he announced he was raising tariff rates on China to 125%, ratcheting up his tit-for-tat with Beijing. US stocks were volatile and skyrocketed higher after Trump announced the pause.

Trump's full statement on Truth Social:

""Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately.

At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.

Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"""

Stating that the agreements signed during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit have been openly announced to the public, he said they are beneficial to both nations.

""Both Sri Lanka and India benefit from these agreements. The NPP Government has proven to be the government to have received the most international support in Sri Lanka's history.

Tilvin Silva pointed out that the former Ranil Wickremesinghe-led government, together with the Rajapaksa clan, attempted to sell the local milk producer, MILCO, to an Indian company, but the move was stopped due to the NPP Government having approached India on the matter.

Acknowledging that the NPP/JVP had lobbied against several projects in the past, Tilvin Silva said they protested the Indo-Lanka Agreement in 1987, which saw the Indian Army entering Sri Lanka, as it was deemed a betrayal of the nation.

""Yes, we did protest against India in the past. However, India has changed now, and so has the world. Just because we protested in 1987, should we still hold on to that anger?

""We continue clearing debris and searching for people,"" he said. ""We're going to search tirelessly for people.""

Rescue workers were prioritising three areas in the club, he said, adding: ""We're hearing some sounds.""

Nelsy Cruz, the governor of the northern Montecristi province, is among those to have died.

Octavio Dotel, a former MLB pitcher who won a world championship with the St Louis Cardinals and played for 13 teams in a 15-year career, was also among the victims.

Dotel, 51, died en route to a local hospital after being pulled from the debris, a spokesman for the nation's sports ministry said

Meanwhile, the injured include Dominican singer Rubby Perez, who was performing when the roof collapsed.

His manager Enrique Paulino, whose shirt was spattered with blood, told reporters at the scene that the concert began shortly before midnight, with the roof collapsing almost an hour later, killing the group's saxophonist.

Mr Paulino said: ""It happened so quickly. I managed to throw myself into a corner.""

He added that he initially thought there had been an earthquake.

Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader wrote on X: ""We deeply regret the tragedy that occurred at the Jet Set nightclub. We have been following the incident minute by minute since it occurred.

Mr Abinader arrived at the scene and hugged those looking for friends and family, some with tears streaming down their faces.

He did not speak to reporters.

""You have to cooperate with authorities... please,"" he said.

""We are removing people.""

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/09/why-trumps-reciprocal-tariffs-are-not-actually-reciprocal/,2025-04-09,Why Trump's 'reciprocal tariffs' are not actually reciprocal,"The US President claims his tariffs are ""reciprocal"" yet the evidence suggests they are disproportionately harsh on many countries. It points to a different motivation -- to remove US trade deficits.

When US President Donald Trump announced the details of his wave of tariffs to a packed Rose Garden at the White House on April 2, he broke into a riff on the meaning of the word ""reciprocal.""

""Reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world,"" he said. ""Reciprocal. That means: they do it to us and we do it to them. Very simple. Can't get any simpler than that.""

Trump announced two main sets of tariffs that day -- a 10% levy on practically all US imports from all countries, and then an additional set of ""reciprocal tariffs"" on various countries, ranging in level according to a much-derided government formula almost exclusively focused on trade deficits.

The US President and his economic team have repeatedly insisted that the reciprocal tariffs are simply returning the same barriers that US exporters face when selling to the same countries.

Flawed formula

However, a range of economists, banks and financial institutions have pointed out that the tariffs are not reciprocal and that the formula Trump's team used to calculate them makes little economic sense.

""The formula he used is nonsense,"" Bill Reinsch, a senior economics adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told DW.

""Everybody knows it's nonsense and bears no relationship to what they said they were going to do, which was to be reciprocal and factor in actual trade barriers, including tariffs, but also nontariff barriers. There's no evidence that they made the slightest effort to do that.""

Doug Irwin, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a renowned global trade expert, also says the tariffs are clearly not reciprocal for a number of reasons.

He told DW that a key point was that the formula used by the White House did not even take into account the levels of tariffs imposed by other countries, and simply took America's trade deficit in goods with each country and then divided it by the amount of goods imported into the US from that country.

Reciprocal tariffs, he noted, have been applied to countries with which the US have existing free trade agreements, such as Chile, Australia, and Peru and South Korea.

""Those are already reciprocal in the sense that we don't charge them and they don't charge us,"" he said. ""What's really going on is it's not foreign trade barriers, it's the trade deficit that they've focused on. That's the metric that they're using to impute trade barriers.""

Anything but reciprocal

Data from the World Trade Organization (WTO) backs up the arguments made by several economists that Trump's allegedly reciprocal tariffs will actually be far higher than most of those levied in the opposite direction.

Perhaps the most prominent example is China. Beijing was the focus of Trump's tariffs in his first term as president from 2017-2021 and with some justification. China had consistently charged higher tariffs on US goods than vice versa.

However, the latest sweeping tariffs from Washington mean that US tariffs on Chinese goods are now significantly higher than the other way around.

According to some estimates, US tariffs on Chinese goods are now at around 75%, compared to a 56% rate in the other direction. Meanwhile,Trump has threatened to increase existing tariffs by another 50%, after China responded to his latest levies with a 34% hike.

Another clear example is Vietnam. Washington will now charge Vietnam a 46% tariff, but the WTO's Tariff & Trade Data portal shows that Vietnam charges the US a simple average tariff of 9.4% and a weighted average tariff, which takes into account the share of products at different tariff rates, of 5.1%.

However the Vietnam example shows it is clearly not about reciprocity.

Hanoi immediately offered to drop all tariffs on US imports but Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro responded in an interview on CNBC that the offer would not be enough ""because it's the nontariff cheating that matters."" He cited Chinese goods being sold through Vietnam and VAT as examples of ""cheating.""

Bill Reinsch says the fact that the White House did not measure tariff barriers, let alone nontariff barriers of the kind alleged by Navarro in its formula, suggests it is ""not really interested in the idea of reciprocity.""

""It's just a game. And so there will be negotiations,"" said Reinsch.

Such negotiations with the likes of Vietnam will undoubtedly focus on the countries' trade balances, but Doug Irwin thinks it's ""implausible"" that the US could have balanced trade or a trade surplus with Vietnam, given the nature of their respective economies.

""Vietnam has received a lot of foreign investments, so we export components to them, but they export final assemble goods to us,"" he said, adding that this ""naturally implies there's going to be a trade deficit.""

What Trump really wants

Bill Reinsch argues that for more than 40 years, Trump has spoken about how he believes the US is being ""ripped off"" on global trade. He believes Trump genuinely wants to restructure global trade, which, however, has turned into a ""revenge thing.""

""The problem with it is he really only has one metric, which is the bilateral trade deficit, and he really only has one tool, which is tariffs,"" said Reinsch.

For the CSIS economist the Trump administration fundamentally believes trade deficits are unfair, and that they will only be satisfied when those deficits are eliminated -- however unrealistic and economically improbable that goal is.

""If you listen to Navarro, and actually sometimes Trump, that's the undertone here, that if we have a deficit with country A, that can only be because they're doing something unfair, and trade should be balanced,"" Reinsch said, adding that such a reasoning ""doesn't make any sense.""

Irwin agrees, saying that trade deficits are Trump's ultimate concern. ""Not so much the revenue, it's not so much equality or fairness or reciprocity. He doesn't like trade deficits. And he's been very consistent on that for 40 years."" (DW)"

The rally followed an initial surge in the previous session that saw the precious metal gain over 3%, as US tariffs on 60 of its trade partners came into effect.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/10/sri-lankas-new-proceeds-of-crime-act-5-key-updates/,2025-04-10,Sri Lanka's new proceeds of crime act: 5 key updates,"Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) welcomes the passage of the Proceeds of Crime Act, which was approved by Parliament on 8 April 2025. This is a landmark development in Sri Lanka's anti-corruption and asset recovery framework, filling a long-standing legal gap and introducing powerful tools to combat illicit enrichment and the flow of black money.

TISL commends the work of the drafting committee for navigating the complexity of this legislation, which is designed to ensure that stolen assets are recovered and redirected for public benefit.

The new law introduces mechanisms for identifying, freezing, seizing, and confiscating the proceeds of crime, including in cases where a criminal conviction may not be possible. Notably, it provides for non-conviction-based forfeiture, a shift in the burden of proof in specific proceedings, and robust channels for international cooperation in tracing assets hidden across borders.

These legal tools are crucial in addressing grand corruption, where assets are often laundered through sophisticated local and global networks. Without such mechanisms, Sri Lanka has historically struggled to recover stolen public funds.

Importantly, the law focuses on the recovery of illicit assets rather than the prosecution of offenders. This is a critical strategy to disrupt the financial rewards of corruption and weaken the foundations of kleptocracy.

TISL also draws attention to several concerns that must be addressed to ensure the Act's successful implementation. Stronger safeguards and judicial oversight are necessary within investigation processes to prevent the misuse of powers and uphold due process. The Proceeds of Crime Management Authority (PCMA) must function with the highest standards of transparency, and board members should be adequately and fairly compensated to attract qualified professionals and reduce corruption risks. Likewise, the Victims of Crime Reparations Trust Fund must be governed with clear selection criteria, term limits, disqualification processes, and strong conflict-of-interest safeguards to maintain public trust.

In addition to implementation issues, TISL remains concerned about broader challenges in Sri Lanka's legislative process. The development of this law highlighted continued translation errors from English to Sinhala, which risk undermining its intent and application--particularly since the Sinhala version has legal precedence. These issues reinforce the need for institutionalised mechanisms for public and expert participation from the earliest stages of lawmaking, to ensure clarity, coherence, and alignment with the public interest and international standards.

Looking ahead, TISL urges the government and implementing institutions to ensure that the Proceeds of Crime Act is applied with integrity, fairness, and transparency. This includes the responsible and open management of recovered assets, robust public oversight, and ensuring that these powerful tools are used proportionately and in line with the law's intended focus on grand corruption and serious crime. The ultimate goal must remain clear: to ensure that corruption and crime do not pay--and that stolen wealth is returned to its rightful owners, whether individuals or the public at large.

TISL remains committed to supporting the effective implementation of this law, for which it has long advocated, and will continue to push for transparency, accountability, and public participation across every stage of Sri Lanka's reform journey.


* The Proceeds of Crime Act introduces non-conviction based asset forfeiture and strengthens Sri Lanka's legal tools for recovering illicit assets, including those held abroad.
* The law shifts the burden of proof, enabling more effective recovery of stolen wealth and aligning Sri Lanka's legal framework with international standards.
* TISL highlights the law's focus on asset recovery rather than punishment, reinforcing its potential to disrupt the financial incentives of grand corruption and kleptocracy.
* There is a strong need for judicial safeguards within investigation processes to uphold due process.
* The drafting process once again revealed its weaknesses and lack of structured public consultation, which must be addressed through reform of Sri Lanka's lawmaking process."

According to the analysis, the 7% increase in 2025 was mainly driven by a sharp rise in coconut and coconut oil prices, which surged by 80% and 40% respectively. Prices of most other ingredients either remained stable or declined.

In 2024, the cost of kevili ingredients was already 2.2 times higher than in 2019. By 2025, it has risen to 2.4 times the 2019 level.

A kevili table typically includes traditional Sri Lankan sweet treats such as milk rice, kokis, banana, aluwa, kevum, dodol, mun kevum, and butter cake--symbolising prosperity and happiness during the New Year.

The analysis was based on quantities used in recipes from the popular YouTube channel ""Appe Amma,"" designed for a household of 4-5 people. Only the main ingredients were considered, excluding utility and spice costs. Price data was sourced from the Department of Census and Statistics, including Open Market Weekly Average Retail prices in the Colombo District for April 2019 (Week 1), April 2023 (Week 1), March 2024 (Week 3), and March 2025 (Week 3)."

Accordingly, she stressed the need to implement an active mechanism to monitor and attend to children from birth, starting from the period under the supervision of the Public Health Midwife and throughout the early childhood development stages.

Minister Paulraj also revealed that plans are in place to establish three model daycare centers in identified regions for children with autism. It was also proposed to appoint a committee to carry out the necessary arrangements for this initiative, with the intention of guiding such children through appropriate stages of development.

BOI Chairman, Arjuna Hearth, invited all top 50 exporters of the BOI in key industries to open a dialogue to seek alternative strategies to mitigate the consequences due to the new US tariff.

Also participating in the meeting, Senior Advisor to the President, Duminda Hulangamuwa, explained what government initiatives have been taken so far to achieve positive outcomes and stage the negotiations.

""The diplomatic-level discussion has already taken place, and our diplomatic officers in Washington, DC, have already established communication with the respective trade delegates at the White House's trade department. Almost 70 countries have already reached out to the US to seek individual consultations from the US government on specific tariffs to reach a further consensus.

""There is a diverse range of Sri Lankan businesses that export to the United States, and around 200 of these are BOI enterprises. In 2024, the U.S. goods trade deficit with Sri Lanka was approximately $2.6 billion, with U.S. goods imports from Sri Lanka totaling $3.0 billion and exports to Sri Lanka at $368.2 million,"" he said.

He further said that the representatives from the apparel industry, rubber industry, food industry, and ornament industry also participated in the discussion.

During the discussion, it was highlighted that most countries are seeking alternative trade agreements and new market opportunities to mitigate the US's impact on specific economies and seek further trade relationships. These developments encourage Sri Lankan industries to explore partnerships with emerging markets and diversify their supply chains. By fostering collaborations with countries outside the traditional trading powers, they can enhance their resilience and adaptability in an ever-changing global landscape. (Newswire)"

It was expected that the number of aircraft stands at Bandaranaike International Airport would be increased through the construction of a Remote Apron and Taxiways as part of the Bandaranaike International Airport Development Project.

However, it was observed that both the AASL and the Japanese joint venture company hired for design and consultancy services had undertaken these activities without proper technical or operational analysis. As a result, achieving the project's objectives proved challenging.

Despite several weaknesses and practical challenges identified at the planning stage, the Committee noted that steps were taken to complete the project. Accordingly, the solutions already proposed by AASL to achieve the desired objectives of the project were also observed.

The COPE members held extensive discussions with local representatives from the Japanese joint venture and senior officials from relevant institutions. During these discussions, the Committee expressed displeasure over the financial losses incurred by the government due to these oversight issues and poor planning. The Committee recommended that, to prevent further misuse of public funds in future development activities, attention must be given to the issues arising during planning stages.

The Committee decided to reconvene with the officials from AASL in the near future to continue discussions on the matter. (Parliament)

The Badulla District MP was recently arrested over the alleged misappropriation of funds from the Provincial Council fixed deposit with a state bank.

Making a special statement, the former President made the following remarks concerning the matter;

I met with members of MP Chamara Sampath Dassanayake's family. During my time as Prime Minister, a circular was issued by the Treasury Secretary with the approval of then President Maithripala Sirisena, stating that Provincial Council funds could not be placed in fixed deposit accounts. The circular noted that both government funds and other allocated funds must be spent within the same year or returned to the Ministry of Finance or the relevant Provincial Council ministry. Since holding back and depositing those funds for use in future projects was illegal, we took steps to stop that practice.

At that time, Chief Minister Chamara Sampath and several other Chief Ministers raised concerns and were informed why such deposits were not permitted. Accordingly, they withdrew those funds from the fixed deposit accounts.

This wasn't limited to Uva Province - similar actions were taken in other provinces as well. Chamara Sampath regularly communicated with me, and I supported him on educational and other matters. However, we were on opposite political sides. While he was serving as Chief Minister, the current Minister Samantha Vidyaratna lodged a complaint. I told those involved that this was not a matter I would intervene in and that it should be discussed with the Bribery Commission. I also said I couldn't get involved in political or anti-political activities involving Chief Ministers.

The matter has been investigated by the Commission. Not once has Chamara Sampath been found guilty or even named as a suspect. The investigations are based on previous events, not new allegations. Another concern is that as soon as he responds to these allegations, statements are issued claiming he has been taken into custody. How can such a thing be justified?

MP Chamara Sampath is a frequent speaker in Parliament and a strong voice in the Opposition. There is a serious question as to whether this legal process is connected to his active role in Parliament. I believe he should request a Parliamentary inquiry into this and determine whether this is a violation of parliamentary privileges. (Newswire)"

The winners designed a biodegradable fish storage box as an alternative to Styrofoam-based boxes widely used in fisheries. The team, calling itself 'Myco Box by White Root', instead proposes to use mycelium, a root-like structure found in fungus.

Second place was won by an Indian youth team called 'Green Alchemy' who came up with an enzyme-based plastic biodegradation innovation. Coming third was the 'Eco Pet' team from Bhutan, who proposed a gamification platform linked to a smartphone app to promote consumer education for reducing household waste.

These winners were chosen from among 23 finalist teams - comprising 67 young men and women aged 18 to 30 - in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The competition, known as PLEASE Hack, was an initiative under the Plastic Free Rivers and Seas for South Asia (PLEASE) Project, a five-year regional initiative implemented by the South Asia Cooperative Environment Programme (SACEP), funded by the World Bank and supported by UNOPS.

The finalist teams pitched their innovative solutions to a panel of experts drawn from across the region. Judges ranked the teams based on their solutions' innovative potential, business model, implementation plan, regional collaboration and scalability as well as overall environmental and social sustainability. Their final selections were unanimous.

PLEASE Hack attracted more than 250 youth from the eight eligible countries who formed into 98 teams to present innovative solutions to reduce plastic use and improve waste management in households and communities, or in micro, small, and medium enterprises.

Shortlisted teams engaged in a two-week virtual Hackathon during March, collaborating within each team to refine and develop their innovative concepts. They received mentoring support and guidance from national experts. Country level judging then selected 23 teams who were supported to travel to the Sout Asian Regional Final held in Colombo on April 6.

The regional winners will receive seed funding to enable them in refining their innovations and present them to potential investors. National-level winners from each South Asian country were also recognised and rewarded.

""Our planet will flourish only when our youth are empowered to take stewardship,"" says Norbu Wangchuk, Director General of SACEP, expressing his enthusiasm for the initiative.

""This hackathon demonstrates the commitment of our youth in South Asia, who are not only worried about the plastic crisis that we face but also offer solutions to save the planet from the crisis. This Hackathon is empowering the youth to take charge of their future.""

""South Asia is projected to see over one million young people join the labour force monthly over the next 10 years,"" says Cecile Fruman, Director, Regional Integration in the South Asia Region (SAR) for the World Bank. ""Fostering innovation and job creation through public and private sector solutions needs to be a key priority. Initiatives such as the hackathon create sustainable job opportunities for young innovators in support of the goal of the PLEASE project to promote circular economy innovation.""

Charles Callanan, Director, South Asia Multi-Country Office, UNOPS, emphasised the long-term benefits of the event, noting, ""The PLEASE Hack Hackathon is about transforming innovation into practical solutions. We are excited to see these ideas come to life and contribute to a cleaner, more sustainable South Asia.""

Plastic Free Rivers and Seas for South Asia (PLEASE) is the region's largest initiative to combat marine plastic pollution and promote sustainable plastic use. Funded by the World Bank and implemented by the South Asia Cooperative Environment Programme (SACEP) with implementation support from UNOPS, PLEASE drives innovation through public-private partnerships, competitive grants, and circular economy solutions.

The tragedy occurred at the Jet Set club in Santo Domingo on Tuesday and families of victims have gathered outside for over two days, anxious for more information.

""In the coming hours there will be a transition from a search and rescue phase to the recovery of the bodies phase,"" presidential spokesperson Homero Figueroa said in a statement. This was after having ""exhausted all reasonable possibilities of finding more survivors,"" local newspaper the Dominican Republic Post reported.

Rescue workers have not found any survivors since Tuesday afternoon.

More than 300 rescue workers, with sniffer dogs, have spent nearly two days combing through mounds of fallen bricks, steel bars and tin sheets. They were supported by firefighters from Puerto Rico and Israel.

Officials struggle to identify victims

Relatives of people still missing held up pictures of their loved ones, describing the clothes they were wearing when the disaster struck.

They hoped it would help others identify their loved ones in case of disfigurement. The National Institute of Forensic Pathology officials read the names of 54 victims they had identified so far.

Among the worst disasters in Dominican history

Local media has initially said that 500 to 1,000 people were in the club when the disaster happened. At least 200 were injured, according to official estimates.

The Jet Set club on Tuesday said it was working with authorities probing the disaster -- one of the worst in Dominican history.

Authorities believe it is too early to assess the reason for the roof's collapse. They are likely to begin the investigation phase after recovery is concluded.

Leader of the House, Minister Bimal Rathnayake, yesterday revealed that the meeting had been organized based on a request made by 12 opposition party leaders to meet the President for a discussion on the matter.

The Donald Trump-led US Government recently imposed 44% reciprocal tariffs on Sri Lankan goods under Trump's revised trade policy, effective from 09 April 2025.

The move, described by the U.S. as a reciprocal measure in response to what it claims are Sri Lanka's 88% trade barriers on American goods, placed Sri Lanka among the countries facing the highest tariff rates globally.

However, in a surprise move yesterday, US President Donald Trump said he is applying a 90-day pause on new tariffs as his trade war shakes the world economy.

According to the White House Press Secretary, Karoline Leavitt, the pause means a ""universal 10%"" tariff will be in place for all countries, other than China. (Newswire)"

With his sweeping global tariffs now in effect, steep price hikes on products ranging from clothing to electronics could largely be borne by American consumers. Now, a prominent tech analyst has warned that the price of an Apple iPhone could soar to around $3,500 if they were made in the US.

The president and his economic officials have promised that, as a result of the tariffs, numerous manufacturing jobs will eventually be ""reshored"" to US, employing millions of Americans.

But Dan Ives, global head of technology research at financial services firm Wedbush Securities, told CNN's Erin Burnett that the idea is a ""fictional tale.""

US-made iPhones could cost more than three times their current price of around $1,000, he added, because it would be necessary to replicate the highly complex production ecosystem that currently exists in Asia.

""You build that (supply chain) in the US with a fab in West Virginia and New Jersey. They'll be $3,500 iPhones,"" he said, referring to fabrication plants, or high-tech manufacturing facilities where computer chips that power electronic devices are normally made.

And even then, it would cost Apple about $30 billion and three years to move just 10% of their supply chain to the US to begin with, Ives told Burnett on Monday. CNN has reached out to Apple for comment.

The making and assembly of smartphone parts shifted to Asia decades ago, as American companies largely focused on software development and product design, which generate much higher profit margins. That move has helped make Apple one of the world's most valuable companies and cement itself as a dominant smartphone maker.

Since Trump's inauguration in late January, Apple's shares have lost around 25% of their value due to concerns about the impact of tariffs on its sprawling supply chain, which is highly dependent on China and Taiwan. About 90% of iPhones are assembled in China.

""That's why I think you see what's happened to the stock, because no company is more caught up in this tariff front and center in this category five storm than Cupertino and Apple,"" he said. ""It's an economic Armageddon, but especially for the tech industry.""

The chips that power iPhones are mainly manufactured in Taiwan, while its screen panels are supplied by South Korean companies. Some other components are made in China, and final assembly mostly takes place in the country.

In February, Apple announced it would invest $500 billion in the US over the next four years as part of its effort expand production outside China and to avoid Trump's tariffs on the country.

Tech analysts agree that iPhone prices are likely to rise, even if supply chains stay where they are. Rosenblatt Securities, a New York-based investment bank, said iPhones could be 43% more expensive, should Apple pass on the entire cost of higher tariffs to consumers, according to a research note cited by Reuters.

Neil Shah, vice president of research at Counterpoint Research, estimates that iPhone could cost about 30% more, but this could depend on where they are made.

Apple has previously been seeking to diversify its production bases from China to India and Brazil and could look to shift production of key components to countries that face lower tariff barriers to keep the cost of its phones down. India faces 26% tariffs, whereas Brazil has been hit with 10%. Although Trump's tariffs on Brazil are the lowest among key iPhone manufacturing centers, it probably doesn't produce enough capacity to fill the gap left by China, Shah said. (CNN)"

In a statement, Verité Research said the U.S. tariff hike -- linked to trade deficits -- represents a ""severe break"" from the rules-based order established under the World Trade Organization (WTO), whose 166 member countries account for 98% of global trade.

""A rules-based order, as it exists at present, even with its many weaknesses, fosters stability, and makes all countries better-off than the alternative of a free-for-all,"" the statement said.

The think tank cautioned that while many countries are now seeking bilateral negotiations with the United States to reduce the impact of the tariffs on their own economies, this approach risks exacerbating the breakdown of the global trade framework.

Instead, Verité Research urged governments -- including Sri Lanka's -- to join forces under the WTO framework to establish a ""Cooperative Common Response"" to the U.S. action.

Such a multilateral approach, the organization argued, would help protect the stability and predictability of global trade rules and prevent further erosion of the existing international order.

Verité Research's call comes amid rising concerns globally over the escalating use of unilateral trade measures and their potential to fragment the international trading system. (Newswire)"

Part of Bangladesh's premier List A competition, Gulshan won the contest by five runs after the controversial stumping of Shinepukur wicketkeeper Minhajul Abedin, who had stepped out of crease and left the ball.

During the run chase, Shinepukur needed six runs to win from 43 balls with one wicket in hand when Abedin, unbeaten on eight at the time having faced 34 deliveries, charged at Gulshan spinner Naeem Islam and left a wide delivery.

The 27-year-old spun around and grounded his bat outside the crease before seemingly dragging the willow further away from safety. Gulshan gloveman Alif Hasan, having failed to dislodge the bails on his first attempt, completed the stumping to end the match and seal victory.

Shinepukur was bowled out for 173 in 43 overs, with the five-run defeat confirming their relegation to the competition's second division.

""This is shocking,"" commentator Mazhar Uddin Omi said.

Russia is also winner from the US China rivalry unscathed by tariffs and with a weaker US handling the Ukraine peace talks already, new proposals for World Order has come out.

ASEAN especially wants the WTO to mediate in the question of tariffs. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has suggested a coalition of the willing and at the same time that China has to increase his domestic consumption, providing an alternate market the question we faced earlier was determining China's place in a U.S. made world order. Now we have to decide the place of U.S.

The talks were conducted by a committee appointed by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to formulate proposals to reduce the trade deficit between the two countries.

Minister Jayantha said a second letter outlining Sri Lanka's position had also been sent to the U.S. President through the Sri Lankan mission in Washington.

During the discussions, Sri Lanka presented proposals aimed at narrowing the trade gap, while also requesting further dialogue on the matter, Jayantha said. He added that the Ministry of Finance is in communication with U.S. authorities and that diplomatic engagement is ongoing.

The government is also exploring the possibility of sending a Sri Lankan delegation to the U.S. to advance negotiations and finalize an agreement, he said.

Sri Lanka is currently engaged in efforts aimed at reducing its trade deficit with the U.S. and addressing the 44% tariff imposed during former President Donald Trump's administration.

The tariff -- described as a combination of import duties and non-tariff barriers -- was calculated based on the trade deficit between the two countries.

Over the past few days, the Trump administration announced a 90 day pause on global tariffs, but escalated its trade war with China, announcing a 145% tariff rate on goods exported to the US. (Newswire)"

The Commission will question Wickremesinghe over remarks he made in a special statement concerning the arrest and remanding of the Badulla District MP, who is facing corruption charges over the alleged misuse of Provincial Council funds.

In his statement, Wickremesinghe said that during his tenure as Prime Minister, the Treasury Secretary issued a circular -- with the approval of then-President Maithripala Sirisena -- prohibiting the placement of Provincial Council funds in fixed deposit accounts. He noted that funds were required to be spent within the financial year or returned to the Treasury.

He added that MP Chamara Sampath, who was then the Uva Province Chief Minister, and other provincial leaders were informed of this decision, leading to the withdrawal of such deposits.

He further questioned whether the recent legal actions were politically motivated, highlighting that Dassanayake remains a vocal Opposition member in Parliament.

Wickremesinghe also raised concerns about whether parliamentary privileges were being violated and called for an inquiry into the matter. (Newswire)"

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/11/indias-defence-exports-hit-record-2-76-billion-in-fy25-a-milestone-for-self-reliance/,2025-04-11,India's defence exports hit record $2.76 billion in FY25: A milestone for self-reliance,"India's defence sector has reached a historic milestone, with exports soaring to a record-high $2.76 billion (Rs 23,622 crore) in the financial year (FY) 2024-25.

Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh recently announced this achievement, marking a significant leap forward in India's journey toward self-reliance and global defence market competitiveness.

This surge in defence exports underscores the success of the country's ambitious 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' (Self-Reliant India) initiative and its growing stature as an emerging defence exporter.

Over the past decade, India has consistently worked to enhance its defence manufacturing capabilities and reduce dependency on foreign arms imports.

The results are now evident. Compared to just Rs 1,521 crore (USD 1.79 lakh) in FY 2016-17, India's defence exports have grown nearly 15 times in eight years.

This progress is a testament to the government's policy reforms, active participation from the private sector, and the efficiency of state-run defence public sector undertakings (DPSUs).

The latest figures place India among the fastest-growing defence exporters globally, with key defence products being shipped to more than 85 countries.

This remarkable growth reflects the increasing demand for Indian-manufactured defence equipment, including missiles, naval systems, avionics, and advanced weaponry.

Several factors have contributed to India's record-breaking defence export figures.

The Indian government has undertaken several policy reforms to create an ecosystem that encourages domestic production and exports.

Simplification of export procedures, faster clearances, and streamlined approval mechanisms have made it easier for Indian firms to sell military equipment abroad.

Incentivising domestic production of critical defence components and equipment has boosted manufacturing capabilities, while the government has increased the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) limit in defence to 74% via the automatic route, attracting global investments.

Additionally, two dedicated defence corridors in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have been established to boost indigenous defence manufacturing.

The role of India's private sector in defence manufacturing has expanded significantly.

Companies like Tata Advanced Systems, Bharat Forge, L&T Defence, and Mahindra Defence have played a crucial role in strengthening India's export capabilities.

Collaboration with foreign firms has further enhanced expertise and technological advancements.

India's focus on indigenous production has led to the development of cutting-edge military technology.

India has successfully exported BrahMosmissiles to the Philippines, with other nations showing interest, while the advanced light helicopters (ALH) Dhruv, manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), are in demand in various countries.

Meanwhile, India's shipbuilding industry, led by Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders and GRSE, has exported warships and patrol vessels to nations like the Maldives, Mauritius, and Sri Lanka.

India has strengthened its defence partnerships with various countries, particularly in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.

Nations like Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have shown interest in acquiring Indian-made defence equipment.

The Indian government's Defence Line of Credit (LoC) programme has also facilitated arms exports to friendly nations.

India's emergence as a reliable defence exporter is gaining global recognition.

The country is no longer just an importer of advanced weaponry but a manufacturer with the capability to supply critical defence equipment to foreign militaries.

India's participation in international defence expos, such as DefExpo and Aero India, has further boosted its global outreach, allowing Indian defence firms to showcase their products on a global stage.

Additionally, India's involvement in co-development and co-production with major global players has opened new avenues for exports.

Collaborative efforts with nations like the United States, France, Israel, and Russia have enhanced technological capabilities and widened the scope for international sales.

India's record-breaking defence exports in FY 2024-25 mark a defining moment in the nation's defence manufacturing journey.

The impressive $2.76 billion milestone is not just a number--it reflects India's transformation into a global defence exporter.

With continued policy support, technological advancements, and strategic partnerships, India is well on track to achieve its ambitious target of $5 billion in annual defence exports by 2028.

As the nation marches ahead in its quest for self-reliance, this achievement strengthens India's position as a formidable player in the global defence industry, ensuring a future where 'Make in India' resonates beyond borders."
https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/11/in-a-first-ukraine-captures-two-chinese-nationals-fighting-for-russia/,2025-04-11,"In a first, Ukraine captures two Chinese nationals fighting for Russia","President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian troops captured two Chinese citizens fighting for Russia, the first time its nationals were taken prisoner in the three-year war.

The Chinese men were taken captive during fighting on Ukrainian territory in the Donetsk region, Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv on Tuesday. He said he'd instructed Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha to immediately reach out to his counterpart in Beijing about the incident.

Writing on X, where he posted a video of one of the alleged men, Zelenskyy said Kyiv has ""information suggesting that there are many more Chinese citizens"" fighting.

""Russia's involvement of China, along with other countries, whether directly or indirectly, in this war in Europe is a clear signal that Putin intends to do anything but end the war,"" he wrote, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""I understand that we are a strong country, but we cannot fight multiple countries at the same time, all of whom want something on our land,"" Zelenskyy said in a joint briefing in Kyiv on Tuesday with Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever.

China's Foreign Ministry objected to Zelenskyy's remarks that more Chinese citizens were at the front line alongside Russians, calling them ""groundless.""

""Ukraine should correctly view China's efforts and constructive role in seeking a political solution to the Ukrainian crisis,"" ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular news conference Wednesday.

China was verifying the situation with Ukraine, he said, adding that its government had always required its citizens to avoid areas of armed conflict and ""especially to avoid participating in the military operations of any party.""

Beijing, which has engaged in some diplomatic efforts for peace, has said it has been objective and fair on the war.

U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the reports of Chinese nationals captured in Ukraine were disturbing but did not say whether Washington has verified the claim.

Unlike North Korea, China is not known to have sent troops to support Russia's war in Ukraine. There have been reports of Chinese nationals independently volunteering to fight with Russia.

Preliminary questioning of the men suggests that they were both recruited to fight for Russia rather than via any Chinese state involvement, according to a Ukrainian assessment shared with reporters on condition of anonymity due to the matter's diplomatic sensitivity.

The first man, whose age was given as 33, was recruited by a representative of Russia's army in China, after which he traveled to Moscow to sign a contract, according to the initial assessment.

The second, 31, said that he found an online advertisement regarding a contract with the Russian army which promised a 2 million ruble ($23,200) payment. He filled in a form and was contacted by a representative of the Russian army who spoke Chinese.

Sybiha summoned the Chinese chargé d'affaires for the first time in the history of official relations between their two countries to demand an explanation.

""Chinese citizens fighting as part of Russia's invasion army in Ukraine puts into question China's declared stance for peace,"" the foreign minister said in a statement on X.

Russia and China declared a ""no-limits"" relationship just before Moscow's February 2022 invasion, and President Xi Jinping's government has since provided Putin with diplomatic and economic support. Beijing has stopped short of providing lethal military assistance that would violate the U.S. sanctions regime, and said it supports recent efforts to reach a ceasefire. Chinese components have still been found in Russian weapons, as have American made parts.

""This is yet another country that is militarily supporting Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"" said Zelenskyy. ""On Russia's side, it follows Iran and North Korean troops. but there is a difference. North Koreans fought against us in the Kursk direction. The Chinese are fighting on Ukrainian territory. And I think this is an important point that we need to discuss with our partners -- urgently, I believe.""

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/04/11/tariff-crossfire/,2025-04-11,Tariff crossfire,"BY all accounts a world is ending and we don't know what is going to replace it. For Pakistan this is particularly troubling because despite what we like to tell ourselves, this country has always been deeply dependent on this world to keep itself afloat.

Rarely has the bigger picture mattered more than it does now. To focus only on the short-term impacts would be a mistake. The bigger picture here is brutal in its simplicity, and critical in its importance. For almost half a century now, Pakistan has been kept afloat as a country via bailouts arranged by the institutions of a multilateral world order, chief among them the IMF, followed by the World Bank. The sun is now setting on this world. The day is coming when Pakistan runs into one of its traditional balance of payments crises and runs out of foreign exchange reserves, like it has on more than a dozen occasions over the past four or five decades, and there is nobody around to come to its rescue.

As of this writing, the trade war between the United States and China is escalating with dizzying speed. Within hours both these countries announced massive tariffs against each other's products, and another round of tariffs was expected from the European Union. Something highly unusual was happening in the financial markets too, as stock and bond markets both started to collapse simultaneously. Usually these two move in opposite directions, because money pulled out of one goes into the other. A simultaneous plunge in both shows far deeper chaos gripping world markets.

Here are some things to note in order to get a handle on a fast-moving situation.

The bigger picture here is brutal in its simplicity, and critical in its importance.

First, the tariffs are not the result of lobbying by industry, agriculture or any other powerful vested interest in America, and they are almost universally denounced by the community of economists in American academia. You will be hard-pressed to find any voice outside of the Trump administration which thinks these tariffs are a good idea.

This is important, because it tells us that this is a madman's gambit. All earlier tariffs, including those brought by the famous Smoot-Hawley Act in 1930, came into being because of fierce industry lobbying for protection. This time it's the opposite. Industry, financial markets and academia are united in denouncing these tariffs as reckless. And with their actions, the markets are signaling their displeasure. The sell-offs in the stock and bond markets, the upgrading of the likelihood of a global recession, the closure of factories and layoffs of workers, all are expressions of deep disapproval and apprehension regarding the impact these tariffs are likely to have.

Second, if these tariffs, and the resultant trade war, are being pushed against the will of all-powerful vested interests in America, then what exactly is the big idea here? What do the architects of this policy hope to achieve?

There is a paper titled 'A User's Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System' written by a relatively unknown individual by the name of Stephen Miran. Published in November 2024, it lays all this out. Miran was subsequently picked by Trump to be the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisors and whereas he disagrees with the pace and intensity with which Trump is pursuing the tariffs, he lays out clearly in the paper why the policy is necessary.

In a nutshell, Miran argues that America is carrying a huge burden in providing a security umbrella to the world as well as its reserve asset, the US dollar. While the US had a dominant position in the world economy (back in the 1960s its share of global GDP was 40 per cent, he says, which has now shrunk to 26pc), the dollar as reserve currency helped America because they could print any amount of money to pay for their bills. But today as the rest of the world has powered on and America's share of global trade as well as global GDP has shrunk, the dollar as reserve asset has become a burden because other countries can devalue their currencies to cheapen their products in global markets but the US cannot.

To arrest this trend, the US can either take monetary measures (like attaching user fees to dollars held as reserves by other countries) or it can take trade measures through tariffs. He advocates for the latter, argues this is in opposition to what industry and academia wish, that it will be accompanied by a short-term asset price collapse, but eventually could bring America to a position where it can regain some of the ground it has lost to other countries.

Most importantly, he argues for intertwining security and trade relations. Since America provides the security and the reserve asset which underpins the global trade system, it is in a position to use both to arrest the erosion of its own position within this world. ""Countries that want to be inside the defense umbrella must also be inside the fair trade umbrella,"" he argues.

""Such a tool can be used to pressure other nations to join our tariffs against China, creating a multilateral approach toward tariffs. Forced to choose between facing a tariff on their exports to the American consumer or applying tariffs to their imports from China, which will they choose? ... The attempt to create a global tariff wall around China would increase the pressure on China to reform its economic system.""

The key takeaway here is that the tariffs are not about to go away soon, that the institutions which bailed Pakistan out historically could be on their way to disappearing, and that Pakistan could, in the near future, be forced to choose between the US and China. This calls for a comprehensive revamp of our economic strategy altogether. The new world dawning before us will admit neither import substitution orthodoxies nor faith in liberalisation and export-driven growth.

After constructive discussions in Colombo, Mr. Papageorgiou issued the following statement:

""Sri Lanka's ambitious reform agenda supported by the IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) continues to deliver commendable outcomes. The post-crisis growth rebound of 5 percent in 2024 is impressive. Inflation declined considerably in recent quarters and has fallen to ‐2.6 percent at end-March 2025. Gross official reserves increased to US$6.5 billion at end-March 2025 with sizeable foreign exchange purchases by the central bank. Substantial fiscal reforms have strengthened public finances.

""The recent external shock and evolving developments are creating uncertainty for the Sri Lankan economy, which is still recovering from its own economic crisis. More time is needed to assess the impact of the global shock and how its implications for Sri Lanka can be addressed within the contours of its IMF-supported program.

""The government's sustained commitment to program objectives is ensuring policy continuity and program implementation remains strong. Going forward, sustaining the reform momentum is critical to safeguard the hard-won gains of the program and put the economy on a path toward lasting macroeconomic stability and higher inclusive growth.

""Against increased global uncertainty, sustained revenue mobilization efforts and prudent budget execution in line with Budget 2025 are critical to preserve the limited fiscal space. Boosting tax compliance, including by reinstating an efficient and timely VAT refund mechanism, will help contribute to revenue gains without resorting to additional tax policy measures. Avoiding new tax exemptions will help reduce fiscal revenue leakages, corruption risks and build much needed fiscal buffers, including for social spending to support Sri Lanka's most vulnerable. Restoring cost recovery in electricity pricing will help minimize fiscal risks arising from the electricity state-owned enterprise.

""The government has an important responsibility to protect the poor and vulnerable at this uncertain time. It is important to redouble efforts to improve targeting, adequacy, and coverage of social safety nets. Fiscal support needs to be well-targeted, time-bound, and within the existing budget envelope.

""While inflation remains low, continued monitoring is warranted to ensure sustained price stability and support macroeconomic stability. Against ongoing global uncertainty, it remains important to continue rebuilding external buffers through reserves accumulation.

""Discussions are ongoing, and the authorities are encouraged to continue to make progress on restoring cost-recovery electricity pricing, strengthening the tax exemptions framework, and other important structural reforms.

""The IMF team held meetings with His Excellency President and Finance Minister Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Honorable Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya ; Honorable Labor Minister and Deputy Minister of Economic Development Prof. Anil Jayantha Fernando, Honorable Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning Dr. Harshana Suriyapperuma, Central Bank of Sri Lanka Governor Dr. P.

The journey began at Egmore station and continued along the eastern coast, crossing the iconic Pamban Bridge to reach Rameswaram.

From there, trains ran to Dhanushkodi, the southernmost rail point in India. A short ferry ride across the Palk Strait took travellers to Talaimannar in Sri Lanka, where they could board a train to Colombo.

This seamless route was disrupted in 1964, when a powerful cyclone devastated coastal Tamil Nadu. The storm, with wind speeds over 150 kmph, damaged the Pamban Rail Bridge and wiped out the railway line between Rameswaram and Dhanushkodi. Since then, trains have terminated at Rameswaram, and the ferry link to Sri Lanka has not resumed, as per a report by India Today.

Sixty years on, a new bridge may breathe life into that lost connection. On 6 April 2025, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a newly built Pamban Bridge, replacing the 110-year-old structure. The launch has revived hopes for a larger plan--a direct rail link between India and Sri Lanka.

The idea isn't new. During British rule, a proposal was made to connect the two countries by rail, as part of a broader plan to move goods and people efficiently across the empire.

In 1914, the South Indian Railway built the Pamban Bridge, enabling trains to reach Dhanushkodi. But the last segment--linking Dhanushkodi to Talaimannar--was never completed due to financial constraints and later global events like World War I.

Until the 1964 cyclone, a popular service called the Indo-Ceylon Boat Mail allowed passengers to travel from Chennai to Colombo through a combination of train and ferry.

The cyclone not only halted this unique journey but also buried the vision of direct rail connectivity between the two nations.

In recent years, discussions around this long-standing idea have resurfaced. A road-and-rail bridge or undersea tunnel across the Palk Strait--from Dhanushkodi to Talaimannar, just 25 km apart--has been considered. Multiple feasibility studies have been conducted. The success of the new Pamban Bridge could serve as a stepping stone to extending the rail line further.

In 2002, Sri Lanka proposed a road-cum-rail bridge linking Rameswaram and Talaimannar, but the plan was shelved due to opposition from Tamil Nadu's then-Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa, who raised security concerns.

Though the political climate has shifted, questions of security and cost remain. In 2015, India's Union Minister Nitin Gadkari pitched the project to the Asian Development Bank, which agreed to fund it. But Sri Lanka's transport minister later dismissed the proposal.

Fresh interest in the idea emerged in 2024. Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that a feasibility study on the project was nearing completion. A Sri Lankan official also suggested that India might fund the entire $5 billion project, although this was later downplayed by another minister.

Meanwhile, India has deepened its role in upgrading Sri Lanka's rail infrastructure. During PM Modi's recent visit, he and Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake inaugurated two India-assisted railway projects. India has also built and upgraded several other rail lines in the island nation.

Sri Lanka is the only neighbouring country that India does not share a rail link with. Existing links connect India to Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh, with plans for Bhutan in progress. Establishing a link with Sri Lanka could enhance trade, tourism, and cultural exchange, especially as both countries already share a Free Trade Agreement.

With growing focus on infrastructure, political realignment in Tamil Nadu, and renewed interest in regional connectivity, the dream of bridging the 25-kilometre gap between Dhanushkodi and Talaimannar might just move from paper to tracks. (Times Now)"

The Prime Minister made these remarks while addressing a public gathering held today (12th) in Nanattan, Mannar.

Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya further stated:

""Our country has reached a decisive point. The government of National People's Power (NPP) stands at understanding the expectations of the people. The general public came together despite the ethnic and religious barriers to exercise their voting right against the corruption in the politics that existed in this country. Consequently, Anura Kumara Dissanayake was able to become the President in 2024. A month later, we formed a Parliament that will initiate in changing the history. Today, we have a government made up of 159 members. There is now a strong group in Parliament standing against the corruption and a government that represents all ethnicities, religions, and regions. For the first time in history, we have formed a government made by a single party that represents everyone. The people are the ones who made this victory possible and they are the true victors in this cause.

We are committed to protecting the trust the people have placed in us and to fulfilling their expectations.

You are well aware of how weak the economy was when we came to power. Officially, we had been declared a bankrupt nation before the world. For many years, Sri Lanka had no economic growth and was in a debt-ridden economy. Tourism sector had been collapsed. Due to the corruption in political authority, investors were unwilling to invest the country. Today, we have changed all that. We have officially succeeded in removing the label of 'bankrupted'. We have managed to steer the economy towards growth leading the investments are being restored and the confidence in Sri Lanka has increased internationally.

We are working to start new projects in every area of Sri Lanka to bring the necessary investments to the rural sector, with the aim of improving the participation of rural communities in the national economy.

The first budget of the NPP government has passed. Even though the economy is not yet strong, we focused on two main priorities in the budget: one was to develop infrastructure necessary for economic growth, and the other was to provide relief to people burdened by economic hardships. That's why we have increased and extended the period of Aswesuma benefits. Further, for schools with lower than 300 students, vouchers to buy schoolbooks was distributed along with the government's intervention to strengthening the social protection system.

Previous governments were a burden to the people. But today, we have a very small Cabinet of members. The government is no longer a burden to people. We have reduced expenses, minimized losses, and eliminated the corruption.

Because of a government that is not a burden to the people, it was able to provide relief to the people. Through this budget, the basic salaries of public service have been increased. Now, the public service has become a much better place to earn a good income. They have been given the opportunity to work freely. Decisions for the people are now statistical data and not based on political preferences. What we expect is an independent public service. We are in need of a people-centered government as well as a public service and it should be an efficient, corruption-free, people-sensitive public service. We have already created the necessary environment for that.

In order to develop the rural economy, the government has allocated a large amount of funding through this year's budget but for that allocations are to be used properly for the purpose of serving people, the local government institutions are need to be cleaned up. If the leaders who represents the villages are corrupted, the allocation of fundings will become worthless. That is why the upcoming local government elections has become extremely significant and decisive.""

Over 50% of the income is allocated for prize money, while the remainder goes to the national treasury to support public welfare and development programs.

The statement noted that taxes and other institutional expenses are also covered through these revenues, making every official lottery ticket purchase a contribution towards the nation's progress.

The Board reiterated that illegal gambling schemes like ""Kotu Kapima"" serve only the interests of their operators and do not benefit the public in any way. The public is therefore strongly urged to avoid engaging in such schemes. (Newswire)"

The appeal follows a significant drop in electricity demand due to factory and office closures, coupled with high solar output under clear skies. This mismatch has created a serious risk of grid instability, as solar systems continue generating power without responding to demand levels.

Unlike traditional power plants, rooftop solar installations cannot be controlled by the CEB in real time and do not contribute to the critical ""inertia"" needed to stabilize electricity frequency. Inertia, typically provided by large spinning generators like hydro or thermal plants, helps prevent blackouts by absorbing fluctuations in supply and demand.

Data from April 12 shows that without CEB intervention, system inertia would have dropped to a dangerous 34%--well below safe operating limits. CEB managed to keep it at 56% by shutting down solar and carefully managing plant operations.

Until Sri Lanka deploys advanced grid-forming technology or large-scale battery storage, the country's electricity system will remain dependent on conventional power plants for stability. With only 100,000 rooftop solar owners out of 7 million total electricity consumers, CEB says this temporary curtailment is essential to avoid risks to the entire grid. (Newswire)"

Since ancient times, our people have marked the sun's transition from Pisces to Aries as the beginning of a New Year, also known as the Solar Festival. This season symbolizes abundance: trees bear fruit, harvests flourish, granaries overflow, and a sense of renewed hope and prosperity fills every heart.

The Sinhala and Tamil New Year is more than a festive occasion--it is a time that encourages us to act with discipline, uphold gratitude, and recognize the deep bond between humanity and nature. It also reminds us of the value of strong human relationships and inspires us to set aside differences and move forward with renewed spirit.

As we enter this New Year, we are met with both ongoing and emerging challenges.

Overcoming these and leading our country toward progress is a shared duty. In doing so, we must rise above narrow ideologies and divisions. By understanding the true spirit of this celebration, let us join hands in unity and resilience to face these challenges together, and step into a New Year marked by peace, joy, and prosperity.

Together, as one nation, let us navigate the road ahead, conquer adversity, and work toward a future of shared success. I call upon all Sri Lankans, both at home and abroad, to commit themselves to this hopeful journey--toward a New Year that brings happiness, not sorrow; unity, not division; and prosperity for all.

Wishing you a very Happy New Year filled with peace, happiness, and prosperity!

I extend my heartfelt wishes to the Sinhala and Tamil people of Sri Lanka, who celebrate the New Year in unity and generosity.

This New Year dawns at a moment when a new change is essential in every aspect of our lives. This traditional festivity reminds us to bring about positive change that is deep rooted in our culture and values, and move forward together in unity.

In recent years, the economic crisis made even the thought of celebrating the New Year a painful experience for many. However, the courageous efforts of the people to break free from a cycle of corruption and fraud, has led the path for the emergence of a new beginning.

Thus, the 2025 New Year marks a significant turning point. It is a year where communities from the North, South, East, and West unite and continue to work together under democratic principles to build a better future. In the upcoming month of May, the people's aspirations will once again bear fruit.

At this moment when a new chapter begins with the New Year, I urge every citizen to act with respect, peace, and compassion in community. Let us commit ourselves to move forward with dedication, trust, and resilience to achieve success and progress in the coming year.

To all Sri Lankans celebrating Sinhala and Tamil New Year, I wish the nation is blessed with the strength, unity, and new energy needed for meaningful transformation and a prosperous tomorrow.

As we celebrate the Sinhala and Tamil New Year this year, a festival that symbolises the hope of both physical and spiritual renewal, our nation finds itself at a defining moment, achieving significant victories while resolutely striving towards the realisation of a better and more prosperous future.

It is with profound joy and gratitude that I reflect upon the efforts undertaken by the National People's Power government over the past months to lift our nation from adversity and steer it towards economic, social and political advancement. The successes we have thus far achieved rightfully belong to the people of this country, whose steadfast trust, as expressed in the most recent Presidential and General Elections, has been the driving force behind this transformative journey.

As a responsible government, we possess the strength and determination to further deepen our commitment to the nation, even amidst formidable challenges. We are implementing well-considered plans to address the multifaceted challenges confronting our country, both in terms of national development and within the broader geopolitical landscape.

The Sinhala and Tamil New Year traditions beautifully reflect the harmony between humanity and nature, bearing witness to the deep-rooted history of coexistence between our Sinhala and Tamil communities. While contemporary society may be burdened by various divisions, occasions such as the New Year provide a timely reminder of the enduring values of unity, harmony and peaceful coexistence. It is our solemn responsibility, particularly at this time of renewal, to nurture those values within ourselves and to foster a more compassionate and ethical society.

Moreover, the rituals associated with the sun's transition are underpinned by the universal aspiration to create a renewed individual, one free from outdated thoughts and attitudes. The New Year, therefore, offers us an invaluable opportunity to embrace renewal in our own lives.

As we welcome this New Year, I call upon all of you to come together with renewed strength, unity and goodwill. Let us collectively work towards a common purpose, supporting the government's vision for economic, social and political transformation and thereby ensuring enduring progress and prosperity for our country and all its people.

May this New Year bring you and your loved ones peace, happiness, renewed hope and abundant prosperity in your journey towards 'A Thriving Nation - A Beautiful Life"".
