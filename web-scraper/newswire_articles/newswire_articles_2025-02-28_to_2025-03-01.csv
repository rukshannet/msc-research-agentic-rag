Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya's full speech at the launch event:

It is a pleasure to address you on this significant occasion of launching the Action Plan on Renewable Energy Management. We are not just here to launch this project; we are here to transform our country into an energy powerhouse for the future. The Ceylon Electricity Board and the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority have taken the lead in steering Sri Lanka towards sustainable energy solutions.

I am pleased that the Ministry of Energy has introduced a valuable five-year action plan, the Green Energy Acceleration Plan 2025-2030. This initiative will promote sustainable energy consumption, identify renewable energy sources, and provide a comprehensive understanding of energy conservation and storage methods.

The primary objective of this plan is to reduce electricity demand and lower the initial cost of electricity in Sri Lanka by identifying and promoting the use of renewable energy sources.

Our goal is to expand renewable energy production over the next five years and provide affordable electricity to all Sri Lankans. We aim to reform our energy acts in three key areas.

First, we will ensure the provision of affordable and reliable energy through renewable sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower while minimizing carbon emissions. Second, we will focus on educating the public on the significance of renewable energy and digital technologies and their role in accessing modern and reliable energy. Third, we will introduce advanced energy conversion methods to modernize the energy sector, aligning Sri Lanka with global advancements in the field.

This is not just a plan; it is a roadmap for the next five years. It encompasses various aspects, including the identification and development of energy sources, public awareness initiatives, implementation timelines, allocated funding, and necessary legal frameworks.

To ensure the success of this project, it is essential to leverage both local and international partnerships. Let us work together to meet the energy needs of all Sri Lankans using renewable energy solutions. (Newswire)"

Officials representing the Ministry of Finance revealed that this represents an achievement, with revenue collection reaching 99.1% of the anticipated target for 2024, the highest recorded percentage in history.

The officials disclosed this information while presenting the state financial performance for the years 2023 and 2024 during a meeting of the Committee on Public Finance held on Tuesday (25 Feb), Chaired by MP Harsha de Silva.

Value Added Tax (VAT) :

According to the Finance Ministry officials, the increase in VAT rates and the removal of tax concessions on 95 out of 137 previously VAT-exempt items contributed to this outcome. Stating that additionally, maintaining higher fiscal discipline compared to previous years has been a key factor in achieving this success, they emphasized that this discipline could be further strengthened in the future. Addressing the meeting, MP Harsha de Silva emphasized that the reason for this is the financial discipline created through the legal provisions under the Public Financial Management Act. He further underscored the importance of maintaining such fiscal discipline in the long run to ensure economic progress.

Revenue and grants-to-GDP ratio :

The officials of the Ministry of Finance stated that the revenue and grants-to-GDP ratio, which stands at 13.6% in 2024, is expected to reach 15.3% by 2029. However, the Committee pointed out that this projected figure for 2029 is still insufficient, as the average for middle-income countries is approximately 20%. The need to improve tax administration to enhance this situation was emphasized during the meeting. Moreover, the officials highlighted that, in addition to proper tax administration, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have been introduced for institutions such as the Inland Revenue Department, Sri Lanka Customs, and the Excise Department, with the expectation of achieving these targets accordingly.

""Citizen's Budget"" :

During the meeting, officials also presented a summary of the ""Citizen's Budget"" to the Committee, making the current budget more understandable to the general public. This summary detailed the allocation of funds for 12 sectors, including health, education, and transportation etc. The officials stated that the objective of this initiative is to ensure greater transparency, enabling taxpayers to understand how their tax contributions are being utilized by the government. The Committee instructed officials to present this ""Citizen's Budget"" report in comparison with 2024 figures under the Public Financial Management Act. Furthermore, the Committee commended the officials of the Ministry of Finance and the Department of Government Printing for preparing the report in a manner that is accessible and engaging to the general public.

Tax revenue from vehicle imports :

The Committee questioned whether the expected revenue of approximately Rs. 330 billion could realistically be achieved, given that only Rs. 83 million in Letters of Credit has been opened thus far, as reported in the media. Officials responded that the high taxes imposed on vehicle imports would enable the achievement of this revenue target. The Committee Chair further instructed officials to provide regular updates on this projected revenue to the Committee.

Losses of state-owned enterprises :

The officials provided details on the profits and losses of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) from January to October 2024. It was disclosed that SriLankan Airlines had incurred a significant loss during this period, while the total profit generated by 52 state-owned enterprises amounted to Rs. 428 billion. In contrast, the total losses incurred by SOEs in 2022 amounted to Rs.774 billion.

Agricultural warehouse project in Dambulla :

The Committee Chair also raised concerns regarding the agricultural warehouse project in Dambulla, which was initiated in 2019 but has yet to be operational. Despite the completion of all construction work, delays in procuring refrigeration units have caused a setback in launching this project. The officials confirmed that the warehouse was constructed with a grant from India. The Chair of the Committee emphasized that failing to make this facility available to farmers is a significant issue and urged immediate action to operationalize it.

Colombo National Art Gallery :

Attention was drawn to the five-year closure of the National Art Gallery, Colombo. It was revealed that Rs. 120 million has been allocated for its renovations, but delays in the procurement process have hindered its reopening. The Committee Chair urged the relevant authorities to expedite the necessary work to reopen the facility to the public as soon as possible.

Public debt:

Given that a separate law has been enacted for debt management, the importance of effectively implementing its provisions was stressed. The Committee Chair, MP Harsha de Silva emphasized the need to recruit highly skilled professionals to ensure efficient public debt management. (Newswire)"

On page 31, instead of Talaimannar it says something else. English spelling is wrong! What an embarrassment."" Rahman said the errors were an embarrassment to the government and criticized the removal of key security elements.

""In the old passport, the first page contained the passport number, which could be verified using ultraviolet technology. Under UV light, it turned red, serving as a built-in security feature. The new passport lacks this and instead only includes the personalized data page, which can be altered. This compromises security in the new blue passport. How did this happen? Were the controllers even involved?"" he questioned.

The MP warned that if taken to court, the government might be forced to recall and reissue passports. He also noted the removal of pages for alterations, endorsements, and foreign exchange transactions.

""People are paying Rs. 20,000 for a passport of such low quality, where the ink transfers when stamped,"" he added. (Newswire)"

Addressing the Parliament yesterday, Minister Jayatissa said that the 49 months governed by the Gotabaya Rajapaksa- Ranil Wickremesinghe governments have seen over Rs. 377.3 million spent just for the Chief Government Whip's Office.

He further said that the appointments to the former Chief Government Whip's Office include the Chief Government Whip, two Deputy organizers and three Assistant Organizers.

""Prasanna Ranatunga held the post of Chief Government Whip. The Deputy Organizers were Sagara Kariyawasam and Jayantha Ketagoda, while the Assistant Organizers were Kokila Harshini Gunawardena, Janaka Tissa Kuttiarachchi, and Madura Vithanage,"" he revealed.

Stating that a government representative refers to a Cabinet Minister who is provided with a vehicle, fuel allowance and salary from the relevant ministry, Minister Jayatissa said these Deputy and Assistant Organizers had also received similar privileges under the former regime.

""When preparing the NPP government's budget, it was found that the Chief Government Whip was provided Rs. 16,250 as an additional allowance and 600 litres of fuel for a vehicle. The Deputy Organizers have been provided with facilities similar to that granted to a Deputy Minister, while Assistant Organizers were granted facilities similar to that of the personal staff of a Deputy Minister,"" he said.

Minister Jayatissa said that while a Deputy Organizer is entitled to a team of 15 persons, the previous Deputy Organizers held teams consisting of 30 personnel each, adding that the Assistant Organizers also held a team of 30 personnel, apart from the team offered by the Parliament.

He further alleged that these roles have been granted by the former regime using Parliamentary funds to appease party members who were not given ministerial posts.

Announcing that the NPP Government has also made appointments to the Chief Government Whip's Office, MP Jayatissa said he will operate as the Chief Government Whip, while two Deputy Organizers and one Assistant Organizer have been appointed.

He informed the Parliament that the five persons appointed to the Chief Government Whip's Office would be working without obtaining the privileges taken by the previous appointments, such as vehicles or fuel allowances.

Minister Jayatissa further said that the expense incurred by the current Chief Government Whip's Office was Rs. 1.8 million for January, which was significantly less than that spent under the previous regime. (Newswire)"

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/02/28/chinas-struggle-with-polluted-farmland-environmental-cost-of-rapid-growth/,2025-02-28,China's Struggle with Polluted Farmland : Environmental Cost of Rapid Growth,"China's rapid industrialization over the past few decades has brought significant economic growth and transformed the nation into a global powerhouse. However, this progress has come at a steep environmental cost, particularly in the agricultural sector. The excessive use of urea, pesticides and other chemicals has led to severe pollution of the land and underground water, resulting in widespread contamination of crops. This has rendered approximately 20% of China's agricultural land infertile and a significant portion of the underground water poisonous. As a result, China has been compelled to seek agricultural land on contract in other countries to feed its vast population.

The environmental degradation in China began with the Green Revolution in the 1960s and 1970s, which aimed to increase agricultural productivity through the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and high-yield crop varieties. While this led to substantial gains in food production, it also set the stage for the unsustainable agricultural practices that followed. The reliance on chemical inputs increased over the years, driven by the need to meet the growing food demands of a rapidly expanding population.

Urea, a nitrogen-based fertilizer, became the cornerstone of China's agricultural strategy. Farmers were encouraged to use urea liberally to boost crop yields. However, the excessive application of urea had unintended consequences. Nitrogen from urea leached into the soil and groundwater, causing widespread contamination. The high nitrogen levels in the soil disrupted the natural nutrient balance, leading to soil acidification and reduced fertility. As a result, the once-productive agricultural land became barren and unfit for cultivation.

The situation was further exacerbated by the rampant use of pesticides. Farmers, driven by the need to protect their crops from pests and diseases, resorted to using large quantities of chemical pesticides. These pesticides not only killed harmful pests but also decimated beneficial insects and microorganisms that played a crucial role in maintaining soil health. The overuse of pesticides led to the development of pesticide-resistant pests, prompting farmers to apply even more toxic chemicals. This vicious cycle of pesticide use resulted in the accumulation of harmful residues in the soil and water, contributing to the overall degradation of the environment.

The combined effect of urea and pesticide pollution has had a devastating impact on China's underground water resources. The excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has led to the infiltration of toxic substances into the groundwater. Studies have shown that a significant portion of China's groundwater is contaminated with high levels of nitrates, heavy metals, and pesticide residues. This contamination poses serious health risks to the population, as many rural communities rely on groundwater for drinking and irrigation purposes.

The contamination of agricultural land and underground water has also affected the quality of crops grown in China. Crops grown on polluted land absorb toxic substances from the soil and water, leading to the production of contaminated food. This has raised concerns about food safety and public health, as consumers are exposed to harmful chemicals through their diet. The widespread contamination of crops has eroded consumer trust in domestically produced food, prompting a shift towards imported food products.

As a consequence of the environmental degradation, China has faced a significant reduction in its agricultural land. With approximately 20% of the arable land rendered infertile, the country has been forced to look for alternative solutions to meet its food demands. One such solution has been to secure agricultural land on contract in other countries. China has entered into agreements with several countries, including those in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, to lease or purchase agricultural land for food production. This strategy, often referred to as ""land grabbing,"" has allowed China to maintain a steady supply of food for its population while mitigating the impact of its domestic land degradation.

However, the practice of acquiring agricultural land in other countries has raised ethical and political concerns. Critics argue that China's land acquisition strategy exploits the natural resources of poorer nations, often at the expense of local communities and ecosystems. The displacement of local farmers, loss of biodiversity, and potential for social conflicts have sparked debates about the sustainability and fairness of such practices.

In response to the environmental challenges, the Chinese government has implemented several measures to address land and water pollution. Initiatives to promote sustainable farming practices, reduce chemical inputs, and rehabilitate degraded land have been introduced. Efforts to improve water quality through stricter regulations and monitoring have also been undertaken. While these measures show promise, the road to reversing the damage caused by decades of unsustainable agricultural practices is long and arduous.

China's excessive use of urea and pesticides has led to severe pollution of land and underground water, rendering a significant portion of its agricultural land infertile. The contamination of crops and reduction in arable land have forced China to seek agricultural land on contract in other countries to feed its population. While efforts to address the environmental damage are underway, the long-term sustainability of China's agricultural sector remains uncertain. The challenges posed by land and water pollution underscore the need for a comprehensive and holistic approach to environmental stewardship and sustainable agriculture. (Foreign Media)

The census is set for March 15, during which farmers will have five minutes to count these animals on their properties.

""Sixteen percent of Sri Lanka's total land area belongs to wildlife. We must understand why these animals leave their natural habitats and encroach on farmlands. Without addressing this, we cannot resolve the issue,"" Karunaratne stated.

The order comes amid an ongoing investigation into the fatal shooting incident that occurred near the W15 Hotel in Weligama on December 31, 2023, which resulted in the death of a Police officer and injuries to another.

The court had previously directed the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to arrest and produce Tennakoon, along with eight other Police officers, as suspects in the case. However, Deputy Minister of Public Security Sunil Watagala recently stated in Parliament that Tennakoon is currently in hiding.

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake also commented on the situation, revealing that a key suspect had gone missing after leaving his residence without his security officer. While he did not name the individual, it is widely believed he was referring to Deshabandu Tennakoon.

Key Takeaways from President Anura Kumara Dissanayake's Speech on Defence & Public Security (2025 Budget Debate)

1.  Government Stability & Economy - Despite speculation about an economic collapse and efforts to create instability, Sri Lanka's economy is stabilizing, with positive IMF reviews confirming steady progress.

I am very pleased to have the opportunity to present a few points during this debate regarding the expenditure headings of both the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of Defence.

I observed that in recent parliamentary discussions, concerns were raised regarding a significant threat to national security and the widespread fear among the public. Some have raised questions regarding the government's resignation and the transfer of responsibility to another party. If we look at how this issue was raised, it takes us back to the post-presidential election period when, after securing a victory in the presidential election, there was a project initiated by certain individuals claiming that it would not be possible to form a strong government following the presidential election. Despite the fact that these individuals claimed a strong government could be formed, I believe the Prime Minister's position and ministerial portfolios were allocated at that time. However, although it was anticipated that the victory in the presidential election could be overturned, the National People's Power secured an even more decisive victory in the subsequent general election.

By March, there were widespread speculations that the economy would face a severe crisis, potentially leading to a change in government. However, today, the government is submitting its third review report to the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), from which highly positive outcomes are expected. This demonstrates that the country's economy is progressing towards a more stable and robust position.

There were concerns that opening vehicle imports would place significant pressure on the dollar, leading to an uncontrollable increase in its value. However, the value of the dollar has, in fact, been declining. If anyone believed that an economic crisis could be used to seize power, that prospect has now dissipated.

Historically, governments have collapsed due to economic crises, but this will not be the case now. Any hopes of toppling the government through an economic downturn are merely wishful thinking. Similarly, attempts to create internal conflicts within political parties to destabilize the government have occurred in the past, but this administration does not face any such internal opposition. Consequently, the government cannot be overthrown by internal crises either. Some anticipate that the government will fall due to severe threats to national security, but that, too, will not happen.

In the past, public protests have led to the removal of ruling parties. However, apart from media discussions and parliamentary debates, there is currently no indication that the public is rallying for change. Any attempts to overthrow the government through mass protests will be unsuccessful.

There are on-going efforts to create a perception that national security is under threat, that the public is in danger, and that the government is incapable of ensuring their safety, thereby justifying a change in leadership. However, no ordinary citizen has been affected by underworld conflicts. While these conflicts have generated some fear within society, daily life remains unaffected.

Two primary factors that have historically threatened national security are ethnic nationalism and extremism. Long-term conflicts, including the civil war and the Easter Sunday attacks, stemmed from these elements. We will not allow nationalism and extremism to take root in the country again.

Regarding the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), while we remain committed to its removal, there is a need for a legal framework to address organized crime and extremist tendencies. Without such measures, criminal gangs would continue to grow unchecked. Therefore, we are preparing a new legal framework to replace the PTA and have already appointed a committee to oversee this process. The realization of this long-standing public demand is being undertaken solely by this government.

Organized crime syndicates are not merely groups of criminals but have thrived under political protection. Certain political leaders have nurtured and safeguarded these gangs. Today, those who once shielded these criminals are shedding crocodile tears over their activities. The political authority behind these criminal networks allowed them to operate fearlessly, even compromising law enforcement institutions.

For example, among those arrested in connection with the murder in Weeraketiya involving two children, a police constable was identified. Similarly, two police officers were among those arrested for the shooting incident at the Colombo courts. In Mount Levinia, T-56 rifles were seized from the police and handed over to criminal syndicates. This highlights the complicity of certain police factions and political networks in fostering organized crime. Furthermore, state-issued weapons have found their way into the hands of underworld gangs. A former president's child was reportedly provided with seven government-issued firearms. Our country has experienced administrations that lacked accountability in governance.

Consequently, the country has been transformed into a shadow criminal state. While we see a functioning police force, military, political authority and judiciary on the surface, beneath this structure exists an armed underworld with ties to law enforcement, security forces and legal professionals. This shadow state must be dismantled.

There are two approaches to dealing with this issue: either aligning with the criminal underworld or decisively eliminating it. Unlike previous administrations, which coexisted with organized crime, the NPP-led government is determined to eradicate it entirely. Therefore, I assure you that no one in this administration will provide protection, security, or support to any criminal organization or its members.

Recently, the police have made significant progress in apprehending criminals and seizing illegal firearms. Corrupt police officers involved in criminal activities have also been arrested. The criminal network must be dismantled layer by layer. This government is not interested in political appointments within the police force. Neither I nor any member of the administration has attempted to appoint police officers based on personal preference.

If intelligence reports indicate that certain police officers have protected criminal organizations, and if the public expresses concerns about such associations, those officers must be reassigned. This is not a politically motivated action but a necessary step to break the connection between law enforcement and organized crime. Just as political protection for these gangs must end, the institutional networks supporting them must also be dismantled. The public demands the eradication of organized crime, and the NPP-led government is the only administration committed to fulfilling that demand.

Recent events indicate a coordinated effort by criminal gangs to act simultaneously. Analysis of incidents such as the Middeniya murder, the shooting at the Hulftsdorp Courts, and crimes in Kotahena, Uswetakeiyawa, Mount Levinia and shooting incident in Minuwangoda suggests an organized plan behind these acts. When we consider these six incidents, except for the Minuwangoda crime, the others seem to be routine criminal acts. This suggests that organized crime groups have been actively involved. Some individuals have established armed groups that they can control. Similar groups have been formed in certain regions, such as Batticaloa and Jaffna. This indicates that there is a strategic attempt to mobilize these criminal elements at the same time.

When expectations of an economic collapse fail to materialize, the anticipation that the government will fall into crisis also collapses. Similarly, when the expectation that the government will fall through public protests is shattered, the organized and separate operations of armed gangs and criminal groups now unfold systematically. However, a justifiable suspicion remains about whether these activities are being orchestrated by a single hand. Some reports have been received in this regard, and we are conducting investigations accordingly.

We are aware that investigations into fraud and corruption are currently underway. These investigations are leading to formal charges being filed in the High Court. Recently, a large number of cases have been filed, including the ""Krish"" case and the ""SriLankan Airlines"" case, both of which are expected to be quickly brought to court. Additionally, investigations into the Easter attacks are on-going. None of these investigations are being discussed in the media or presented in Parliament. We report the status of these investigations directly to the judiciary. Publicizing the status of investigations through the media is an attempt to conceal the truth, which we avoid doing.

As a government, we operate with professionalism. This is why we are conducting investigations into criminal activities. The murder of Lasantha Wickrematunge occurred 16 years ago, and it remains unsolved. Despite the general public having an idea about how it occurred, such speculations are of no use in court. The judicial system requires concrete evidence that goes beyond mere suspicion, which is challenging to gather after 16 years. However, we are committed to doing so.

The best opportunity to bring these criminals to justice was in 2015 when investigations were fresh. However, that did not happen. It took almost a decade for a file to be submitted to the Legal Department for a response. This delay was not the fault of the Attorney General's Department, but rather due to the political pressures within the administration. This is the reality that must be accepted. Even though the opposition may not have succeeded in toppling the government, you are not acting on the true facts that are unfolding.

We will not allow criminals to act with impunity. Our responsibility is to ensure justice for the victims and citizens of this country. We approach this responsibility with the utmost seriousness, ensuring that no injustices occur. We urge you to trust our leaders, who are committed to professionalism. Support us in this endeavour. Engage in politics during elections, but the actions we take to eliminate corruption must move forward with determination.

As investigations progress, we remain vigilant in ensuring that the focus of these inquiries is not manipulated. Whether it is the SriLankan Airlines case or the Easter attacks, criminals are aware of where the investigations are directed. This raises a justifiable suspicion that such instability may be deliberately created by the criminals involved. In response, we have directed the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and intelligence agencies to remain alert to the possibility of organized criminal activity. If necessary, we are prepared to identify and act upon any further developments.

This is not a national or public security threat, but rather a momentary surge in organized crime. We are taking swift measures to curb it.

We have established a new security council, which is a fact. The old path can be followed with the old people. However, to embark on a new journey, new individuals are required. While old friendships and alliances may exist, we are transforming all of this into a professional military force. The Chief of Defence Staff had been granted seven service extensions, and he has remained in his position as part of his close circle. However, these appointments are not made for the benefit of our personal interests or our friends. Our country's police department and the Tri-forces must be established as professional forces.

There were plans to appoint the Chief of Defence Staff as the successor to the President. The Chief of State Intelligence Service was granted two extensions to their service. At that time, it was not professionalism but rather political favouritism. We are not creating an army of political affiliates. Instead of a politically biased army, we are building a professional military force that is loyal to the state.

Our vision is to develop a technologically advanced military with a smaller yet more effective force by 2030. We plan to limit the size of our army to 100,000, the Air Force to 18,000, and the Navy to 40,000. While the overall size will decrease, we are working to transform our military into a more technologically advanced force. Our goal is to modernize the military by providing advanced equipment and developing a highly skilled, professional force. They will not be a politically biased army but a military loyal to the state.

We are also prepared to allocate the necessary funds for foreign training for our military. A significant amount has already been spent on the modernization of aircraft. Additionally, we recognize the need for a more active and well-trained police department. To address this, we have allocated a considerable amount of funds. We expect to allocate 1000 millions to provide the necessary vehicles for the police and improve facilities at police stations. Furthermore, we have increased allowances. As a result, we plan to establish a police department that can operate with a free mind-set. We are also in the process of recruiting 10,000 new officers into the police force.

Our country is working towards a transition from an uncivilized state to one of civility. Institutions responsible for security must fulfil this role with dignity and professionalism. Therefore, we are revitalizing our national institutions, ensuring they meet their responsibilities, and driving this transformation forward. The position of IGP can change today, tomorrow, or at any time, but the focus should be on the institutions rather than individuals. We must trust in the institutional system and progress toward civility.

I invite everyone to join in this transformation, as we work to elevate our state from the depths of inhumanity to civility. Embrace civility and reject inhumanity. If anyone rejects civility, it must be made clear that they will inevitably be discarded from the new political landscape we are building.

Should there have been a political system in Sri Lanka rooted in indecency, it is important to remember that after the rule of the NPP government, the country will not revert to such politics. This marks a pivotal turning point. If you seek political power, I encourage you to aspire to a level of civility that surpasses the current standard. The divisive politics of the past is no longer acceptable to the enlightened people of this nation. As such, the era of gaining political power through manipulation and conspiracies has come to an end. The period of leveraging nationalism and religious prejudice for political gain is over. Moving forward, the only conversation within the political arena will be focused on the establishment of a civility that exceeds the one we have already established.

Moving forward, there will be no room for the kind of politics that would drag our country back. We are introducing a system with sound leaders that society can accept. I observed that one president spent 3.5 million on a trip abroad, which is not an issue. Yet, questions arise when consider how 1.8 billion was spent. If you're not ready to change, it is clear you remain entrenched in out-dated, traditional political discussions, which have failed in the past. These discussions are a political fossil. Our country's politics need to evolve to a new level, and we are ready to engage in that new dialogue. We are a group of people prepared to embrace any positive change. If Sri Lankan politics has been characterized by corruption in the past, let me assure you today that under the government of the National People's Force, this era of corrupt leadership has come to an end. There should be no doubt about that.

This brings the total IMF financial support disbursed so far to SDR 1.02 billion (about US$1.34 billion).

The EFF arrangement for Sri Lanka was approved by the Executive Board on March 20, 2023 (see Press Release No. 23/79) in an amount of SDR 2.286 billion (395 percent of quota or about US$3 billion. The program supports Sri Lanka's efforts to restore and maintain macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability while protecting the poor and vulnerable, rebuild external buffers, and enhance growth-oriented structural reforms including by strengthening governance.

Following the Executive Board discussion on Sri Lanka, Mr. Kenji Okamura, Deputy Managing Director, issued the following statement:

""Reforms in Sri Lanka are bearing fruit and the economic recovery has been remarkable. Inflation remains low, revenue collection is improving, and reserves continue to accumulate. Economic growth averaged 4.3 percent since growth resumed in the third quarter of 2023. By end-2024, Sri Lanka's real GDP is estimated to have recovered 40 percent of its loss incurred between 2018 and 2023. The recovery is expected to continue in 2025. As the economy is still vulnerable, it is critical to sustain the reform momentum to ensure macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, and promote long-term inclusive growth. There is no room for policy errors.

""Program performance has been strong with all quantitative targets met, except for the indicative target on social spending. Most structural benchmarks due by end-January 2025 were either met or implemented with delay.

""Sustained revenue mobilization is crucial to restoring fiscal sustainability and ensuring that the government can continue to provide essential services. Boosting tax compliance and refraining from tax exemptions are key to maintaining support for economic reforms. To ease economic hardship and ensure the poor and vulnerable can participate in Sri Lanka's recovery it is important to meet social spending targets and continue with reforms of the social safety net. Going forward, social support needs to be well-targeted towards the most disadvantaged so as to promote inclusive growth with limited fiscal space. Restoring cost-recovery electricity pricing without delay is needed to contain fiscal risks from state-owned enterprises. A smoother execution of capital spending within the fiscal envelope would foster medium-term growth.

""The progress to advance the debt restructuring to restore Sri Lanka's debt sustainability is noteworthy. The recent successful completion of the bond exchange is a major milestone towards restoring debt sustainability. Timely finalization of bilateral agreements with creditors in the Official Creditor Committee and with remaining creditors is a priority now.

""Monetary policy should prioritize maintaining price stability, supported by sustained commitment to prohibit monetary financing and safeguard Central Bank independence. Continued exchange rate flexibility and gradually phasing out the balance of payments measures remain critical to rebuild external buffers and facilitate rebalancing.

""Resolving non-performing loans, strengthening governance and oversight of state-owned banks, and improving the insolvency and resolution frameworks are important priorities to revive credit growth and support the economic recovery.

""Prolonged structural challenges need to be addressed to unlock Sri Lanka's long-term potential, including steadfast implementation of the governance reforms.""


* The IMF Executive Board completed the Third Review under the 48-month Extended Fund Facility with Sri Lanka, providing the country with immediate access to SDR 254 million (about US $334 million) to support its economic policies and reforms.
* Performance under the program has been strong. All quantitative targets for end-December 2024 were met, except the indicative target on social spending. Most structural benchmarks due by end-January 2025 were either met or implemented with delay. The recent successful completion of the bond exchange is a major milestone towards restoring debt sustainability.

* Reform efforts are bearing fruit with the recovery gaining momentum. As the economy is still vulnerable, sustaining the reform agenda is critical to put the economy on a path towards lasting recovery and debt sustainability."
