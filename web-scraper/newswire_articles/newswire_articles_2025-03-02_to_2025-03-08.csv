Question : Talking about the future of South Asia and particularly the relationship between India and Sri Lanka, how do you envisage it in wake of the new government that has been formed recently, and of course the Prime Minister first coming to India after his election?

Wickremesinghe: Generally the president and the Prime Minister makes their first visits to India. I don't know whether they were ready to take over the government, but what I have done is I've spoken with Prime Minister Modi. When we were in trouble, you all gave us four-and a half billion dollars, and with that on side, I could handle the economy. With China and Japan, the rules were stricter for them, and they couldn't give to a country that's bankrupt. One was because of our trade agreements and secondly because of the neighborhood first policy we got this money. I don't think many others can, maybe Maldives or any other other countries. Sri Lanka getting out of bankruptcy was not sufficient; we also have a deficit in our foreign exchange earnings, so how do we work together? so, prime minister Modi and I spoke and we put all our projects together. I was trying to give 25 Gigawatts or even 50 (if we could do it) of renewable energy so that both our economies would have benefitted. Secondly was to make Trincomalee the regional logistic hub with the pipeline coming in from, in Nagapattinam and us putting up a refinery there and developing it. So we were thinking in terms of developing that cluster, and then I was looking at how we can develop this corridor which could have linked Madurai in the south of Tamil Nadu up to Trincomalee. So these are the issues that are there. Unfortunately, we seem to be having some problems with the first project we had -the wind power project, but I think that should go through. So let's uh let's see what the government works out. I think I want to take the matter up with the government and say that don't look at these as individual projects but look at it as one big program which can send us into a trillion dollar economy. We can't do it otherwise. But if we go along with India and also with Indonesia and Thailand, even Bangladesh, we are certainly into it.

Question : I also want to understand from you what is your perspective when it comes to China having massive influence in the subcontinent and particularly Sri Lanka because just a few months ago we saw those ships that had been sent by the Chinese on the ports of Sri Lanka, the so-called research vessels that had caused concern for India. Then we talk about the 99-year-old Hambantota lease, when we talk about the Colombo Port that is at this point of time being built by the Chinese. Are these real concerns that the Sri Lankan regime is looking to delve deeper into?

Wickremesinghe: As far as the survey ships were there, it was being done by China and some others, but I sort of stopped it for the time being to look at it and then I found that other countries were doing surveys in Sri Lanka and we were not getting the commercial benefit of it and that we should bring in a law to ensure that we had the commercial benefits and (that there) were genuinely commercial events that came along. So I had stopped it and I was hoping for Parliament to go into it but even there was a concern that some of the surveys were not commercial. My concerns went even bigger: if I don't benefit why should I allow you to be in my sea? So we had stopped that and I think it's being reviewed. Now, in Colombo, what has happened is that China has got one of the terminals and the other terminal has gone to Adani. So we'll have both of those. As for Hambantota, I'm the one who handled the deal but at Hambantota, they can run a commercial enterprise only. A Southern command has to be shifted from Galle, the Navy's Southern command into Hambantota, and we already have a brigade headquarters in Hambantota, and we are strengthening the anti-submarine capacity of our Navy.

The Chamber is particularly pleased to note that two key macroeconomic priorities outlined in its 10-Point Focused Plan of Implementation in the first six months for the new Government (published in September 2024) have been realised:

1. The completion of external debt restructuring.

2. The implementation of credible fiscal policy changes, as reflected in the 2025 National Budget.

As Sri Lanka enters the second half of its four-year IMF programme, it is crucial that the Government accelerates the implementation of structural reforms essential for sustainable growth.

Trade facilitation reforms, including the National Single Window and the new Customs Act.

Advancing Digital ID and Digital Public Infrastructure.

Enacting critical legislation such as the Economic Transformation Act.

Strengthening governance reforms to enhance the investment and business environment.

Widening the tax net to achieve the fiscal targets through improved revenue administration and digitalisation.

Government Spokesman Minister Nalinda Jayathissa stated that there would be no reversal of the decision, which aims to eliminate excessive payments.

The fuel distribution situation across the country has returned to normal, with the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) confirming that fuel supplies were doubled yesterday to mitigate shortages. CPC Chairman Janaka Rajakaruna assured that there is no risk of fuel shortages and urged the public to refrain from panic buying.

However, the Petroleum Distributors Association has warned of potential operational changes if the government does not reconsider its decision. The association stated that distributors might stop accepting bank and credit card payments, reduce staff, and close fuel stations earlier to cut costs. A crucial meeting with the CPC Chairman is scheduled for Tuesday to discuss the issue further.

The dispute arose after the CPC revised the fuel pricing formula, reducing the commission for distributors from 3% to approximately 1.7%. Distributors claim this move has slashed their profits by over 43%, making operations unsustainable. As a form of protest, nearly 500 fuel station owners suspended credit sales to government institutions while also halting fresh fuel orders, triggering long queues at fuel stations over the weekend.

Despite these claims, CPC Chairman Rajakaruna dismissed concerns, stating that the revised formula still allows distributors to make a reasonable profit. He also said that the government remains committed to ensuring fuel affordability for the public rather than subsidizing commissions for private distributors. (NewsWire)"
https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/02/sacred-event-after-16-years-president-akds-message/,2025-03-02,Sacred event after 16 years : President AKD's message,"By President Anura Kumara Dissanayake

As per my request to the Mahanayake Theras, it has been decided to hold a special exposition of the Sacred Tooth Relic for the general public from April 18th to 27th.

Accordingly, the special exposition is planned to take place from 3:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. on April 18th, and from 12:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. from April 19th to 27th. A preliminary discussion in this regard was held today (02) at the President's House in Kandy.

I expressed my gratitude to the Mahanayake Theras for granting the Buddhist community of Sri Lanka the opportunity to partake in this sacred event after 16 years. I emphasized that the Buddhist people of Sri Lanka aspire to see the Sacred Tooth Relic revered and worshipped throughout their lifetime.

Furthermore, I stated that this occasion is expected to contribute to the re-establishment of cultural and religious values that are gradually diminishing within the country, and I hope this event will foster religious and cultural awareness. I also expressed my belief that this special exposition of the Sacred Tooth Relic, organized as an extension of the New Year celebrations, will direct the country towards a new direction by promoting Buddhist awareness nationwide.

I hope that a large number of people will participate in the exposition of the Sacred Tooth Relic, which will be held for ten days. It is my belief that it is the responsibility of everyone to ensure that the devotees are given the opportunity to worship the Sacred Tooth Relic without any obstacles. As the government, I will provide maximum support and intervention in this regard.

During the discussion, it was decided to establish three separate lines for the public to worship the Sacred Tooth Relic during the special exposition. Additionally, I instructed officials to follow the guidance of the Mahanayake Theras regarding the safety of both the Sacred Tooth Relic and the public.

It was also suggested that during the period of the exposition, schools in the Kandy area should be closed, and that school sessions should be held on alternative days to accommodate children's education. Attention was also given to ensuring the health and safety of the devotees, managing waste, and making transportation arrangements during this time.

Moreover, extensive discussions were held on providing necessary facilities for the health, drinking water, and other needs of the public, as well as giving an opportunity for registered individuals to serve meals at the Dansalas for those coming to worship the Sacred Tooth Relic.

We also discussed the importance of organizing the event in a way that promotes Buddhist awareness among the public and of informing the public about the special exposition of the Sacred Tooth Relic.

The meeting was attended by the Maha Sangha, led by the Malwathu and Asgiri Anunayake Theras, the Minister of Buddhist Affairs, Religious and Cultural Affairs Dr. Hiniduma Sunil Senavi, the Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Land, and Irrigation K.D. Lal Kantha, the Governor of the Central Province Sarath Bandara Samarasinghe Abayakoon, Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela, District Secretary, Divisional Secretaries, heads of line institutions, and senior officials from the tri-forces and police."

Clarifying the timeline, he stated that court orders obtained by the Petroleum Dealers' Association in 2022 and 2023 prevented the government from implementing a CPC-approved tariff formula. However, the Court of Appeal revoked this order on August 30, 2024, and the ministry received it on September 2.

Wijesekara said the ministry promptly sought the Attorney General's opinion and instructed CPC to implement the order. However, the dealers appealed to the Supreme Court in mid-September, with the first hearing on September 18. He added that he was unaware of any Supreme Court ruling or further action taken after September 23.

He attached court documents and CPC board papers as evidence to support his claims.

One of the scientists involved in the study, Prof C Srinivasulu, told TNIE, ""The new species, Hipposideros srilankaensis, is distinguished by its unique morphological features, including a broad noseleaf, distinct ear shape, and cranial characteristics. Genetic analysis further confirmed its distinctiveness from other known species in the region.

The study also re-evaluated the taxonomic status of Hipposideros brachyotus, a species previously considered a subspecies of Hipposideros galeritus. The research confirmed that H brachyotus is a distinct species endemic to India, while the Sri Lankan population represents the newly described H srilankaensis.""

The study also revealed significant genetic divergence among populations of Hipposideros galeritus across Southeast Asia, suggesting the presence of cryptic species that warrant further investigation.

""The new species discovery and the taxonomic revision are the results of over a decade of meticulous research.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/02/western-allies-rally-around-ukrainian-president-after-trump-spat/,2025-03-02,Western allies rally around Ukrainian President after Trump spat,"Western leaders scrambled to back Ukraine after Friday's acrimonious meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky deepened the already yawning fault lines between Washington and many of its key allies.

The remarkable Oval Office exchange highlights a tricky balancing act facing Western capitals since Trump's return to office in January: maintaining steadfast support for Zelensky and Kyiv against Russian aggression, while not alienating a famously transactional president who appears increasingly sympathetic to President Valdimir Putin, tolerates little criticism and is upturning decades of transatlantic security alliances.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who met Trump in the White House on Thursday in one of the trickiest visits by a British leader to Washington in decades, spoke with both the US president and Zelensky following their shouting match, according to a Downing Street spokeswoman.

Starmer ""retains his unwavering support for Ukraine and is playing his part to find a path forward to a lasting peace, based on sovereignty and security for Ukraine,"" the spokeswoman said.

The UK is set to host a summit of European leaders on Sunday to discuss support for Kyiv. Zelensky is expected to attend what's likely to be a much more welcoming setting for the Ukrainian leader, with Starmer having urged Trump against accepting any peace deal in Ukraine that would ""reward"" Russia or its allies.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, a key Trump ally in Europe, also called for a summit with the US and European nations to discuss the war in Ukraine, saying that division makes the West weaker.

Europe's leaders and officials have been blindsided by a staggering collapse in American support for Ukraine in the past weeks, after almost three years of ironclad backing by the previous administration of Joe Biden. Many still cannot understand why US President Donald Trump has turned so furiously on Zelensky and conceded key concessions to Putin before even starting talks.

Zelensky has spoken to French President Emmanuel Macron and to European Council President António Costa following his scathing exchange with Trump at the White House, according to a Ukrainian source with knowledge of the situation.

""There is an aggressor, which is Russia, and an attacked people, which is Ukraine,"" Macron later said in a statement.

""Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians do,"" wrote German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on X. ""Therefore we are working on a common path to a lasting and just peace. Ukraine can rely on Germany - and on Europe.""

Kaja Kallas, the European Union's foreign policy chief, said in a statement that it's ""clear that the free world needs a new leader."" European Union leaders also issued a joint statement urging Zelensky to ""be strong.""

Zelensky has also spoken to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, a source said.

""Ukraine, you'll never walk alone,"" Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda said, while Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna cautioned that if ""Ukraine stops fighting, there will be no Ukraine.""

There was swift vocal support too from key US allies outside Europe, including from all other members of the so-called Five Eyes intelligence sharing network that are among Washington's most trusted partners.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country would ""continue to stand with Ukraine.""

""Russia illegally and unjustifiably invaded Ukraine. For three years now, Ukrainians have fought with courage and resilience. Their fight for democracy, freedom, and sovereignty is a fight that matters to us all,"" Trudeau wrote on X.

Australia's prime minister reiterated his country's support for Kyiv, saying it will ""continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.""

""We stand unequivocally with Ukraine in their struggle, because we regard that as a struggle for the upholding of international law,"" Anthony Albanese said.

Meanwhile New Zealand's leader Christopher Luxon said his nation remained ""steadfast in its support for Ukraine as it defends itself in a war that Russia started.""

'Ukraine, you'll never walk alone'

A notable exception to the wave of European solidarity was Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a far-right populist and Trump ally, who took to X to stand with the US president.

""Strong men make peace, weak men make war,"" Orban wrote. ""Today President (Trump) stood bravely for peace. Even if it was difficult for many to digest. Thank you, Mr. President!""

The tense exchange with Trump boosted Zelensky's backing among many at home, with Ukraine's lawmakers rallying behind Kyiv's leader.

""We are proud of our president. We are proud that he has guts to stand up for Ukraine,"" Oleksandr Merezhko, the head of the parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, told CNN's Jim Sciutto on Friday.

Merezhko said there's ""absolutely no doubt"" that the Ukrainian parliament will back Zelensky.

""We are united behind our president but at the same time, we hope that wisdom and common sense will prevail.""

Ukraine's military, who have spent more than three years holding back a far larger Russian force with the help of US and European aid, also maintained a message of defiance, at least on public channels.

""Trump understands the aggressive manner of negotiations and is trying to crush Zelensky,"" said Stanislav Buniatov, another Ukrainian military officer, in a Telegram post. ""There would have been no heated talks if Trump had offered at least a ceasefire on the contact line with minimal amendments.""

One military officer, who goes by the callsign Aleks, said on Telegram he doesn't ""give a damn"" about the kind of peace Trump offers.

""It's better to fight to death than to freeze the war and then be drained again in three years,"" he said. (CNN)"

During a COPE meeting held on February 27, chaired by MP (Dr.) Nishantha Samarawira, it was revealed that 683 underage workers were sent abroad for domestic work between May 2023 and June 2024.

Additionally, the failure to provide mandatory residential training for 28,165 first-time migrant domestic workers resulted in a loss of LKR 631,177,650 in training revenue for the SLBFE.

The committee also uncovered financial discrepancies, including the rental of 30 stalls for LKR 170,000 each for a program in Galle, while a single stall for a similar event in Jaffna was rented for LKR 500,000.

Further investigations revealed that 25 stalls had been purchased at a total cost of LKR 12.5 million.

Another key finding was that the SLBFE had granted approval for recruitment agencies to send domestic workers abroad on tourist visas.

The COPE committee criticized this as a complete failure in accountability. A circular issued on March 30, 2023 (07/2023) facilitated the migration of workers to the UAE and Oman without a formal labor agreement, raising concerns about their safety and legal status.

It was disclosed that 4,942 workers had left the country under tourist visas, with a significant number obtaining jobs, but their details had not been uploaded to the Sri Lankan embassy's database.

Meanwhile, the ""Jayagamu Sri Lanka"" program had incurred a total expenditure of LKR 1.2 billion, with officials defending the spending, stating that all payments had been made following proper procedures. However, since the expenditure exceeded LKR 500 million, cabinet approval was required, and the Auditor General's Department will now review the transactions.

The committee also discussed issues related to the temporary shelters maintained for stranded Sri Lankan migrant workers and the appointment procedures within the SLBFE.

Given the serious nature of the findings, COPE has decided to appoint a subcommittee to investigate the SLBFE further. (NewsWire)"

Mr. President,

Pursuant to the model conduct of a free, fair and peaceful election followed by a dignified transition in keeping with our decades of democratic practice, H.E. Anura Kumara Dissanayake was sworn in as the 9th Executive President of Sri Lanka in September last year, followed by the election of a new Parliament in November 2024, enabling the Government to move forward with a strengthened mandate to deliver on the people's expectations for a new political culture and economic and social development in Sri Lanka.

The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka, in his address to this Council last week, highlighted that Sri Lanka has embarked on a new path, with a government built through the collective will of the people from the North, East, West and South of the country. He highlighted the Government's commitment towards a unified Sri Lankan nation that respects diversity, and works towards removing all divisions based on race, religion, class and caste, and not allow a resurgence of racism or religious extremism in our country.

The Government has prioritized economic growth which will take place in a manner that is inclusive, where all citizens have enhanced economic opportunities allowing the resultant benefits to be reaped fairly by all strata of society. The rule of law, transparency, accountability and reconciliation will prevail in order to ensure sustained economic growth and social well-being of the people

The Government has committed to:

- protect democracy and human rights of all citizens including addressing past issues

- ensure the related domestic processes to be credible and independent within the Constitutional framework..

- And, to examine carefully and expand the work of the proposed truth and reconciliation commission, to investigate acts of violence caused by racism and religious extremism

Economic priorities of the Government include eradicating rural poverty, implementing the ""Clean Sri Lanka"" initiative to promote social, environmental, and ethical revival, and establishing a robust digital economy to foster innovation and sustainable growth. The Government is committed to ensuring assistance to all citizens affected by the conflict in consonance with its pledge to achieve sustainable peace, reconciliation and development in the conflict affected areas of the country.

Mr. President,

The work of the Office on Missing Persons (OMP), about which we have been updating this Council regularly, continues, with enhanced public trust and functional and financial independence. The OMP regional offices also receive complaints directly from the people. The OMP is collaborating with national, bilateral and international partners including the ICRC and UN agencies as well as local CSOs. Through a national level steering committee, the OMP is working with government agencies. It also has a separate national CSO forum which functions at national as well as district level under Government Agents.

The work of the Office for Reparations goes beyond monetary compensation to include livelihood and psychosocial support as collective reparation initiatives. The OR is a comprehensive reparations scheme anchored in the rights of all Sri Lankans and functions as an effective remedy to contribute to the promotion of reconciliation for the wellbeing, and security of all Sri Lankans.

Following its establishment as an independent institution by Parliamentary Act of January 2024, the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR), has been further strengthened. The ONUR conducts training programs to promote social cohesion, religious coexistence and conflict transformation workshops providing opportunities for interfaith and intercultural dialogue particularly among the youth. Reconciliation committees established at grass root level comprising clergy, women's groups, youth groups, government officials and civil society leaders are also involved in these activities. These committees have been established and are functioning in all grama niladhari divisions, which is the lowest level of local administration.

Mr. President,

We remain steadfast in our belief that national ownership with gradual reforms, is the only practical way forward to transformative change. We regret the continuing inconsistent application of human rights principles through the work of the Council. This has resulted in the erosion of trust in the human rights architecture making countries less likely to respect the noble purposes for which the Human Rights Council was created.

Sri Lanka has consistently spoken out against country specific resolutions that do not have the concurrence of the country concerned. We have reiterated our rejection of Resolutions 46/1, 51/1, and 57/1 and the external evidence gathering mechanism on Sri Lanka that has been set up using these divisive and intrusive resolutions.

The external evidence gathering mechanism on Sri Lanka within the OHCHR is an unprecedented and ad hoc expansion of the Council's mandate, and contradicts its founding principles of impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity. No sovereign state can accept the superimposition of an external mechanism that runs contrary to its Constitution and which pre-judges the commitment of its domestic legal processes.

Furthermore, serious concerns have been raised by a number of countries on the budgetary implications of this external mechanism, particularly at a time the UN is undergoing severe budgetary constraints.

As reaffirmed at previous sessions, the Government of Sri Lanka is determined to deal with human rights challenges including reconciliation through domestic processes. Sri Lanka will also continue its constructive engagement with the Human Rights Council and regular human rights instruments in a spirit of cooperation and constructive dialogue, as was done most recently when Sri Lanka actively and constructively engaged with the CEDAW committee for the review of our 9th periodic report.

Sri Lanka reiterates its commitment to multilateral cooperation in pursuit of peace, prosperity, and sustainability along with the promotion and protection of all human rights.

Thank you."

He further emphasized his awareness of the said issue and assured that stringent measures would be taken against such misconduct. He also mentioned that SLTB drivers and conductors had been duly informed of the matter.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/03/15-tax-on-dollar-earnings-key-misinterpretation-clarified/,2025-03-03,15% tax on Dollar earnings : Key misinterpretation clarified,"The new 15% tax on service exports applies to those earning profits by providing services abroad, Deputy Finance Minister Harshana Suriyapperuma said.

Addressing misinterpretations of the new regulation, the Deputy Minister clarified that salaries will not be directly taxed under this policy.

""For example, a YouTuber's business expenses are deducted from his income, and the capital allowance calculation is made by the Inland Revenue Department, and therefore only the profit will be taxed,"" he explained during an interview.

He also highlighted that Sri Lanka has signed double taxation treaties with over 40 countries, ensuring that taxes paid in those countries will not be taxed again in Sri Lanka.

""Our analyses have shown that most of these countries levy taxes far above Sri Lanka's 15%. Therefore, if taxes are deducted by those countries, we won't tax them any further,"" the Minister said.

The foreign exchange income from exported services will now be taxed, ending a longstanding exemption, the Sunday Times reported.

""The concessionary tax rate of up to 15% for individuals and a flat 15% for companies will come into effect on April 1, 2025, after being approved by Parliament,"" Nihal Wijewardana, Senior Deputy Commissioner of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD).

According to Wijewardana, export service income refers to income earned from services rendered or performed by an individual or company in Sri Lanka or abroad, provided the service is used outside of Sri Lanka.

Common examples of such services include back-office support, IT services, financial consulting, architecture, marketing, logistics, customer service, and accounting. Freelancers should note that income from multiple overseas clients is classified as business income, allowing them to deduct expenses, including capital allowances.

Taxation breakdown:

•⁠ ⁠Business profits exceeding Rs. 1.8 million annually will be taxed.
•⁠ ⁠The first Rs. 1 million is taxed at 6%, while the remainder is taxed up to 15%.
•⁠ ⁠Companies will be subject to a flat 15% tax.
•⁠ ⁠Local earners face a progressive tax of 6% to 36%.

Concerns were raised that migrant workers might be affected, but Mr. Wijewardana clarified that they are exempt. The Inland Revenue Act differentiates between residents and non-residents, meaning Sri Lankans working abroad are considered non-residents, and their remittances will not be taxed.

Under the new policy, previously unregistered individuals earning foreign income must now register for taxation. The IRD has strengthened tax enforcement, with interest and penalties applicable for non-compliance.""Anyone receiving an income locally and not paying taxes is committing a crime,"" Mr. Wijewardana emphasised.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/03/trump-signs-executive-order-making-english-the-official-u-s-language/,2025-03-03,Trump signs executive order making English the official U.S. language,"President Donald Trump on Saturday signed an executive order designating English as the official language of the U.S., the first time in American history such a designation has been made.

""From the founding of our Republic, English has been used as our national language,"" the order reads. ""It is therefore long past time that English is declared as the official language of the United States.""

Trump's order marks the first time in history the country has had an official language, though the majority of U.S. states have already designated English as their official language.

People who go through the naturalization process to become U.S. citizens are also required to take an English test in which they ""must demonstrate an understanding of the English language, including the ability to read, write, and speak basic English,"" according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Trump's order states that designating English as the country's official language will further ""empower"" new citizens and aid them in assimilating.

""Speaking English not only opens doors economically, but it helps newcomers engage in their communities, participate in national traditions, and give back to our society,"" the order states.

While English is the most widely used language in the country, U.S. residents communicate in more than 350 languages, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. More than three-quarters of Americans speak only English at home, according to the bureau.

The change is consistent with Trump's hard-line immigration stance, including his executive order ending birthright citizenship -- which several courts have struck down.

During the 2024 presidential campaign, he railed against undocumented immigrants that didn't speak English and warned about the languages that were ""coming into our country.""

Trump's own vice president has previously pushed for English to be the country's official language. In the last Congress, then-Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, introduced the English Language Unity Act with Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., which would have required the federal government to use English ""in commonsense circumstances.""

""This commonsense legislation recognizes an inherent truth: English is the language of this country. That is why the overwhelming majority of the American people support this proposal,"" Vance said in a statement when they unveiled the measure. ""The English language has been a cornerstone of American culture for over 250 years. It is far past time for Congress to codify its place into law, which is exactly what this bill does."" (NBC)"

As the post triggered widespread backlash, the party quickly intervened, asking her to delete it. The post was later taken down.

""Rohit Sharma is fat for a sportsman! Need to lose weight! And of course, the most unimpressive captain India has ever had!"" her now-deleted post read.

Her comments drew immediate backlash, particularly from BJP leaders and cricket fans. Responding to a user who called Sharma a ""world-class player,"" Mohamed dismissed the claim, questioning his legacy compared to Indian cricketing greats like Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli, and Kapil Dev.

""What is so world-class about him when compared to his predecessors? He is a mediocre captain as well as a mediocre player who got lucky to be the captain of India,"" she wrote.

The BJP swiftly condemned Mohamed's remarks, accusing Congress of ""body-shaming"" and disrespecting a World Cup winner. BJP leader Radhika Khera, who broke ties with the Congress and joined the BJP, accused her former party of having ""humiliated athletes for decades"".

""This is the same Congress that humiliated athletes for decades, denied them recognition, and now dares to mock a cricketing legend? The party that thrives on nepotism is lecturing a self-made champion?"" Khera said.

Radhika Khera criticised Rahul Gandhi, stating that while Rohit Sharma led India to a World Cup victory, the Congress leader struggled to manage his own party without leading it into turmoil. She also took a dig at Jairam Ramesh, urging him to focus on the Congress party's diminishing relevance, credibility, and electoral standing instead of targeting a cricketer who has brought glory to India.

""Congress should worry about its own sinking dynast before taking cheap shots at India's pride!"" she said.

Shama Mohamed defended her remark, stating that her tweet was a general observation about an athlete's fitness rather than an instance of body-shaming. ""It was not body-shaming. I always believed a sportsperson should be fit, and I felt he was a bit overweight, so I just tweeted about that,"" she said, pushing back against criticism.

Congress distanced itself from Shama Mohamed's remark, saying that the party ""holds the contributions of sporting icons in the highest regard"". Congress leader Pawan Khera said the party had asked Shama Mohamed to delete her post and ""advised her to exercise greater caution in the future"".

""The Indian National Congress holds the contributions of sporting icons in the highest regard and does not endorse any statements that undermine their legacy,"" Pawan Khera said.

Notably, India secured a commanding 44-run victory over New Zealand in their final group-stage clash of the 2025 Champions Trophy. Despite captain Rohit Sharma falling early, India posted a competitive total of 249 in their allotted 50 overs. The bowling attack, spearheaded by Varun Chakaravarthy, delivered a stellar performance, dismantling the Kiwi batting lineup and bundling them out for 205.

With their win, India marched into the semi-finals, where they will take on Australia in a high-stakes showdown on March 4. (India Today)"

""Prime Minister Netanyahu has decided that, as of this morning, all entry of goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will cease,"" Netanyahu's office said, accusing Hamas of refusing to accept the outline for continued talks set out by President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.

""Israel will not allow a ceasefire without the release of our hostages,"" the statement said. ""If Hamas continues its refusal, there will be further consequences.""

An Israeli source told ABC News that ""the Israeli decision to halt aid into Gaza was coordinated with the Trump administration.""

The White House said in a statement Sunday that it will ""support"" Israel's decision to block aid into Gaza, saying Hamas has indicated it's ""no longer interested in a negotiated ceasefire.""

""Israel has negotiated in good faith since the beginning of this administration to ensure the release of hostages held captive by Hamas terrorists. We will support their decision on next steps given Hamas has indicated it's no longer interested in a negotiated ceasefire,"" National Security Council Spokesman Brian Hughes said in the statement.

Witkoff's proposal was for a temporary extension of the ceasefire spanning the Ramadan and Passover holiday periods, ending on April 20. Under that proposal, Hamas would release half of all remaining living and deceased hostages on the first day and the rest when an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire.

The Israeli statement came after weekend negotiations regarding phase 2 of the ceasefire in Cairo, Egypt. Hamas was not directly involved in the talks and was represented by Qatari and Egyptian officials, who spoke with U.S. and Israeli delegations.

Hamas said in a Sunday statement that ""Netanyahu's decision to stop humanitarian aid is cheap blackmail, a war crime and a blatant coup against the agreement.""

""We reaffirm our commitment to implementing the signed agreement in its three stages and we have repeatedly announced our readiness to begin negotiations for the second stage of the agreement,"" the group added, calling on the U.S. ""to stop its bias and alignment"" with Israel.

""We call on the mediators to pressure the occupation to implement its obligations under the agreement, in all its stages, and to implement the humanitarian protocol, and to bring in shelters and rescue equipment to the Gaza Strip,"" Hamas added.

The statement said ""the only way"" to secure the return of Israeli hostages is to adhere to the ceasefire and ""immediately enter into negotiations to begin the second stage.""

Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said in a statement Sunday that they continue to speak to mediators ""to ensure the implementation of the remaining phases of the ceasefire agreement.""

The group said the government has failed to honor its pre-election promise, leaving elderly citizens struggling to cover basic living expenses, including healthcare costs.

Speakers at the event criticized the government's tax policies, saying they place a significant financial burden on ordinary citizens while large corporations have not faced similar tax increases. They also raised concerns over the government's decision to double the Withholding Tax on savings interest from 5% to 10%, arguing it has worsened economic hardships for retirees.

The group said the reduction in interest earnings has made it difficult for seniors to afford essential expenses such as food and medication  They urged the government to restore the 15% fixed deposit interest rate, which was in place before the economic crisis.

Despite requesting a meeting with the Ministry of Finance, the collective said they have not been granted an opportunity for dialogue.

The press conference, held at the Lions Club in Colombo, was attended by Dayapala Thiranagama, Melani Gunathilaka, Rachel Perera, Ananda Sisira Kumara, Janaki Senavirathna, and Attorney-at-Law Nuwan Bopage, who spoke on behalf of Sri Lanka's senior citizen community."

As quantum hardware becomes more affordable and widely available, criminals may exploit its advanced computational capabilities to break traditional encryption methods that protect data in many applications and services, posing a significant threat to current cybersecurity measures.

To address these challenges, governments and businesses need to adopt post-quantum cryptography soon. Developers must start learning about and testing quantum-safe algorithms, and enterprises need to audit their systems and migrate to quantum-resistant solutions.

While the rise of quantum computing presents immediate cybersecurity risks, it will ultimately lead to the evolution of a new form of cryptography designed to safeguard our digital world.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/04/operation-salmonslalom-kaspersky-discovered-a-new-attack-targeting-industrial-organizations-in-apac/,2025-03-04,Operation SalmonSlalom: Kaspersky discovered a new attack targeting industrial organizations in APAC,"Kaspersky ICS CERT discovered a campaign targeting industrial organizations in the Asia-Pacific region. The attackers used legitimate cloud services to manage malware and employed a complicated multi-stage malware delivery scheme using legitimate software to avoid detection. As a result, they could spread malware over victim organizations' networks, install remote administration tools, manipulate devices, steal and delete confidential information.

The campaign targeted government agencies and industrial organizations in several countries and territories in the APAC region, including Taiwan, Malaysia, China, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Zip archives with malware, disguised as tax-related documents, were delivered to victims in a phishing campaign via email and messengers (WeChat and Telegram). As a result of a complex multi-stage malware installation procedure, a backdoor, FatalRAT, was installed into the system.

While there were similarities to workflows observed in previous campaigns orchestrated by threat actors using open-source remote access Trojans (RATs) such as Gh0st RAT, SimayRAT, Zegost, and FatalRAT, this campaign demonstrated a notable shift in tactics, techniques, and procedures specifically tailored to Chinese-speaking targets.

The attack was carried out using legitimate Chinese cloud content delivery network (CDN) myqcloud and the Youdao Cloud Notes service. The attackers used a variety of methods to evade detection and blocking: dynamically changing control servers and malicious payloads, placing files on legitimate web resources, exploiting vulnerabilities in legitimate applications and using legitimate software capabilities to launch malware, packaging and encrypting files and network traffic.

Kaspersky called this attack campaign SalmonSlalom: the attackers challenged the cyberdefences like a salmon navigates the cascading water while travelling upstream, losing their strength in maneuvering between sharp rocks.

""We repeatedly see threat actors using combinations of relatively simple attack methods and techniques nevertheless succeed in reaching out their targets even within the OT perimeter. This particular campaign serves as a warning to various industrial organizations in the APAC region, alerting them to the threat actors who demonstrate an ability to gain remote access to operational technology systems. Being aware of such potential threats enables these organizations to bolster their security measures and proactively respond to protect their assets and data from malicious actors,"" comments Evgeny Goncharov, Head of Kaspersky ICS CERT.

Adrian Hia, the Managing Director for Kaspersky Asia Pacific said, ""The 'SalmonSlalom' attack demonstrates the increasing stealth and adaptability of threat actors. By leveraging legitimate cloud services and software for malicious payload delivery, they bypass traditional detection methods, posing greater challenges to industrial cybersecurity. This also reflects the evolving attack techniques targeting industrial organizations in the Asia-Pacific region, where attackers not only employ complex multi-stage infection chains but also tailor their tactics for specific targets. In the face of such threats, industrial organizations must enhance security awareness, improve threat detection capabilities, and strengthen cross-regional and cross-industry threat intelligence sharing to more effectively defend against these stealthy attacks.""

Though not attributable to any known group, the consistent use of Chinese-language services and interfaces, combined with other technical evidence, suggests the likely involvement of a Chinese-speaking threat actor.

We recommend taking the following measures to avoid falling victim to the attack described above:

Utilize EDR/XDR/MDR solutions for establishing a baseline regarding the most commonly observed grandparent-parent-child process relationship in OT environments. This highly recommended advice stems from our observation that a legitimate function of the legitimate binary was exploited to execute the subsequent staged payload.


* Enable two-factor authentication for logging in to administration consoles and web interfaces of security solutions.
* Install up-to-date versions of centrally managed security solutions on all systems and update antivirus databases and program modules on a regular basis.
* Check that all security solution components are enabled on all systems and that active policies prohibit disabling protection and terminating or removing solution components without entering the administrator password.
* Check that security solutions receive up-to-date threat information (for instance, from Kaspersky Security Network) for those groups of systems where the use of cloud security services is not prohibited by law or regulations.
* Update operating systems and applications to versions currently supported by the vendors. Install the latest security updates (patches) for operating systems and applications.
* Deploy a SIEM system, for example, Kaspersky Unified Monitoring and Analysis Platform."

Mark and Comm has reaffirmed its commitment to strengthening Sri Lanka's media landscape. On 20th February, its managing director, Thanzyl Thajudeen, met with the Hon. Minister of Health and Media, Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa, presenting a comprehensive report on the state of journalism in Sri Lanka and briefly discussing some key opportunities.

Director of the Global Operations Division of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Maarit Kohonen Sheriff providing an update on Resolution 57/1, Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka, urged the new government to uphold human rights and ensure new laws are developed transparently.

Full statement:

Following presidential and parliamentary elections late last year, the National People's Power coalition secured a large majority in parliament, signalling a decisive mandate from the Sri Lankan people to undertake transformative social, political and economic reforms.

Economic crises and austerity measures have impacted deeply on the poorest and most vulnerable in society. Creditors need to provide the government with the fiscal space necessary to realize all human rights.
In his inaugural address to parliament, President Kumara Dissanayake acknowledged the harms that have resulted from decades of ethnic divisions and racism. He pledged to address some longstanding human rights concerns, including by tackling corruption and ensuring accountability for the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks and other emblematic cases. These commitments to end impunity should extend to the large scale violations that occurred during the civil war and prior insurgencies.
These crimes must be thoroughly investigated, justice served victims and perpetrators held accountable. The new government has taken an initial step to appoint an expert panel to establish an independent prosecutor's office. We also urged the new government to reform and strengthen the office of missing persons, including by appointing independent and credible members to achieve meaningful progress in the thousands of cases of enforced disappearances.
The government is taking steps to amend problematic legislation, such as the oppressive Prevention of Terrorism Act and the Online Safety Act. All new laws must comply with Sri Lanka's international human rights obligations and be developed in a transparent, consultative and inclusive manner.

Our office continues to receive reports of surveillance and intimidation by security agents in the north and east, highlighting the need for more fundamental security sector reforms. We urge the new government to lift unnecessary regulation and restriction civil society and independent media to revive the civic space.

This is an important opportunity in Sri Lanka's history that must now translate into meaningful progress on accountability and human rights so heal societal divisions and break the cycle of impunity that has for so long racked Sri Lanka's past. Our office is ready to support Sri Lanka and hopes it can report tangible results to this council in September. (Newswire)"

Issuing an apology, MP Jayasekara stated that he unconditionally seeks forgiveness from anyone who was hurt by his remarks.

He also elaborated on his initial comments, explaining that he intended to highlight broader political and social issues rather than target any individual or community.

""A country is not built overnight. Politicians must take responsibility for the challenges faced by 22 million people in Sri Lanka. However, it is unfair to disregard the benefits and services that citizens continue to receive, such as free healthcare, education, and infrastructure, despite various challenges,"" he stated.

The MP further emphasized that social narratives should not be weaponized for political gain, stressing that legal measures should be taken against political misdeeds rather than allowing negative social attitudes to dictate justice.

""I regret that my words caused distress and overshadowed the real issue I aimed to highlight. My support and compassion for the disabled community remain unchanged,"" he added. (Newswire)"

He was remanded until 11 March 2025 after being produced before the Welisara Magistrate's Court. (Newswire)"

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/04/concerns-raised-over-appointment-of-retired-judges-to-public-private-sectors/,2025-03-04,Concerns raised over appointment of retired judges to public & private sectors,"The Lawyers' Collective has raised concerns over the government's decision to appoint retired judges, especially of the Superior Courts, to positions in both the public and private sectors.

Issuing a statement, the Lawyers' Collective said the appointment of retired judges, especially of the Superior Courts, to positions in both the public and private sectors has been a matter of concern to the legal community and the general public in Sri Lanka and elsewhere.

Post-retirement appointments of judges create a cloud over the sanctity of their judgements, irrespective of their merits. They also tend to undermine public faith in judicial independence. It is worse when an appointment is made immediately after retirement.

This is not to say that the valuable experience and insights acquired by judges should be wasted after retirement. The country must make good use of their knowledge in a manner that does not raise the suspicion that they were not impartial during their tenure, it said.

The Lawyers' Collective further said there can be no objection to retired judges being appointed as members or Chairpersons of constitutional commissions, Commissions of Inquiry or institutions such as the Law Commission of Sri Lanka, provided they are appointed through mechanisms such as the Constitutional Council, which ensures a national consensus on appointments. Their expertise could also be used in legal education and training of judges and lawyers.

The Lawyers Collective has proposed that retirement benefits for judges of the Superior Courts should be equivalent to the emoluments and benefits of judges in service.

They should not perform any function that would bring them monetary gain, advantage, or benefit except as permitted by the Constitution or written law. These matters should be regulated by constitutional or statutory provisions, it added.

The statement was signed by Rienzie Arsecularatne, President's Counsel, Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne, President's Counsel, Professor Savitri Goonesekere, Attorney-at-Law, M.A. Sumanthiran, President's Counsel, Geoffrey Alagaratnam, President's Counsel, Saliya Pieris, President's Counsel, S.T.

Representing the group, former minister Mervyn Silva told the media that funds had been obtained by non-profit organizations from USAID to change the cultural values of Sri Lanka and destroy the nation.

""US President Donald Trump himself is against the LGBTQIA+ community. The former Ranil Wickremesinghe Government may have allowed the introduction of the Bill. We informed the previous government not to allow the introduction of the Bill. We must protect our children,"" he said.

Mervyn Silva warned that if the government also approves the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill 2023, then not only the Fathers' Union but also the Mothers' Union and other groups will commence a protest starting from the Maha Sanga in Kandy.

In August 2022, Attorney at Law Premnath Dolawatte, a Member of Parliament representing the ruling party in Sri Lanka, handed over a private members bill to then President Ranil Wickremasinghe to amend the Penal Code provisions that criminalize consensual same-sex relations between adults.

Then President Ranil Wickremesinghe, subsequently announced that the government would not take action to block the Bill.

A revised version of the Bill was gazetted on 23 March 2023. The Bill was presented to Parliament on 4 April 2023. With the determination by the Supreme Court regarding the Bill's constitutionality, the Bill now requires a simple majority in Parliament to become law. (Newswire)"

The organization previously voiced its dissatisfaction in a press release issued on Feb. 20.

While the AMS stated it does not plan to engage in trade union action at this time, it acknowledged the justification for such measures by other doctor unions. The association warned of worsening internal and external brain drain due to long-unmet demands, leading to a shortage of medical specialists in the state sector and affecting healthcare services, particularly in rural areas.

Among its key concerns, the AMS highlighted the exclusion of medical specialists from the PA 22/99 circular on transport allowances, which is granted to other SL3-grade government officers. It said this has caused significant inconvenience for specialists who provide 24/7 medical services, often far from their residences.

The AMS also criticized the current voucher-based extra duty payment method, arguing that it fails to account for mandatory after-hours, off-site work. It proposed a fixed allowance to cover both on-site and off-site duties while updating the Disturbance and Availability components of the DAT allowance in line with the Sri Lanka Qualifications Framework (SLQF 12).

The association further emphasized the need for appropriate remuneration for non-clinical duties, including undergraduate and postgraduate teaching and participation in technical evaluation committees. It also called for the urgent introduction of a special Service Minute for medical professionals, similar to those established for the judiciary and the Attorney General's Department.

The AMS said it is in discussions with government authorities and awaiting a response. However, it warned that if talks fail, it would consider necessary actions to push for its demands.   (NewsWire)"

""The only fuel station in my family was started in 1955 by my grandfather. That fuel station has remained with my family over the last 70+ years. It is not illegal.

Refuting the claims, MP Rajakaruna said they were false and that he does not own a fuel station at present.

""My grandfather had owned a fuel station. This was even before I was born. However, we do not own a fuel station now. Our relatives have the right to do whatever business they want. Stop using our names and claiming political influence,"" he said.

""Reserves have increased significantly under the programme, they have reached about half of the programme objective already, which is very impressive,"" he said.

""Sticking with the reforms is really the best way out for Sri Lanka to assure its sustainability and it's important for everyone to recognise that. This is the last budget where there is still a bit of an increase needed, 1.5% of GDP. But all the hard adjustment had already taken place in the previous two years,"" Breuer said, noting of the importance of continuing with reforms to ensure long-term sustainability.

The IMF also expressed expectations regarding Sri Lanka's amended Economic Transformation Bill, particularly in maintaining commitments such as refraining from granting tax incentives.

Electricity tariffs and financial concerns

Addressing the reduction in electricity tariffs in January, Breuer warned that the adjustment has moved away from cost-reflective pricing, which could lead to financial losses for the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).

""This is when we felt that the cost-reflective pricing was no longer met. On a forward-looking basis, that tariff cut meant that the CEB wouldn't be able to avoid any losses. These cuts implied that losses would be run. This is a concern we have, it could start building up again that could ultimately become a contingent liability for the government. Avoiding this,"" he stressed, ""was an important part of the program.""

Vehicle imports and foreign reserves

The IMF also weighed in on Sri Lanka's decision to lift import restrictions on vehicles, cautioning about its potential impact on the country's balance of payments.

""There is a question as to what extent the central bank should intervene to make those reserves available, versus allowing the exchange rate to fluctuate in response to market forces. That is something which remains to be seen,"" Breuer said.

Sri Lanka's economic trajectory

Looking ahead, the IMF official expressed confidence in Sri Lanka's economic recovery, noting that the country has regained 40% of the income lost over the past five years.

""In a short amount of time, you have significant recovery, you have the most recent growth number of 5.5%. Things are turning around significantly in Sri Lanka. As economic opportunities return to Sri Lanka, incomes will increase and poverty reduced. And also it will be more attractive to remain in Sri Lanka, not leave and emigrate,"" Breuer opined.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/04/fintech-regulation-that-supports-innovation-a-balancing-act/,2025-03-04,Fintech Regulation That Supports Innovation: A Balancing Act,"Dr. Ranee Jayamaha, a distinguished expert in Monetary Economics and a Payment Systems Specialist with over 50 years of experience in the banking and financial services sector, serves on the board of the newly formed Fintech Forum.  She offers the following insights into the evolving regulatory requirements of the financial landscape.

The rise of Fintech companies and their innovative products has undeniably transformed the financial landscape, offering speed, efficiency, and accessibility that strongly appeal to a new generation of consumers, particularly Generation Z. Their demand positions Fintech as the primary driver of the future of financial services. Fintech is widely used across the sector to generate efficiencies, lower costs, improve online services and digitisation, and assist regulatory authorities, therefore they impact both advanced and developing financial markets. While traditional banks have often been slow to embrace innovation and digitisation, exceptions exist.  The Development Bank of Singapore (DBS), for example, has established a Digibank (a Fintech-type neobank) in India, offering personal accounts, including debit cards, with all transactions managed from an iPhone or Android application.

The Scope and Regulatory Landscape of Fintech

Dr JayamaFintech encompasses a broad range of disciplines. Most Fintech companies enhance access to existing financial services through technological innovation, while others introduce entirely new services powered by technology. In Sri Lanka, Fintech companies that do not provide traditional banking services, such as issuing loans, are not regulated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). They are either unregulated or may fall under different regulatory frameworks depending on their specific services.

In some jurisdictions, Fintech is driven by startups, while in others, large technology conglomerates and established financial institutions (FIs), primarily banks, deploy Fintech solutions. Regulatory responses should identify and address the risks associated with  Fintech while tailoring the approach to the nature of innovation and its impact on financial services. Overly stringent regulation can stifle Fintech initiatives, potentially depriving consumers of low-cost, convenient, and efficient financial services.

Striking the Right Regulatory Balance

Regulators and policymakers must proactively assess the adequacy of current regulatory frameworks to harness Fintech's benefits while mitigating risks to financial stability. While Fintech remains relatively small compared to regulated FIs in Sri Lanka,  it is growing rapidly, particularly in riskier business segments. Although Fintech has the potential to improve financial inclusion, it also presents increased risk-taking,  cybersecurity risks, market volatility,  and contagion effects among consumers and FIs, potentially undermining financial stability.

Lending activity facilitated by Fintech platforms may involve higher financial risks due to concentration and over-reliance on data-driven algorithms. In Sri Lanka, many borrowers have reported that while Fintech loan processing is much faster than traditional banks, the interest rates are high, and repayment enforcement methods are aggressive. Because these loans are granted online with minimal barriers, regulatory authorities face challenges in controlling them. Additionally, new financial technologies with complex network structures--particularly in lending--have yet to be assessed during economic downturns.

On the positive side,  Fintech can contribute to financial stability by enhancing decentralisation, diversifying risk, deepening financial markets, and improving efficiency and transparency in service delivery. The ability of Fintech to facilitate capital raising helps diversify risk in financial systems, as demonstrated in advanced economies.

Systemic Financial Risks and the Need for Strong Oversight

Even in its infancy, Fintech can significantly impact financial stability. With rapid growth, its influence will only expand, necessitating crucial policy interventions, especially as large FIs and big-tech companies increasingly adopt Fintech solutions. Fintech firms often assume higher risks, which in turn pressurise traditional FIs to engage in riskier operations and transactions.

Recent developments indicate that systemic financial risks can emerge from institutions that individually may not appear systemically significant. Maintaining financial stability requires robust regulatory institutions, better technological oversight, extensive cross-border coordination, and prudential regulations that ensure a level playing field. Effective monitoring and supervision of both traditional and emerging FIs is essential.

A technology-neutral regulatory approach may be suitable when Fintech is used to enhance the efficiency of existing banking products. However, when Fintech introduces heavily tech-based innovations that significantly differ from traditional financial services, bespoke regulations may be required.

The Risks of Unregulated Fintech

Dr Jayamaha, a distinguished Economist and Payment Systems Specialist with over 50 years of experience in banking and financial services, emphasises the importance of effective but light-touch regulation. ""If Fintech is left  unregulated,"" she warns, ""the entire financial system could be at risk.""

The core issue with unregulated Fintech is its inherent risks as the rapid pace of innovation and transaction processing introduces vulnerabilities. Even when transactions pass through licensed banks, these institutions may struggle to monitor activities effectively.

Dr Jayamaha highlights several potential risks:

Fintech's interconnectedness with larger FIs creates channels for risk transmission. Many banks integrate fintech solutions into their operations, while some Fintech companies operate as subsidiaries or associates of banks. This relationship can expose traditional FIs to vulnerabilities if their Fintech partners engage in illegal financial activities. Additionally, cloud-based networks connecting Fintech and traditional institutions could introduce cybersecurity risks to either or both parties.

International Regulatory Best Practice and The Path to Regulation

Key regulatory concerns include:

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) oversees the UK's financial markets, ensuring consumer protection, market integrity, and competition. The UK's regulatory sandbox approach has been adopted by other countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Jordan. Sri Lanka launched its Fintech regulatory sandbox in February 2020, and CBSL issued applicable regulations to Fintech.

To align Sri Lanka's Fintech regulations with international standards, CBSL may consider adopting  a two-pronged regulatory approach:

The Fintech Forum, established in 2024, has been instrumental in fostering interaction between regulators,  FIs, and Fintech companies as well as setting out guiding principles for Fintech operations. The new Government has already embarked on a systematic approach to digitisation and in this background, the Forum can assist in formulating a sustainable Fintech ecosystem that would collaborate with all stakeholders and regional Forums.

Balancing Fintech innovation with financial stability requires a pragmatic regulatory approach and effective supervision. While excessive regulation can stifle progress, lax oversight can create systemic risks. The sandbox approach, combined with flexible but effective regulations, offers a viable path forward. As Dr Jayamaha  asserts, ""Markets and Fintech service providers cannot afford to wait until all regulations are finalised before becoming regulated and supervised."" The goal should be to leverage Fintech's transformative potential while ensuring a safe and stable financial future.


* Data Security - Strong consumer data protection measures are essential to mitigate financial risks.
* Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Compliance - Governments are keen to prevent Fintech from being exploited for illicit financial activities.
* Cybersecurity - Fintech companies are prime targets for cybercriminals, necessitating robust security frameworks.
* Live Testing Environments and Potential Disruptions- Allowing Fintech innovations to operate in controlled environments before full-scale deployment can mitigate risks.

1. Market Disruptions - Unregulated Fintech can undermine established market practices, creating unfair competition for regulated institutions. In Sri Lanka, licensed banks and finance companies account for two-thirds of total financial assets, operating under stringent CBSL supervision. The unchecked rise of Fintech could disrupt this balance and orderly conduct of markets.
2. Foreign Exchange Concerns - Unregulated Fintech can facilitate untraceable cross-border transactions, impacting a country's foreign exchange position. Even when transactions flow through banks, monitoring remains a challenge. When they begin to deal with invisible crypto assets, cross-border regulations will have to be tightened.
3. Jurisdictional Differences - The global nature of Fintech complicates regulation, allowing Fintech companies to facilitate money laundering and terrorist financing by exploiting regulatory loopholes in different jurisdictions.
4. Fintech Expansion Outpacing Manual Regulatory Systems: Risks are not confined to the unregulated sector. Manual regulatory mechanisms often struggle to keep pace with technological advancements. The rapid expansion of Fintech can undermine existing supervisory systems, which are traditionally built on less digitised foundations.

1. Technology-Neutral Approach - When Fintech enhances existing banking services, leveraging existing regulatory frameworks , then the existing regulatory mechanism should be sufficient.
2. Sandbox Approach - For entirely new Fintech innovations, a controlled live testing environment ensures compliance before market release. A well-functioning regulatory sandbox can foster Fintech innovation without disrupting financial stability objectives. In 2020 CBSL issued the ""Financial Technology Regulation Sandbox Framework"" for Fintech who were keen to test their products in a live environment. However, none of the applicants qualified for the CBSL entry requirements, and stated that the criteria were too stringent. To maximise Fintech's benefits while addressing regulatory challenges, CBSL needs to engage in continuous dialogue with the Fintech industry and revisit the sandbox entry requirements in consultation with Fintech operators."

MP Sajith Premadasa raised concerns regarding the Online Safety Act and the 15% IT tax while raising questions under Standing Order 27(2) in Parliament today.

Online Safety Act

The Opposition Leader stated that amending the Online Safety Act, passed in a manner that restricts freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Sri Lanka's Constitution, was a key campaign promise of the current government.

He further noted that while the country's economic development program emphasizes the adoption of advanced digital technology and innovation, the proposed measures seem unlikely to achieve their fundamental objectives.

He questioned the government on when the Online Safety Act would be amended, highlighting that he had opposed it while in the opposition.

MP Premadasa asked whether the act would be rendered invalid until it was amended and what steps had been taken in this regard.

Additionally, he inquired about the number of suspects arrested and imprisoned under the act, emphasizing that political victimization had occurred both in the past and continues today under this legislation.

Impact of the 15% IT Tax

Addressing the proposed 15% tax on foreign exchange earnings from the IT sector under the Income Tax (Amendment) Act, the Opposition Leader asked how many individuals in the service export sector would be affected.

He also inquired about the annual tax revenue expected from this measure, pointing out that even the Minister of Industries had voiced opposition to the tax.

Furthermore, he urged the government to present its plan for segregating and tracking this tax revenue from foreign remittances.

MP Premadasa also called for an analysis of the broader impact this tax would have on the digital economy and potential alternative money laundering mechanisms. (Newswire)"

He also rebuffed renewed accusations that his own administration failed to credibly investigate alleged government links to deadly terrorist attacks that rocked Sri Lanka in 2019.

Wickremesinghe, who was voted out of office in 2024, threatened to leave 8 minutes into the hour-long interview with Mehdi Hasan, but ultimately remained seated for a heated debate that also covered the government's handling of war crimes investigations following the country's civil war, and allegations of torture committed under his watch in the late 1980s.

""In my country, it's the attorney general, who is not a political figure, who decides on prosecution - We can only send the evidence before him,"" Wickremesinghe said when asked if he'd covered for ex-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who fled the country in 2022 following mass protests.

Both Gotabaya and his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa, a former Prime Minister and President, have been widely accused of corruption and war crimes and driving the country into a major financial crisis.

On letting Gotabaya Rajapaksa back into the country without arrest after Wickremesinghe took over the presidency in 2022, the latter said: ""He could come [back] in. There's no charge against him. How could I? Am I a dictator?""

Hasan also pressed Wickremesinghe on renewed accusations by the Catholic Church that his own government had protected ""other forces"" involved in the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings carried out by an ISIS-affiliate.

In response, Wickremesinghe called the allegations ""all nonsense"" and an example of ""the politics of the Catholic Church.""

""The head of the Catholic Church [in Sri Lanka] is talking nonsense?"" Hasan clarified. ""Yes,""Wickremesinghe said.

Wickremesinghe, who was Prime Minister in 2019, was responding to public statements by local Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, as well as exclusive comments the Cardinal had made to Al Jazeera's Head to Head team before the TV recording. In a phone call with Al Jazeera, Ranjith said Wickremesinghe had failed to heed the Church's request for a truly independent investigation and called an earlier inquiry and report during Wickremesinghe's presidency ""not worth the paper it was written on"".

Turning to truth and reconciliation for Sri Lanka's civil war with the LTTE (also known as the Tamil Tigers), Hasan asked if justice had been served to the thousands of victims of the conflict that ended in 2009. Wickremesinghe conceded: ""No. Justice has not been served to any of the communities.""

He accepted that aid had been blocked to war victims and some hospitals had been bombed but denied that such bombings were systematic.

""There had been occasions where the Air Force had bombed [hospitals] and action was taken against some of them. But on a large-scale, this thing? I wouldn't say that.""

""According to a U.N. panel [...], Sri Lankan government forces blocked the delivery of aid to victims of the war,"" Hasan prompted.

""I admit that took place,"" Wickremesinghe conceded, who was the opposition leader at the time of the final phase of the war.

Pressed on why, as President, he reappointed General Shavendra Silva - whom the US State Department accuses of war crimes - to head Sri Lanka's armed forces, Wickremesinghe said, ""It's a practice not to replace military commanders during [an] election."" He added, ""When I took over, I checked on it and I was satisfied that General Silva was not involved in it.""

Wickremesinghe went on to deny allegations made by a government commission that he knew of illegal detention, torture and killings happening at Batalanda, a housing complex he was living in as a minister in the late 1980s.

""I deny all those allegations,"" he said when confronted with a government inquiry that named him as a ""main architect"" of securing the housing complex and alleged he, ""to say the least, knew"" about the violations taking place there.

Wickremesinghe first denied the existence of the report, of which Al Jazeera had obtained a copy, and later questioned its validity, saying it had never been discussed in parliament. ""That was not tabled in Parliament and there is nothing to be found against me.""

Wickremesinghe, who was appointed president by parliament in 2022 amidst one of the biggest political and financial crises in Sri Lankan history, defended his own presidency and 2024 election loss:

""In two years, I put the economy back on track. And that means disinflation, compression. It's very, very difficult. Will you survive that? No, I can't see that,"" he said about last year's election in which he finished third.

""I'm quite happy. I did the job,"" he said, referring, in part, to a landmark IMF deal he brokered as president. ""There would have been a political and economic collapse of the country"" (if he hadn't taken over the Presidency).

Hasan and Wickremesinghe were joined by a panel of experts:

Former BBC Sri Lanka correspondent and author of 'Counting the Dead', Frances Harrison; Former UK MP and envoy to Mr Wickremesinghe during his presidency, Nirj Deva; and Madura Rasaratnam, Executive Director of human rights organization PEARL and Senior Lecturer in Comparative Politics at City, University of London.

Over the past few years, the company has ramped up both its manufacturing and sales operations in the country, signalling its commitment to making India a key part of its global strategy.

From increasing local production to opening flagship stores, Apple's expansion in India underscores the country's growing importance as a manufacturing hub and a lucrative consumer market.

Factors behind Apple's big bet on India

One of the most significant factors behind Apple's growing interest in India is the need to reduce its dependency on China for manufacturing.

For years, Apple has relied heavily on Chinese factories, particularly those operated by Foxconn, Pegatron, and Wistron.

However, increasing geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, coupled with strict COVID-19 lockdowns and supply chain disruptions, have made diversification a necessity.

India presents an attractive alternative. The country offers a stable political environment, a rapidly improving infrastructure, and a massive workforce that can support Apple's manufacturing needs.

By shifting some of its production to India, Apple can mitigate risks associated with over-reliance on a single country and ensure business continuity.

The Indian government has been actively wooing global tech giants to establish manufacturing bases in the country through its ""Make in India"" and ""Production-Linked Incentive (PLI)"" schemes.

Apple has been a major beneficiary of these policies, receiving incentives for producing iPhones locally.

Under the PLI scheme, manufacturers receive financial benefits based on the scale of production, which makes India a cost-effective location for Apple.

Additionally, the Indian government has eased regulations on foreign direct investment (FDI), allowing Apple to establish its own retail stores without the need for a local partner.

This has played a crucial role in Apple's expansion strategy in the country.

While Apple has traditionally struggled in India due to the price-sensitive nature of the market, things are changing.

India's middle class is expanding, and with increasing disposable income, more consumers are willing to invest in premium products like iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks.

Moreover, India's smartphone market is the second largest in the world after China, with millions of new users entering the ecosystem each year.

Apple's recent decision to manufacture newer iPhone models in India closer to their global release dates suggests that it sees strong growth potential in Indian sales.

By producing devices locally, Apple can also avoid import duties, making its products more competitively priced.

Apple's manufacturing partners, including Foxconn and Pegatron, have significantly increased their production capabilities in India.

Foxconn, in particular, has invested heavily in new factories, expanding its production of iPhones and other Apple devices.

Apple's contract manufacturers are now assembling some of the latest iPhone models in India, a move that highlights the country's growing role in the company's global supply chain.

Beyond serving the Indian market, Apple is also looking at India as an export hub.

The company has already started exporting Made-in-India iPhones to Europe and other regions, reducing reliance on Chinese factories for global supply. This aligns with India's goal of becoming a major electronics manufacturing exporter.

For years, Apple relied on third-party resellers and online marketplaces like Amazon and Flipkart to sell its products in India.

However, in 2023, Apple made a significant move by opening its first two official retail stores in Mumbai and Delhi.

These flagship stores not only enhance Apple's brand presence but also offer an immersive customer experience, something that has been a key driver of Apple's global success.

Direct retail stores also help Apple strengthen its pricing strategy, offer better customer service, and create a stronger ecosystem of Apple products in India.

More retail stores are expected in the coming years, further solidifying Apple's presence in the country.

Apple's expansion in India is not just benefiting the company but also contributing significantly to job creation and economic growth.

The company's local manufacturing efforts have created thousands of jobs, directly and indirectly, in factories and retail operations.

Foxconn alone has announced plans to hire tens of thousands of workers for its Indian facilities.

Additionally, Apple's investment in India is expected to drive innovation and boost the country's electronics manufacturing sector.

More local suppliers are likely to join Apple's supply chain, leading to further industrial growth and technological advancements.

Apple is not the only tech company looking at India for expansion.

Rivals like South Korea's Samsung and China's Xiaomi have already established strong manufacturing bases in the country.

By strengthening its local manufacturing and sales presence, Apple is ensuring that it remains competitive in one of the fastest-growing smartphone markets in the world.

Samsung, for example, already produces a significant portion of its smartphones in India and has a vast retail network.

To compete effectively, Apple needs to ramp up both its production capabilities and retail outreach, which explains its aggressive expansion strategy.

Apple's push in India is not just about short-term gains; it's part of a broader long-term vision.

As China's labour costs rise and geopolitical risks persist, India is emerging as a viable alternative for large-scale manufacturing.

Apple's ongoing investments indicate that it sees India as a long-term strategic manufacturing and consumer hub.

Furthermore, India's digital transformation and increasing internet penetration make it a key market for Apple's ecosystem of products and services.

From iCloud to Apple Pay, there is enormous potential for growth beyond just hardware sales.

Apple's aggressive expansion in India is a well-calculated move driven by the need to diversify its manufacturing, tap into a growing consumer market, and leverage government incentives.

As the company continues to invest in local production, retail expansion, and exports, India is poised to play a pivotal role in Apple's global strategy.

With the Indian government's continued support for electronics manufacturing and Apple's commitment to increasing its presence, the partnership between Apple and India is set to strengthen further.

Whether in terms of manufacturing prowess, economic impact, or consumer demand, Apple's big bet on India is likely to pay off in the coming years. (Times Kuwait)"

Aqua Bridge Group, whose chairman is Sheikh Ahmed bin Mana bin Khalifa Al-Maktoum, said the partnership project in the Uttar Pradesh town of Unnao includes the development of a 1 million tonne aquafeed plant to supply India's growing aquaculture sector.

Sheikh Al-Maktoum also has his own family investment office called AMKM Investments, which invests in technology, food and beverage and real estate, according to its website.

""This transformational project is set to redefine sustainable fisheries and food security in India, addressing local market gaps while driving large scale aquaculture development,"" Mohammad Tabish, founder and CEO of Aqua Bridge, said in a LinkedIn post.

Aquaculture is the science of cultivating marine or freshwater food fish, such as salmon or trout, under controlled conditions.

The India project, which includes a 300 million fish fry hatchery, is in partnership with the World Bank's Uttar Pradesh Agriculture Growth and Rural Enterprise Ecosystem Strengthening (UP-Agrees) programme and the region's government, the company said. It will provide training for 100,000 farmers.

The UP-Agrees programme is a $325 million initiative aimed at enhancing farmers' incomes in Uttar Pradesh, focusing on improving crop productivity, promoting digital and climate-resilient agricultural practices and strengthening market connections.

The research and development part of the project is dedicated to advancing genetics, disease management and optimised farming techniques.

Aqua Bridge is in the process of completing the acquisition of Greek bass and bream producer Avramar, the largest aquaculture producer in the Mediterranean. (AGBI)"

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/05/workers-stressed-confused-as-china-cuts-finance-salaries-but-raises-public-sector-pay/,2025-03-05,"Workers stressed, confused as China cuts finance salaries but raises public sector pay","As a single mother raising a teenage boy in southern China, a 1,500 yuan ($330) monthly wage cut has hit Ms Wei hard.

""I could save 1,000 yuan every month in the past, but now I have to use my savings to pay [part of] my mortgage,"" said Ms Wei, who didn't want to use her full name for privacy reasons.

Ms Wei said she only has enough savings to supplement her mortgage payments for the next two to three months.

As an accountant in China, Ms Wei works in the finance sector where the government has been cutting and capping workers' pay.

China's financial sector is led by state-owned banks and institutions, which are ultimately controlled by the government.

Ms Wei's monthly salary has been reduced from 6,000 yuan to 4,500 yuan and her year-end bonus slashed by more than half.

""They [the government] started to cut everyone's salary last July. It's a heavy blow to my life,"" Ms Wei said.

While her wage started shrinking six months ago, late in January Chinese authorities announced a new round of finance sector pay cuts to ""reduce costs and increase efficiency"".

On Chinese social media, there have also been complaints of pay cuts from people working for government-related employers in the construction, engineering, and media sectors.

But with no announcements from authorities about salary reductions in those industries, the scale of the impact remains unclear.

At the same time, China's government has increased the wages of public service workers.

Experts say one of main reasons the government is controlling people's incomes in different industries is to reduce inequality in Chinese society.

'I can barely make a living'

In the new round of finance sector wage reductions announced in January, Chinese authorities said no employee working in a state-owned financial institution could be paid more than a total annual package of 973,000 yuan.

The annual average income for finance sector workers is higher than other industries -- finance wages are reportedly 2.35 times that of wages in China's manufacturing industry.

""Overall, Chinese companies haven't been doing well recently, but people in the finance industry still enjoy a relatively high income,"" explained Shi He-Ling, a Monash University economics professor.

Professor Shi said the government was trying to intervene and redistribute the income to public service workers and it was unlikely people's individual circumstances would be considered before a salary was slashed.

That appeared to be the case for Gaia Wang, who, when she found out her salary would be cut by 1,500 yuan a month, called her mum crying.

""I can barely make a living,"" said Ms Wang, who lives in south-west China.

Ms Wang works for an investment firm in the finance sector.

Her monthly salary was 6,500 yuan but dropped to 5,000 yuan in February.

While she is still coming to terms with how the salary reduction will impact her life, her mental health has deteriorated and she's unsure how she'll continue to afford living costs.

""The salary was comparatively low [to other finance sector workers] but I'm early in my career and used to find it OK living in Chengdu,"" she explained.

Pay rise for public service

The painful news of her pay cut compounded after a surprise revelation during the phone call with her mum.

Ms Wang says she doesn't know exactly why her mum, who is a public servant, got a pay rise.

China raised government workers' salaries across the country for the first time in years in January by at least 500 yuan a month.

Chinese authorities didn't publicly acknowledged the pay rise, nor did they say explain why they made the decision.

While some media reported the hike was intended to boost domestic consumption, Professor Shi suggested there could be multiple motives.

""There could be both economic and political reasons,"" he said.

He pointed out that most public servants were property owners and the government wanted to keep them happy.

China's property prices have dropped about 30 per cent since they peaked in 2021.

Falling property prices were likely leading to shrinking wealth among government workers, Professor Shi said.

""They [government workers] lay the foundation for the government's management. China relies on them for keeping their governance stable.""

Professor Shi said he believed the wage policies would have unintended impacts, like forcing talented workers to take up other jobs.

In 2024 alone, more than 10,000 people left the securities industry, according to local media.

Ms Wang is among those considering quitting the finance sector.

While she works at the investment firm, she is studying law and preparing to sit the bar exams.

""I used to make one-year plans, three-year plans and five-year job plans, but now I'm just investing more time on myself,"" Ms Wang said.

For Ms Wei, the challenges of raising a school-aged son meant she desperately wanted to spend more time with her family.

But with so many people leaving the finance sector, the prospect of finding a new job concerns Ms Wei.

""What I'm worried about is that if I quit, I could end up with a worse job,"" she said.

""The economy is so bad and the competition [for work] is brutal."" (ABC)"

According to District Emergency Officer Rescue 1122 Naveed Iqbal, on Feb 15, 2025, the emergency service received a call about a newborn lying in the garbage near Adda Stop, Duska.

Responding to the call, a rescue team rushed to the scene and found the newborn, a girl, had already died. The matter was reported to local police, he said.

Similarly, he said, the bodies of four other newborns, all of them girls, were found in Kharta Sayedan, Pasrur Road, Dalwali and Bhaer Pulley.

Mr Iqbal said the information regarding the discovery of these bodies was provided to the police concerned by the Rescue 1122 staff.

Sialkot District Police Officer (DPO) Faisal Shahzad told Dawn that two of the bodies were found in the limits of Saddar police station and three in the Cantonment police station precincts. He said the police registered murder FIRs against the unidentified persons who threw the newborns in the garbage.

The DPO said City Circle Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Tariq Mehmood and Saddar Circle DSP Noman have been assigned the task to probe the matter and nab the culprits.

He said the police investigation teams have started working on these cases, hoping the culprits would soon be traced through human intelligence and modern gadgets like CCTV camera footage.

Sialkot Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Zulqarnain Langarial expressed concern over these incidents and said the health chief executive officer had been directed to check private hospitals and maternity homes to find a clue to the parents of the deceased newborns.

He said that preventing such incidents would not be possible without the cooperation of civil society.

Locals have demanded that Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz take notice of these incidents. (Dawn)"

It coincides with a larger effort by the Indian government to make the country into a world-class shipbuilder.

A delegation from the South Korean shipbuilder was reported by The Times of India to be touring the country's facilities and talking with different domestic shipbuilders. The newspaper links the Koreans to L&T among other companies for a possible partnership. In addition, it reports that the South Koreans are spurring competition among the Indian states to attract the possible investments as it assesses potential sites for a shipbuilding facility.

According to the newspaper, the visit by the delegation from Hyundai was in response to a visit by the Indians to South Korea in December. The paper reports India's Ports and Shipping Ministry secretary T.K. Ramachandran led a delegation to meet with the three largest South Korean shipbuilders. They expressed the government's interest in collaboration opportunities.

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has declared plans to establish India on the international stage for shipbuilding. The government has said it will be a critical industry for the future while also citing the benefits of reducing international expenses while boosting foreign trade and increasing earnings from the international economies. India, the government declared, will rank among the top 10 shipbuilders by 2030 and the top five by 2047.

HD Hyundai which is the largest in South Korea continues to face strong competition from the Chinese shipbuilders. The South Koreans reported strong profitability in 2024 despite rising costs and capacity limits which see order slots full till at least 2026 or beyond. Hyundai attempted foreign partnerships in the past, including in the Philippines, without success.

The company is mapping its long-term strategy focusing on automation and green technology orders. For its shipyard, it looks to dramatically increase productivity. The company in 2021 launched its plan for the shipyard of the future and cites its use of the latest technologies including AI and digital twins as it seeks to increase productivity and safety.

This week its partner in the shipyard of the future, Palantir Technologies released a video in South Korea highlighting the efforts to create an automated shipyard. Hyundai is quoted as saying it will increase productivity by 30 percent in shipbuilding while also cutting production time for new ships by 30 percent. The goal is to complete the Future of Shipyard project by 2030.

According to the credit rating company, the bed addition in just these two fiscals, will equal those added between fiscals 2020 and 2024.

A Crisil Ratings analysis of 91 private hospitals, with a combined revenue of about ₹64,000 crore last fiscal, indicates as much, the report added.

It further adds that for the record, private hospitals account for 63 per cent of the sectoral revenue in India.

Over fiscals 2020-2024, private hospitals clocked a compound annual growth rate of 18 per cent in revenue and healthy operating profitability of 18 per cent, ensuring strong cash flow, as per the insights-driven analytics company.

Their strong performance and the relatively low bed capacity per person in India vis-a-vis developed and developing nations have spurred substantial investments through private equity and initial public offerings (IPOs), Crisil Ratings said, adding that this has strengthened balance sheets and enabled hospitals to pursue ambitious bed additions without materially impacting their credit profiles.

Anuj Sethi, Senior Director, Crisil Ratings, ""With occupancy close to the peak of 65-70 per cent and continued demand for quality healthcare, private hospitals are investing ~Rs 25,000 crore this fiscal and the next, nearly 80 per cent higher than the average annual investment in the previous four fiscals. Three-fourths of the capex will be funded through internal accruals. Plus, healthy return metrics have attracted a substantial investment of ₹55,000-60,000 crore from private equity and equity markets since fiscal 2022.""

According to the report, half of the new beds will come from greenfield expansions, highlighting significant investment in new healthcare infrastructure. About 40 per cent will comprise brownfield development, focusing on modernizing and optimizing existing facilities. The remaining 10 per cent will result from large players taking over under-construction hospitals and small and mid-sized hospitals, reinforcing organic growth efforts.

Naren Kartic K, Associate Director, Crisil Ratings, ""The large proportion of greenfield expansion poses risks related to timely completion and ramp-up in occupancies. However, given that ~70 per cent of these projects are in metropolitan/Tier 1 cities, where hospitals reach optimal occupancy and breakeven in 12-15 months, the pressure on profitability and associated return metrics is likely to be limited. Moreover, recent equity raises have strengthened balance sheets, allowing for the absorption of capex debt without materially impacting debt protection metrics.""

As per the report, the interest coverage ratio and total debt to EBITDA, both key debt protection metrics, are expected to stay healthy at 8.0 times and 1.2 times, respectively, mirroring last year's performance and lending stability to credit profiles.

While healthy demand for quality healthcare should keep occupancy high despite the bed addition, the ability of hospitals to sustain operating profitability and regulatory changes will remain monitorable in the road ahead, the report added. (The Hindu)"

The proposed additional tariffs on the US imports from Canada, China, and Mexico went into effect early Tuesday morning (March 4), paving the way for a trade war between the US and major trade partners. In addition, the Presidential Memorandum on Reciprocal Trade and Tariff of the United States (US) has called for studies on the ""unfair trade practices"" of US trade partners to determine reciprocal tariff rates as a counter measure. This means that, if the EU has a 10% automobile tariff, the US reciprocal tariff would also be 10%, matching its trade partner's tariff.

With the US having roughly about 13,000 tariff lines, 200 trading partners, and about 2.6 million individual tariff rates, if the proposed reciprocal tariffs are fully implemented, this complex tariff system may have unprecedented effects on the global economy. This could then potentially lead to retaliation from trade partners.

The threat of reciprocal tariffs could also potentially cause a trade war between the European Union (EU) and the US with the EU likely to decrease imports from countries like Sri Lanka, making sustainable export growth in a more protectionist global economy more difficult for countries like Sri Lanka.

Tariff threats are also being used as a bargaining tool and the US may revise high tariffs in exchange for concessions from major trade partners.

The possible disintegration of the current global free trade system, which may be inevitable if the US implements broad-based tariff hikes, is a great and immediate concern for Sri Lanka, as it is a small economy with limited domestic demand and a high dependency on external value chains.

Given that the US accounts for a quarter of exports from Sri Lanka, if the US government goes ahead with reciprocal tariffs, how would said reciprocal tariffs impact Sri Lanka's exports?

Reciprocal tariff rates: How will the US determine these rates?

The Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) lists various policies as ""unfair trade practices,"" providing flexibility for the US authorities to determine the reciprocal tariff rate. These include high tariffs, value-added taxes, non-tariff barriers, subsidies, burdensome regulatory requirements, exchange rate interventions, and any other practice deemed by the USTR. The US plans to complete all the studies on ""unfair trade practices"" by April 1, 2025.

The flexible definition of what constitutes unfair practices and the inclusion of domestically applied taxes like value-added tax (VAT) have injected substantial uncertainty into the global trade system. Over 170 economies worldwide have VAT, which is a significant revenue source for their governments. VAT is imposed non-discriminately, regardless of the product's origin. If VAT is included in the US reciprocal tariff, the tariff hike will be larger for any economy.

Table 1: The announced US trade policy measures

Reciprocity of tariffs: How will they affect Sri Lanka?

Ignoring VAT, subsidies, and exchange rate interventions, reciprocity can be simplified to import tariffs and para-tariffs. Sri Lanka has general custom duties, an Export Development Board CESS, Excise Duty, Port and Airport Development (PAL), and Social Security Contribution Levy (SSCL). Once the product level tariff rates are calculated on ad-valorem basis, Sri Lanka has a higher tariff rate than the US for almost all sectors (Figure 1).

This implies that, if the US raises tariffs reciprocally, Sri Lanka will be affected directly by increased price levels in the US market (Figure 1). As the magnitude of the negative export effect coming from a reciprocal tariff depends on the tariff differential - i.e. percentage points of tariffs Sri Lanka charges more than the US  - industries such as wearing apparel, rubber and plastic products, and food products, will be more vulnerable to reciprocal tariffs.

The export effect of tariff hikes can be estimated once reciprocal tariff rates are announced, as the magnitude of the effect on Sri Lanka's exports depends on the relative price change compared to the competitors in the US market. Moreover, a uniform coverage across all products may not happen given the inflationary outcome of a tariff. In the first trade war, although the US announced tariffs on apparel and footwear in August, 2019 it was not implemented.

Notes: (Left) The tariff difference (tariff by Sri Lanka on the US minus tariff by the US on Sri Lanka) is given within square brackets. Tariff averages are simple means and not weighted by trade value. (Right) The tariff differential between Sri Lanka and the US is in square brackets. In each sector, Sri Lanka has a higher tariff than the US.

Source: Author's calculations using data from Sri Lanka Customs and WITS.

Reciprocal tariffs, among other policies announced by the US in 2025, should be evaluated under different policy scenarios (Table 1). For instance, if Sri Lanka's key export competitors face a higher relative tariff hike, Sri Lanka may benefit. Under the assumption that Sri Lanka will not face a tariff hike, and the US will focus on large trade partners, the likely effect on Sri Lanka due to trade diversion might be positive. For example, apparel exporters to the US, such as China and Mexico, are directly targeted for higher tariffs. Before the tariff hikes enforced on 4th March, Mexico enjoys zero apparel sector tariffs under the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement (Figure 2).

However, enforced new tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico are estimated to cost a typical US household USD 1,200 annually. Higher prices, alongside recessionary impacts from retaliation and supply chain disruption, will negatively impact most US households, reducing import demand. This may dampen positive gains from any anticipated trade diversion. Similarly, an EU-US trade war will affect the EU economy too, dampening  import demand, including from countries like Sri Lanka.

US reciprocal tariffs, retaliations, and dysfunctional multilateral organisations will break the post-GATT/WTO liberal trade system. Maintaining sustainable export growth in a more protectionist global economy will be increasingly difficult for a country like Sri Lanka.

Figure 2: The US imports of wearing apparel (2024) and effectively applied tariffs for each exporter (2023)

Sri Lanka's options: Phasing out para-tariffs and tightening trade relations

A closer look at Sri Lanka's tariff data shows a heavy reliance on para-tariffs and special commodity levies (SCL). There are plans to phase out para-tariffs and replace the SCL with VAT. Under the Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement too, Sri Lanka has currently phased out a portion of CESS and PAL.

Under the Sri Lanka-Thailand Free Trade Agreement also, para-tariffs are planned to be phased out. Proceeding with such measures and broadening to all trade partners will reduce the differential tariffs between Sri Lanka and the US. Overall, eliminating para-tariffs in the long run can reduce the anti-export bias in the economy, incentivising production for exports.

A more immediate and greater worry for Sri Lanka is the possible disintegration of the current global free trade system, which may be inevitable if the US implements broad-based tariff hikes. As a small economy with limited domestic demand and dependency on external value chains, Sri Lanka's future growth will be drastically affected in a world where countries plunge into protectionism and beggar-thy-neighbor tariff practices.

Anticipating such global circumstances, Sri Lanka needs to tighten trade relations with  regional partners, particularly with the growing middle-income countries in East Asia. Continuation of negotiations for FTAs with East Asian economies and for a more effective Indo-Sri Lanka FTA are sound strategies Sri Lanka may take. Removing the existing hurdles like quotas for apparel sector in the Indian market will yield benefits from the growing middle-class demand in India."

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/05/what-to-know-about-chinas-two-sessions/,2025-03-05,What to know about China's 'two sessions',"It is early March, which in China typically signals the start of the annual ""two sessions"" political season.

So what are the ""two sessions""?

The ""two sessions"" are the annual meetings of China's top legislature, the National People's Congress (NPC), and the top political advisory body, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).

Both bodies serve five-year terms and hold a plenary session each year. The current 14th NPC has nearly 3,000 deputies, while the 14th CPPCC National Committee has over 2,000 members.

The NPC is the highest state organ of power. That means in addition to its duty as the top legislature, it wields the power to elect national leaders, and approve government budgets and national development plans, among others.

The CPPCC serves as an important institution of CPC-led multiparty cooperation and political consultation. It is a specialist consultative body in China's whole-process people's democracy. Its members advise on major national policies and key issues spanning economic, political, cultural, social and ecological development.

The annual sessions of these two bodies usually run in parallel and take place around the same time, which is why they are collectively known as the ""two sessions"". This year, the sessions of the NPC and the CPPCC National Committee are scheduled to open on March 5 and 4, respectively.

What are the major issues at the ""two sessions""?

The first is the annual growth target. The figure, set to be unveiled in the government work report at the start of the NPC session, is among the most anticipated topics every year.

Alongside the GDP target, the government work report is expected to outline other key economic indicators, including the deficit-to-GDP ratio and inflation target. It will also set development priorities for the year.

A plan for national economic and social development of the year, as well as the government budgets, will also be reviewed. These provide a clear picture of China's policy priorities, development goals, and fiscal strategies.

During its annual session, the NPC also enacts or amends laws, particularly those of significant importance. These include the Constitution, the Civil Code, the Supervision Law, and the Foreign Investment Law.

This year, lawmakers will deliberate a draft revision to the Law on Deputies to the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses at All Levels, marking its fourth amendment since its enactment in 1992.

The annual legislative plan will also be announced as lawmakers review the work report of the NPC Standing Committee. Additionally, the heads of the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate will separately deliver their work reports, detailing the performance of the judicial and prosecutorial bodies.

Senior government officials will also meet the press on the sidelines of the ""two sessions,"" with a highly anticipated event being the foreign minister's press conference. This event typically outlines China's positions and policies on foreign affairs. (China Daily)"

As the Katchatheevu festival at the St. Antony's Church is scheduled to take place on March 14 and 15, the fishermen associations decided to take the next course of action after the event. But, they said that the rail roko agitation would happen in the event of non-compliance of their demands by the governments.

According to Mr Jesu Raja, the fishermen may venture into the sea from Saturday (March 8). They had stayed away from normal fishing activities since February 24, he said. (The Hindu)"
https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/05/what-undue-advantage-indian-coach-slams-critics/,2025-03-05,'What undue advantage?' Indian Coach slams critics,"India coach Gautam Gambhir on Tuesday lashed out at critics of his team playing every game in Dubai, after beating Australia by four wickets in the Champions Trophy semi-finals.

India will face South Africa or New Zealand in the final on Sunday in Dubai. India have played all their matches at the same venue after they refused to tour nominal hosts Pakistan for the eight-nation event.

Lahore would have hosted the final had India missed out.

India remain unbeaten with four victories at the Dubai International Stadium, while other teams have had to travel between three Pakistani cities and Dubai.

South Africa were forced to travel to Dubai despite not knowing if they would even be playing their semi-final there, and then had to travel straight back to Pakistan after India's win over New Zealand.

India also knew they would be playing the first semi-final before the tournament even started if they got that far, while other teams had to wait to see where India finished in their group.

India are unbeaten in the 10 ODIs they have played in Dubai, winning nine.

""First of all, this is as neutral a venue for us as it is for any other team,"" an agitated Gambhir told reporters, insisting India had not enjoyed any advantage over other teams because they were not playing at home.

""We have not played here. I don't remember which tournament we played in this stadium last. And in fact, we didn't plan anything like that...

""The plan was that if you pick two front-line spinners in the 15-man squad, then even if we played in Pakistan or anywhere, we would have picked two front-line spinners because it was a competition on the subcontinent.""

Ironically, Gambhir delivered his spicy retort while sitting behind a sign on the press conference podium that read: ""ICC Champions Trophy 2025 -- Pakistan.""

India won their last group match against New Zealand with four spinners and emerged victorious again with similar tactics.

""It was nothing like we wanted to set up a spinners' trap,"" Gambhir said, focusing on the pitch rather than the discrepancies in travel between teams and schedule concerns.

""If you look at it, we only played one front-line spinner in the first three matches. We only played two front-line spinners in this match or the previous match. So, it was nothing like that.

""And there's a lot of debate about the undue advantage and all that. What undue advantage? We haven't practised here even for a day. We're practising at the ICC Academy.

""If you look at the wickets there and here, the difference is between the ground and the sky. Some people are just perpetual cribbers, man.

""They've got to grow up. So, I feel that there was nothing like we had any undue advantage or we had planned something like that."" (Fox Sports)"

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/06/healthcare-sector-challenges-sajith-highlights-07-key-issues/,2025-03-06,Healthcare Sector challenges : Sajith highlights 07 key issues,"Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has raised concerns over seven (07) key issues related to Sri Lanka's healthcare professionals.

He raised the matter when speaking in Parliament today on disease prevention and treatment.

MP Premadasa revealed there are significant challenges in developing the healthcare sector and retaining professionals in the country. According to the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA), the allowance rate for additional duties of all categories of doctors has been reduced from 1/80 to 1/120 per hour. Additionally, the allowance for working on holidays and Sundays has been cut from 1/20 to 1/30, he said.

He further highlighted the difficulties faced by medical professionals, including reduced retention and transport allowances, unresolved vehicle permit issues, inadequate allowances for resident doctors, and outdated financial support for postgraduate medical education. As a result, a significant number of doctors have already left the country, with more preparing to migrate for foreign medical opportunities.

The Opposition Leader pointed out similar issues in the nursing profession, stating that the government holiday and weekly rest day allowance has been reduced from 1/20 to 1/30 of the basic salary, while the hourly service allowance has been cut from 1/160 to 1/200.

Emphasizing the crucial role of nurses in the healthcare sector, he urged the government to reconsider its treatment of nursing professionals, particularly at a time when the country is facing a severe shortage of nurses. He also criticized the government's stance toward nurses who participated in political rallies while in uniform.

MP Premadasa further highlighted the struggles faced by Allied Health Science Graduates, many of whom remain unemployed despite coming through the free education system. He urged the government to provide employment opportunities and proceed with new recruitments.

Additionally, he raised concerns about Ayurvedic graduates, stating that approximately 1,800 graduates are currently unemployed despite 600 vacancies in the indigenous medicine sector. He noted that around 200 Ayurvedic graduates complete their internship training annually and called for immediate solutions.

The Ayurveda Act No. 19 of 2023 has created significant challenges for Ayurvedic entrepreneurs, manufacturers, and shop owners involved in the cultivation, processing, sale, and distribution of indigenous medicines.

MP Premadasa emphasized that this has also inconvenienced patients and urged the government to provide necessary solutions.

MP Premadasa also called for the permanent appointment of Dengue Control Assistant Officers, who currently work on a salary scale of Rs. 22,000.

He urged the government to intervene and regularize their employment status.

The Opposition Leader stressed the importance of overtime allowances for junior hospital staff, who provide essential services but do not receive proper compensation.

He also highlighted the struggles of Family Health Service Officers, who receive just Rs. 2 per kilometer as travel expenses, despite lacking adequate facilities.

With vacancies in this field, 937 candidates are awaiting appointments, while another 1,200 are currently in training. MP Premadasa called for immediate solutions, recognizing the critical role of disease prevention efforts.

MP Sajith Premadasa asserted that health and education are fundamental human rights. While Sri Lanka's Constitution recognizes civil and political rights, he stressed that economic, social, cultural, health and educational rights must also be upheld.

He called on the government to officially recognize healthcare as a human right and assured the full support of the opposition in ensuring its realization. (Newswire)

Issuing the judgement, the judge said Police evidence revealed how they had gone to the house and investigated after receiving information that attempts were being made to bury the body of the child without proper medical examinations.

The Police evidence further states due to suspicion a magisterial inquiry had ordered the postmortem examination to be conducted.

As such, the Judicial Medical Officers' report had proven that the child had been subjected to severe torture. The child's body was found with 90 injuries, out of which some were burn injuries and some were due to assault, while there were severe injuries to his testicles as well, the JMO report said.

The Judge said the JMO's report proves that the child had been subjected to severe torture and his death had occurred due to intentional violence. The report also claimed that the child died due to multiple injuries caused by burns after being subjected to torture for a long period of time.

The judge said, analyzing all the evidence, it has been confirmed that the deceased child lived in the custody of these defendants, and according to the forensic and medical evidence presented, the defendants are responsible for the death. (Newswire)"

During the proceedings, NGJA Chairman Naveen Sooriyarachchi said that the authority does not receive import data from Sri Lanka Customs, making it difficult to maintain accurate records and valuations.

COPE members referred to media reports of an unauthorized release of gemstones in 2024, confirming that the parcel in question was valued at 21,096 karats (approximately USD 78,017). Officials admitted that no approval had been sought from the NGJA Board of Directors for the release of the jewels in September 2024.

Following legal action, when the gemstones were recovered, a portion of them was missing, a COPE member disclosed.

Valuation Discrepancies

Further questioning revealed that at the time of the incident, Ramesh Pathirana served as the Cabinet Minister overseeing the sector, while Chamara Sampath Dassanayake was the State Minister. COPE members also inquired whether Viraj de Silva, the NGJA chairman at the time, had been appointed by Dassanayake.

The COPE was informed that after the gemstones were recovered, they were released to the same individual upon payment of a fine of just Rs. 10,000.

The NGJA Export and Sales Director said that the board had approved the release based on instructions from another official, who was also present at the hearing. However, when questioned by COPE, the said official contradicted the previous official's remarks, stating that he did not authorise the release.

Meanwhile, Valuation Director of the Authority said that she had noted discrepancies in the valuations and estimates recorded in invoices. Again, officials were unable to explain why the initial valuation of the gemstones was Rs. 20 million (2 crores) but later increased to Rs. 150 million (15 crores).

Industries Ministry Secretary Thilaka Jayasundara who was also present at the hearing expressed frustration over the incident, stating that Sri Lanka could have generated greater revenue if the NGJA had not been involved. She cited her own negative experiences in the state sector as the reason for her remarks.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/06/un-women-sl-unveils-samatheevu-a-vision-for-a-gender-equal-world/,2025-03-06,UN Women SL unveils SamaTheevu - a vision for a gender-equal world,"UN Women Sri Lanka today declared open සමதீவு (SamaTheevu), a public installation that brings to life a vision of a gender-equal world - a goal that remains urgent and achievable with collective action.

According to the organization, the installation is open to the public from 06-12 March from 9:00 am - 8:00 pm at the Lionel Wendt, Art Centre, in Colombo 07.

The launch of සමதீவு aligns with International Women's Day and the 30th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action - recognized as the most comprehensive and visionary blueprint for achieving gender equality and advancing women's rights.

Sri Lanka has long demonstrated its commitment to gender equality. In 1981 Sri Lanka ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) reinforcing its commitment to protecting the rights of women and girls. Building on this, in 1995, Sri Lanka joined 189 other countries in adopting the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action at the Fourth World Conference on Women.

Despite some progress, women's labour force participation in Sri Lanka has stagnated and regressed between 2020 and 2025. The proportion of women in parliament has remained below 10% in the 77 years since Sri Lanka's independence and 24% of women have experienced physical or sexual violence by their intimate partner. In 2006, Sri Lanka took 13th place in closing the gender gap, whereas in 2024, it stood at 122nd place.

Speaking on this at the launch event, Deputy Minister of Women and Child Affairs, Dr. Namal Sudarshana said: ""While progress has been made since 1995, we know that the status of Sri Lankan women has stagnated against several indicators on gender equality, owing to multiple crises. The 30th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration this year is a pivotal moment, and the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs remains committed to protecting the rights of women and advancing gender equality in the country"".

Emphasizing on collective action to accelerate progress on gender equality, Marc-André Franche, Resident Coordinator of the UN in Sri Lanka highlighted: ""As Sri Lanka's obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women were recently reviewed, this is a pivotal moment for the country to assess progress, identify gaps, and most importantly accelerate actions to meet its commitments on gender equality and women's empowerment. The UN in Sri Lanka remains committed to supporting Sri Lanka in this journey"".

The interactive installation offers visitors a glimpse into an island where everyone, regardless of gender has equal rights and opportunities in all aspects of life. It serves as a powerful reminder that gender equality is not only a fundamental human right but also a driver of social and economic progress. It also serves as a rallying call for all sectors of society to contribute to a future where every individual can thrive without discrimination.

As Sri Lankan women activists were a key part of shaping the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, Emeritus Professor of Law, Savitri Goonesekere who attended the Beijing Conference in 1995 said: ""Celebrating 30 years since the adoption of the Beijing Platform for Action is surely a time to reflect on past developments relating to gender equality and to address new realities - including the challenges of IT, cybercrimes, and AI - in formulating a new path to eliminate discrimination against women. The reality of discrimination and denial of life chances in our country and community requires activists and women's groups to also understand past developments, trends, failures, gaps, and limitations as they formulate new interventions to realize gender equality.""

""At UN Women, our goal is to uphold human rights and sustainable development for all"", said Ramaaya Salgado, Head of Office at UN Women Sri Lanka. ""Global data shows us that societies where everyone - regardless of gender - is equally valued, given equal opportunities, and supported by just institutions - will flourish, and achieving these goals requires collective efforts"".

SamaTheevu serves as a rallying call to inspire action to advance women's rights and gender equality by challenging all forms of violence, discrimination and exploitation; while fostering empowerment to ensure inclusive access to education, employment, leadership, and decision-making spaces.

Michael, 56 - who's previously raised concern over people being ""ripped off"" by lenders - spent two years working on a ""secret"" project about the debt and credit industry. His efforts to help people affected by debt will be shown in a documentary that is set to air on Channel 4 next week.

It's teased that the documentary sees a debt acquisition company set up. Through that, he's said to have been able to write off £1 million-worth of debt for around 900 people in his home region of South Wales using £100,000 of his own money.

The BAFTA nominee - who's starred in films like Frost/Nixon (2008) and the Twilight Saga - has shared that he doesn't know the identity of those he has helped. Michael has said that he wants to ""draw attention"" to the experiences of people struggling with debt and hopes to raise awareness of ""alternatives"" to help ""make a difference for people"".

A teaser clip for the documentary, Michael Sheen's Secret Million Pound Giveaway, shows him sat in a cafe in his hometown of Port Talbot, where its last remaining blast furnace was shut down last year. Addressing job losses in the community, Michael says: ""The ladies who work here, before we started filming, told me that tomorrow, it's the last ship, the last boat load coming into the dock here to deliver stuff to the steelworks. And now they've described people sitting in here just crying at these tables. [...] So it couldn't be more real like how much people are hurting.""

Michael spoke about the documentary on the One Show on Tuesday evening. He said: ""I didn't have £100,000 to throw around so I wanted it to be effective. When I realised that I could do this ... that I could get £1 million's worth of debt and just write it off, it seemed like a good thing to do.""

Explaining how it works, he said: ""Essentially, people's debt gets sort of put into bundles and then debt buying companies can buy those bundles. And then they can sell it off to another debt buying company at a lower price. So the debt itself ... even though the amount that people owe is still the same ... the people who own the debt can sell it for less and less money.""

Michael continued: ""So I was able to set up a company and, for £100,000 of my own money, buy £1 million worth of debt cause it had come down in value like that because they find like ... they don't see that there's as much chance to get the money back or whatever the reason might be. It's bizarre.""

He later revealed that he ""didn't know"" and still doesn't know the identities of the people whose debt he bought. He shared on the BBC talk show: ""I knew where they would live and I knew the kind of debt it was but I would never know who they are and I still don't know who they are.""

Michael also shared: ""The shocking thing is that people have started having to use credit cards, overdrafts to pay for basics. Y'know to pay for necessities rather than luxuries or anything like that. So the debt that I was able to buy included credit card debt, overdrafts, car finance, that kind of stuff.

""So now obviously I can't know exactly in a granular way what they were spending their money on but I know from talking to people that this is just ... people are going through unexpected events like an illness or a washing machine breaks down, or a car, or even just Christmas. And you need some help to get through these times and people were getting into spirals of debt. And once you get [yourself] underwater, it's very hard to get out again."" (Mirror UK)"

""We need urgent, proactive measures to address before trade walls block our access to the US - our largest export market. Inexperience in foreign policy isn't an excuse. As #COPF Chair, I'm ready to assist,"" he added.

Earlier in March, President Trump announced that he was moving forward with 25% tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico into the US, adding that time had run out to reach a deal.

An additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports is also expected to come into force, leaving all three of America's top three trade partners facing significantly higher trade barriers than just a few weeks ago. (Newswire)"

Mahinda Samarasinghe.

According to the Sri Lankan Embassy in Washington, D.C., the group is conversant in the traditional art forms of Sri Lanka including Kandyan dance.

The visiting team will be led by the 11th President of Randolph College, Prof. Sue Ott Rowlands, who believes in the importance of global partnerships and has cherished Sri Lanka since her first visit in 2010. She was introduced to the country by Sri Lankan academic, geopolitics and foreign policy analyst, Asanga Abeyagoonasekera.  Prof. Rowlands has a widely consequential career in leadership in the performing arts in several colleges across the US, with acclaimed expertise in drama and theatre. She has also delivered remarkable solo performances in a number of countries.

The visit will cover the UNESCO heritage sites in Anuradhapura, Kandy and Galle, and the group anticipates a highly rewarding and meaningful cultural experience, with an expert in the subject from Peradeniya University to accompany them. They hope to visit several architectural masterpieces of Geoffrey Bawa, one of the most influential Asian architects of his time. The academics also hope to pay a visit to the village of Sirambiyadi off Puttalam, to learn about the Kaffir traditions of the last clan of versatile Africans in Sri Lanka. During the sojourn in Colombo, they hope to interact with the University of Visual and Performing Arts and lay a firm foundation for greater cultural collaboration in the future.

Moreover, two Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with the University of Peradeniya, and Sri Palee Campus of the University of Colombo focused on student and cultural exchanges, and demography-related research programs are scheduled to be signed. Specific projects in relation to the two general MOUs will be followed later.

The Randolph College offers Kandyan dance for academic credits, for the first time in its history and perhaps for the first time in the history of Liberal Arts in the US.  This initiative was spearheaded by a permanent Faculty Member at the University of Peradeniya, and Quillian Visiting International Scholar at Randolph College, Dr. Sudesh Mantillake.  He also organized the Movement Rhizome: Quillian International Symposium on Sri Lanka, which delved into Sri Lanka's culture, history, and resilience through performances, workshops, and academic discussions.

Farcical, laughable': David Lloyd blasts ICC over Champions Trophy scheduling","The ICC Champions Trophy has come into deep criticism for its organisation and some confusion surrounding the scheduling and travel circumstances, forced on by the mandate for India to play their games in the UAE while the rest of the tournament takes place in Pakistan.

This came to a head as the South African team was forced to fly to Dubai and back to Lahore in quick succession, due to the semifinal locations and matchups not being set until less than 48 hours before the first semifinal in Dubai was set to begin.

Former English player and pundit David 'Bumble' Lloyd commentated on his thoughts on the matter, not biting his tongue as he explained his take on the situation, on a video posted by a user on X.

""It's really embarrassing that this is one of the highest, most important events in world cricket, and the arrangements of playing are farcical,"" said Lloyd.

""It's laughable, that you have to do that. I mean, words fail me.""

The English commentator has been fiercely critical of ICC tournament scheduling, last year speaking his mind on the manner in which Pakistan and India were put in the same group repeatedly.

'It is just nonsense...'

On this occasion, both Australia and South Africa were forced to travel to Dubai on Sunday, with India's result against New Zealand determining which of the two teams would play in the first semifinal against India in Dubai, and which in the second against New Zealand. The fact that their group was settled but the semifinal wasn't was a source of perplexity for many within the cricket world.

""It is just nonsense. I really don't know how else to describe it, this is a world event,"" continued Lloyd.. ""You have teams who go from here to there, you might play here, you might not, you might have to go back.""

""I'm quite a humorous guy and I think that's quite funny actually, but it's not so funny if I'm one of the players,"" concluded Lloyd.

India were able to capitalise on their home base of Dubai to beat Australia in the semifinal, while the confusion and exertion surrounding South Africa's round-trip might well have played a part in them crashing out of the tournament against New Zealand a day later.

The choice to have two games in the span of three days in Dubai was the source of this confusion, leading to mass criticism of the ICC's scheduling favouring India at the expense of other teams. Nonetheless, India have reached their third consecutive Champions Trophy final, which will be played in Dubai against the Kiwis. (Hindustan Times)

I recently interacted with a chatbot for a simple service request, expecting a quick and easy solution. Instead, I found myself stuck in a loop of scripted responses, with no way to get the assistance I needed. What should have been a straightforward experience became frustrating and time-consuming.

This made me wonder--are businesses actually using AI to improve customer service, or are they just automating inefficiency? While Conversational AI and WhatsApp automation have the potential to transform customer interactions, many businesses are still relying on rigid, rule-based chatbots that follow pre-scripted flows and struggle with anything outside their programmed responses.

Where Traditional Chatbots Fail in Customer Service

Most of us have experienced situations where chatbots--designed to automate customer interactions--end up making things harder. The issue isn't automation itself but how it's being implemented. Here are some common examples:

1. Getting Stuck in an Endless Loop
Imagine trying to check your mobile data balance through a telecom provider's chatbot. You ask, ""How much data do I have left?"" but instead of answering, it responds with ""Here are our latest data packages!"" You try again, and it gives you the same response.

The problem here? The chatbot isn't designed to understand intent - it's simply matching keywords to scripted responses. It doesn't realize that you're looking for your current balance, not new data plans. A Conversational AI system, on the other hand, would understand the request, retrieve the information, and even ask a follow-up like ""Would you like to set a reminder before your data runs out?""

2. No Way to Handle Open-Ended Requests
A customer forgets their mobile banking password and tries to reset it using a bank's chatbot on WhatsApp. The bot presents a fixed menu of options: ""Check balance,"" ""View recent transactions,"" ""Report a lost card."" Resetting a password isn't listed.

Since traditional chatbots can only process predefined inputs, they don't handle open-ended queries well. In contrast, Conversational AI could recognize, ""I need to reset my password,"" ask clarifying questions, and then either guide the customer through a secure reset process or escalate to a human agent.

3. Turning Simple Tasks into a Frustrating Experience
A customer orders a phone case from an online store and wants to check their delivery status. They open the store's WhatsApp chatbot, expecting a quick response like ""Your package will arrive on Tuesday."" Instead, they are asked to log into an account, enter an order number, and navigate multiple menu options.

A Conversational AI-powered WhatsApp experience, on the other hand, could instantly recognize the user based on their phone number, retrieve the latest tracking information, and even proactively update them if the delivery is delayed.

4. AI That Pushes Sales Instead of Understanding the Customer
A customer buys a pair of sneakers from a retail app. A week later, they message the chatbot via WhatsApp to return them because they don't fit. Instead of assisting, the bot responds with ""Here are some other sneaker options you might like!""

This happens because most basic chatbots are designed for sales automation, not customer support. Conversational AI, however, could identify that the user is making a return request, guide them through the process, and even ask if they'd prefer an exchange or refund--just like a human customer service agent would.

How Businesses Can Get AI-Powered Customer Service Right

AI is not the problem - poor implementation is. Here's how businesses can move beyond rigid chatbots and start leveraging Conversational AI and WhatsApp automation effectively:

1. Move from Scripted Responses to Real Conversations
Basic chatbots operate on fixed decision trees, meaning they only understand pre-programmed inputs. If a customer asks something outside of those options, the bot fails. Conversational AI changes this by understanding intent, handling follow-up questions, and providing contextually relevant responses - allowing for natural, free-flowing dialogue.

2. Ensure AI Can Recognize When It's Out of Its Depth
Not all queries can be fully automated, and that's okay. The best Conversational AI systems seamlessly transfer complex or high-priority cases to human agents without making customers repeat themselves. If a business uses WhatsApp for customer engagement, this means ensuring the chatbot can switch to a live agent within the same conversation when needed.

3. Focus on Customer Convenience, Not Just Automation
Businesses should ask themselves: Are we using AI to genuinely improve customer service, or just to cut costs? The best AI-powered experiences are proactive - anticipating customer needs, reducing steps, and delivering personalized assistance.

For example, instead of making a customer request an update on their order, why not have WhatsApp automation proactively send real-time delivery updates? Instead of making a user ask for a refund, why not let Conversational AI detect dissatisfaction and offer assistance first?

The Future of AI in Customer Engagement
Customers today don't just want faster responses - they want smarter interactions. Businesses that move beyond traditional chatbots and embrace Conversational AI on WhatsApp and other messaging platforms will create experiences that are more natural, efficient, and human-like.

The key takeaway? AI should work for customers, not against them. Businesses that prioritize customer convenience over automation for the sake of automation are the ones truly benefiting from AI.

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/06/trump-announces-reciprocal-tariffs-on-india-from-april/,2025-03-06,Trump announces reciprocal tariffs on India from April,"President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on India starting April 2, signaling a tough path ahead in the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations, which could clash with these sweeping tariffs.

New Delhi, however, remains hopeful that the understanding reached between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Trump on February 13 will help resolve trade issues and keep the September deadline for signing the first tranche of the FTA. Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal has began his US trip on Monday to meet the new United States Trade Representative (USTR), Jamieson Greer.

In his first address of his second term to a joint session of Congress, President Trump defended his strict tariff policies, highlighting that the US has long faced high tariffs from several countries, including India. He announced that his administration would impose reciprocal tariffs on several countries starting April 2.

""On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada have you heard of them? And countless other nations charge us tremendously high tariffs than we charge them, It's very unfair,"" Trump said.

Trump had previously referred to India as a ""tariff king"" and highlighted the auto sector, saying that India imposes tariffs of over 100 percent. ""India charges us 100 per cent tariffs; the system is not fair to the US, it never was. On April 2, reciprocal tariffs kick in. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them. If they use non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will use non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market,"" Trump said.

Soon after announcing the reciprocal tariff, the White House put out a factsheet talking about India's high tariff: The U.S. average applied Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff on agricultural goods is 5%. But, India's average applied MFN tariff is 39%. India also charges a 100% tariff on US motorcycles, while we only charge a 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles.

New Delhi is hopeful that ""trade issues can be sorted mutually"" as India-US ties are ""multifaceted"" in line with the understanding arrived at the meeting between Prime Minister Modi and President Trump. ""We have a roadmap that will ensure we sort out any issue through consultations,"" said a source.

India has taken steps to enhance market access for US agricultural products like alfalfa hay, duck meat, and medical devices and lowered tariffs on US products, such as bourbon whiskey, motorcycles, ICT products, and metals. ""The plan we have chalked out while setting a trade target of 500 billion USD by 20230 is mutually agreeable. It has many elements as agreed between the leadership of two countries including increasing US industrial exports to India and expanding Indian exports of labor-intensive products to the US,"" said the source.

The US reciprocal tariffs also overlook several World Trade Organization agreements, such as preferential trade arrangements, put emerging economies like India to a tight spot. (Indian Express)"

The formula price of 92-octane petrol was Rs.298.85 in January 2025, rose to Rs. 307.53 in February, and reached Rs. 310.14 in March--an overall increase of Rs. 11.29 per litre.

As a result, where the formula price was Rs. 10.15 below the market price in January, it exceeded the market price by Rs. 1.14 in March.

Currently, the market price falls within a 2% range of the formula price, indicating that market prices are effectively on par with the formula price.

However, the market price of auto diesel, which was Rs. 2.14 lower than the formula price in February, is now Rs. 4.16 higher.

This change is due to a reduction in the formula price from Rs. 288.14 in February to Rs. 281.84 in March, while the market price remained unchanged.

Passengers on the flight who witnessed the incident said the teenager was dressed in high-visibility reflective gear, and seemed to be trying to pass himself off as airport or aircraft maintenance.

One of the passengers, Barry Clark, a former shearer and boxer, told Australian news outlet The Age that he and other passengers became suspicious after an onboard announcement said checks had been completed, yet the teenager, who was dressed looking like an aircraft maintenance engineer and mechanic, remained onboard.

When a flight attendant questioned the teenager, Clark noticed the shotgun barrel by the teen's side.

Clark then sprung into action and tried to safely seize the weapon. He was soon joined by a pilot. Video footage of the moment was captured by other passengers and uploaded to various social media channels, including X.

The teenager was held on the ground until police arrived. Officers then took him into custody for questioning.

Superintendent Michael Reid told ABC News that the teenager acted alone and had entered Avalon Airport via a hole in a security fence.

A spokesperson for Avalon Airport said the matter was being handled by police, and the airport would be closed until further notice.

In a strongly worded statement, Sabry accused the interviewer of conducting an outright interrogation rather than a fair discussion. ""This wasn't about getting answers. It wasn't about journalism. It was about pushing an agenda,"" he said, criticizing Hasan's approach as hostile and biased.

Sabry alleged that the audience had been carefully selected to create a hostile environment for Wickremesinghe. ""A hostile anti-Sri Lankan audience was deliberately picked to make the guest feel like he was in enemy territory. That shows how well-choreographed the event was,"" he stated.

Full Statement

A Premeditated Attack Disguised as Journalism

I've watched Mehdi Hasan before, he's always aggressive and combative. But even by his usual standards, his interview with Ranil Wickremesinghe was deeply premeditated. This wasn't about getting answers. It wasn't about journalism. It was about pushing an agenda, an outright interrogation where the objective was to attack, not engage.

A hostile anti Sri Lankan audience has been carefully picked to make the guest feel like in an enemy territory goes how well choreographed the event was.

There's a way to ask tough questions while still being fair. Instead, Mehdi shouted over responses, cut off explanations, and twisted words to fit his own narrative. If the answer didn't suit him, he simply refused to listen.

I've seen how he operates, but I wonder does he apply the same treatment to leaders from powerful nations? Does he aggressively grill them on their failures, their war crimes, their human rights abuses with this same level of hostility? Or is this reserved for leaders from smaller nations like ours?

No one is saying Sri Lanka is without flaws. We have work to do. We need reforms. We need accountability. But that's our fight. Sri Lankans will decide the future of Sri Lanka, not a journalist with an agenda, not an international media outlet with selective scrutiny.

Public service is often a thankless job. But distorting facts, rewriting history, and weaponizing interviews to undermine a country's progress is shameful.

You may love him or hate him, but you can't deny the facts, when Sri Lanka hit rock bottom, RW stepped in and pulled the country out of an economic recession and quagmire. Not once, but twice, first in 2001 and again in 2022. No one else had the courage to take responsibility when it mattered most. At the very least, we must show some gratitude.

And let's not get carried away celebrating this so-called ""takedown."" No contemporary politician in Sri Lanka could have stood up to that level of bullying and hostility. RW, once again, proved why he stands apart.

Sri Lanka will move forward, not on the terms of an international journalist with an agenda, but on our own."

The Minister made this statement during the first meeting of the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Energy of the First Session of the Tenth Parliament, which was held recently (06) at the Parliament under his Chairmanship.

During the meeting held, Members of Parliament inquired about the said project, Minister Kumara Jayakody further stated that, as the pricing of Adani Company's power project was high, the matter had been referred to the Cabinet for reconsideration. At that time, Indian Adani parent company had sent a letter to the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka informing that they were withdrawing from this project, and accordingly, the Board of Investment had informed the Ministry regarding the same, the minister further said. However, discussions regarding the wind power project were held with the representative institution of Adani in Sri Lanka, and thus, that institution had been informed to consider this matter, the Minister pointed out. Therefore, the Minister stated that a response regarding this matter is expected within two weeks following the letter that was sent.

He further emphasized that only if a negative response is received within these two weeks it will be necessary to move toward an alternative. Additionally, he stated that in the future, such projects will only be carried out through government-to-government (G2G) agreements and competitive procurement.

Furthermore, attention was also drawn regarding the steps taken to fill the existing vacancies in the Ceylon Electricity Board, including for engineers. The officials present pointed out that during the period of economic crisis, many engineers had migrated overseas, creating vacancies. However, they further noted that Cabinet approval had recently been obtained to fill these vacancies under three phases, and recruitment for the first batch is currently underway.

Moreover, discussions were held regarding unexpected power outages, with officials highlighting that even minor fluctuations in the system have the potential to destabilize it. Therefore, they stated that efforts are currently being made to maintain system stability by utilizing other energy sources such as solar power.

Additionally, attention was drawn to the inadequate maintenance of streetlights, and the Committee emphasized the necessity for local government institutions and the Electricity Board to work together on this matter. Particularly, as this is a nationally essential issue, the Committee suggested that local government institutions and the Electricity Board should engage in discussions. Moreover, the Minister stated that a policy on this matter will be formulated and finalized within two months.

Furthermore, discussions were held regarding matters related to the Ministry at the provincial, district, and divisional levels. (Parliament)"

K. Stalin on Friday wrote to India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, apprising him of the arrest of 14 Tamil Nadu fishermen by Sri Lanka and sought effective steps for the release of all the detained fishermen and their fishing boats.

As of date, 227 Tamil Nadu fishing boats and 107 fishermen are still under the custody of Sri Lankan authorities, Stalin said.

Expressing anguish, the chief minister said that 14 fishermen who ventured for fishing from the Rameswaram fishing harbour of Ramanathapuram District were apprehended by Sri Lanka and their mechanised fishing boat was also seized on March 6, 2025.

This is the ninth incident of apprehension of Tamil Nadu fishermen along with their boats by the Sri Lankan Navy in the last 2 months of the current year 2025, the chief minister said in his letter.

""With deep concern, I would like to point out that as on date 227 Tamil Nadu fishing boats and 107 fishermen are still under the custody of Sri Lankan authorities. The Sri Lankan authorities are now detaining fishermen for longer period of time and have started imposing heavy fines for their release. Beyond the hardships of imprisonment, fines, and lost income during the detention period, fishermen are now facing an even greater loss of their economic livelihoods, as the Sri Lankan government are not returning their boats which are their sole means of economic support,"" the Chief Minister said.

In a statement, the Prime Minister stressed on the urgent need to confront structural barriers, gender-based violence, and political exclusion that continue to impact women, particularly those in marginalized communities. She highlighted the importance of ensuring women's voices are central to decision-making as Sri Lanka navigates economic recovery, climate change, and democratic challenges.

Full statement:

Today, as we mark International Women's Day, we stand at a crucial moment in history. This is a time to come together--not just to celebrate the progress we have made, but to confront the deep structural inequalities as well as misogynistic ideologies that continue to shape the lives of women, in all their diversity--not only in Sri Lanka but all over the world.

Gender-based violence, economic hardship, and political exclusion disproportionately affect women--particularly those from rural communities, war-affected regions, plantations, and the informal labour sector. No woman is safe until every single woman is safe. We must commit to protecting one another, ensuring that no one is left behind, and that the rights and safety of every woman are upheld.

Women make up 52% of our population, and we received universal franchise in 1931. At the last election we were able to significantly increase the number of women in parliament. While we celebrate that we need to acknowledge that it is still too low.

Our democracy is incomplete when a significant portion of our citizens is excluded from leadership and decision-making. At a time when Sri Lanka is navigating economic recovery, climate change, digital transformation, and democratic challenges, we cannot afford to side-line half of our population. Women's voices, leadership, and agency are essential to overcoming these challenges and building a resilient future for all.

Feminist movements have long shown us that change is possible--but only when we challenge the status quo and demand systemic transformation. As the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, I reaffirm my unwavering commitment to advancing policies that center the rights and agency of women and girls. This IWD, let us commit to transformative action--not just in words, but through gender-sensitive policies, budgets, and the lived experiences of all women and marginalized communities.

When women thrive, communities thrive. When women lead, nations transform. This International Women's Day, let's unite and move beyond words. Let's commit to real, lasting change--for the generations before us, for those fighting today, and for those who will come after. (Newswire)"

https://www.newswire.lk/2025/03/08/south-carolina-executes-inmate-by-firing-squad/,2025-03-08,South Carolina Executes Inmate by Firing Squad,"The state of South Carolina in US executed a prisoner on Friday evening with a firing squad, an extremely rare method that had not been used in the United States since 2010.

The inmate, Brad Sigmon, 67, was convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend's parents, David and Gladys Larke, with a baseball bat in 2001.

A judge had ordered Mr. Sigmon to choose from three methods of execution: lethal injection, electrocution or firing squad. His lawyer, Gerald King, said that Mr. Sigmon had chosen to be shot because he had concerns about South Carolina's lethal injection process.

Mr. Sigmon is the first inmate to be killed in such a manner in the state's history. Polls show that a majority of Americans favor the death penalty, but many view the firing squad as an archaic form of justice. But as lethal injection drugs have become harder to obtain, and have at times resulted in botched executions, several states have recently legalized firing squads as an execution method.

Utah had previously been the only state to use a firing squad in modern times; it did so in 2010, 1996 and 1977.

Mr. Sigmon was executed in the death chamber at the Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia, S.C., the state capital.

He was strapped to a metal chair that sits above a catch basin in a corner of the room. The chair was 15 feet from a wall with a rectangular opening. Behind the wall was a three-person firing squad facing Mr. Sigmon through the opening.

Witnesses sat in chairs along one wall of the chamber behind bullet-resistant glass.

Mr. Sigmon's lawyers had asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review his case and issue a stay of execution, but the court did not grant one. Mr. Sigmon had also asked Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, for clemency, but that was denied. The governor has not granted clemency to a prisoner on death row since the state restarted executions last year.

Because of a shield law passed in 2023, little is known about the members of the firing squad. According to a spokeswoman with the Department of Corrections, they train every month, year-round. A 2022 news release about renovations to the death chamber said that the firing squad consisted of department employees who volunteered to take part. They shoot a type of ammunition often used in police rifles.

Three other states -- Mississippi, Oklahoma and Idaho -- allow the firing squad as a secondary method of execution, to be used only if a lethal injection drug cannot be obtained. In Idaho, the State Senate recently passed a bill that would make death by firing squad the primary method.

The firing squad became legal in South Carolina in 2021, after the state passed a law that allowed death by electric chair or firing squad as options for people on death row. Inmates sued the state, claiming that both methods were cruel, corporal or unusual punishments, which are prohibited by the State Constitution.

The South Carolina Supreme Court, which is dominated by Republican appointees, ruled last year that both methods were legal, writing that neither could be considered cruel or unusual because prisoners chose their method.

Since that ruling, the state's Department of Corrections has now executed four people, three of whom chose to be killed by lethal injection. (NY Times)"
