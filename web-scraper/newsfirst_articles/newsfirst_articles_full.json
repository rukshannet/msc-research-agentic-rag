        "content": "COLOMBO News 1st On Sunday 9 night, officers from the Criminal Investigation Department CID had conducted a search at a residence in Matara to locate former Inspector General of Police IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon. The search was carried out by officers in civilian attire, according to Dishan Gunasekara, the Basnayake Nilame of Ruhunu Kataragama Devalaya.The CID stated that the search was based on information received, but they did not confirm finding Tennakoon at the residence.Dishan Gunasekara, the Basnayake Nilame of Ruhunu Kataragama Devalaya, expressed concerns about the manner of the search, noting that the officers did not present any search warrant or identification. He mentioned that only his 84-year-old mother and two servants were at home during the search.\"My mother, who is 84 years old, was alone with two servants. There were no uniformed officers, and they did not present any legal documents. They couldn't even reveal their identities. When the local police were contacted, they were unaware of the search,\" Gunasekara said.He added that the officers recorded a statement from his mother, who confirmed that they did not cause any harm. However, Gunasekara criticized the disturbance caused to his elderly mother, who requires daily medication.Gunasekara also mentioned that the officers asked if Tennakoon was present at the residence, which he found troubling. He urged the authorities to avoid such actions that cause unnecessary distress to citizens.When asked if Tennakoon was hiding at his residence, Gunasekara laughed and did not provide a direct answer.Meanwhile, Gunasekara was summoned to the CID today for a separate investigation. After providing a statement for nearly three hours, he left the CID premises.Gunasekara explained that he was called to provide information about a house built for former President Mahinda Rajapaksa by the late Kirivehera Soratha Thero in Kataragama. He stated that he was the only person with detailed knowledge about the house.",

Dr. Coomaraswamy emphasized the need for fiscal and external buffers to handle shocks in an increasingly uncertain global economy.He also stressed the importance of building up reserves and maintaining the gains achieved through recent reforms, such as the Public Finance Management Act and the Central Bank Act. \"We need to ensure that we secure these gains and achieve accelerated growth,\" he concluded.Deshamanya Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, former Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, praised the Central Bank's recent efforts in stabilizing the economy, describing it as one of the most impressive achievements in his fifty-year career.\"I have not come across such an impressive stabilization in my professional career. Bringing inflation down from 70 to about 3 is remarkable. This achievement is largely due to the reduction in electricity prices rather than demand-side pressures,\" Dr. Coomaraswamy stated.He commended the Central Bank Governor and his team for their swift and decisive actions, despite initial criticism. \"The aggressive measures taken were clearly the right thing to do,\" he added.",

        "date": "10-03-2025 | 5:51 PM",
        "content": "In Sri Lanka, multiple parties are currently urging the government to present the Batalanda Commission Report to Parliament and to implement its recommendations. This report, which investigates incidents that occurred during the 1988 90 period, has resurfaced in public discourse following former President Ranil Wickremesinghe's recent appearance on Al Jazeera's \"Head to Head\" program last Thursday 6, where he discussed related issues. What is the Batalanda Commission Report? In 1994, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was elected President of Sri Lanka, ending 17 years of United National Party UNP rule. One of her key election promises was to seek justice for the human rights violations, murders and disappearances that occurred during the 1988 90 period. Upon assuming office, President Kumaratunga established the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on September 21, 1995, to investigate these incidents. This commission, known as the Batalanda Commission, was tasked with examining the illegal detention, torture, assassination and disappearances of individuals at the Batalanda Housing Scheme, which was under the purview of the State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation. It was also tasked to identify those accountable, and make the necessary recommendations. The commission was chaired by then Court of Appeal Judge D. Jayawickrama, with High Court Judge N.E. Dissanayake serving as a member. A team of police officers was appointed to assist with the investigation, and the Attorney General's Department provided legal support, leading the evidence in the presence of the commission. Notable figures such as current Supreme Court Judge Yasantha Kodagoda and current President's Counsel Sarath Jayamanne were part of this legal team. The tenure of this Presidential Commission of Inquiry was extended on 12 separate occasions. After nearly three years of gathering evidence, the commission submitted its report to President Kumaratunga on March 26, 1998. What is Ranil Wickremesinghe's Connection To The Batalanda Commission? Ranil Wickremesinghe, was the Minister of Industries at the time. The Batalanda Housing Scheme, fell under the Ministry of Industries, and was allegedly used for illegal detentions and torture. The report revealed that houses within the scheme, specifically units A 2 2, A 2 1, A 2 3, A 1 7, B2, B1, and B7, were utilized by Wickremesinghe. The commission report also reported that a team of police officers led by then Peliyagoda Police Station Chief Douglas Peiris, were also given housing units. Additionally, 13 houses were allocated to officers of the Kelaniya Anti-Subversive Unit. One of the houses was reportedly used as Wickremesinghe's office, and the allocation of these houses was carried out under his directives. The commission summoned Wickremesinghe to testify and provide explanations regarding these allegations. After extensive investigations spanning across three years, the commission made several key recommendations, the most significant of which was to grant the Supreme Court the authority to revoke the civic rights of public representatives and police officers found guilty of severe human rights violations. The commission's report highlighted that the individual representing the executive branch repeatedly violated the law without fear of facing any consequences. What Happened to the Batalanda Report? Despite being submitted to the then-President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the recommendations of the Batalanda Commission Report were never implemented. When questioned by journalists at the time, Mangala Samaraweera, a prominent government figure, provided the following response: \"The President has refused to present the report, stating that she does not want to subject her main political opponent, or the Leader of the Opposition, to the same treatment that the United National Party UNP subjected Sirimavo Bandaranaike to. She has decided not to present it until her term ends. However, we hope to present the full report to the public after the elections.\" Although the Batalanda Commission Report has been a topic in election campaigns, it has yet to be presented for the sake of justice. FSP Demands Batalanda Report Be Tabled in Parliament Kumar Gunaratnam, General Secretary of the Frontline Socialist Party, has called for the Batalanda Commission Report to be officially tabled in Parliament. Gunaratnam emphasized that the report, which has not yet been presented to Parliament, allows Ranil Wickremesinghe to claim that it was never officially recognized by Chandrika Kumaratunga's government. Gunaratnam stressed the need for legal and political frameworks to ensure justice and prevent future occurrences of such incidents. He urged the current government to table the report in Parliament and take further steps to achieve justice. The Batalanda Commission Report highlights the promotion of Douglas Peiris to Assistant Superintendent of Police, bypassing 150 other candidates, claimed Gunaratnam adding that this promotion was facilitated by Ranil Wickremesinghe. He said that the report also implicates Wickremesinghe in the assassination of Vijayadasa Liyanarachchi, a popular speaker at the 1982 presidential election platform of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna JVP.",

        "content": "Former Inspector General of Police Deshabandu Tennakoon filed a writ petition in the Court of Appeal today 10, seeking an interim order to suspend the arrest order issued by the Matara Magistrate's Court. The petition was heard before the acting President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Mohamed Laffar Tahir, and Justice Sarath Disanayake. Representing Tennakoon, President's Counsel Dr. Romesh de Silva, instructed by Attorney-at-Law Sanath Wijewardena, made submission in court. Dr. de Silva argued that the arrest order issued by the Matara Magistrate's Court in connection with a shooting incident at a hotel in Weligama in 2023 was unlawful. He stated that the order was issued after a police officer died following the incident and after several pieces of evidence were recorded. Dr. Romesh de Silva further argued that, according to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, the Magistrate did not have the authority to issue such an order and requested the court to declare it null and void. The State Counsel, appearing on behalf of the Attorney General, stated that they had not received any instructions regarding the petition. Given the imminent threat of arrest, Dr. Romesh de Silva requested a short interim order to prevent Tennakoon's arrest. Justice Tahir, addressing the court, stated: \"Only this morning did I receive the case file related to this matter. I am not yet aware of the details contained in this petition. Therefore, I believe it is appropriate to verify the facts after issuing notices to the respondents.\" Dr. de Silva then requested the court to obtain an assurance from the respondents that Tennakoon would not be arrested. Justice Tahir responded: \"The petitioner has been free from trouble for about a week. He will remain so.\" The court then issued notices to the respondents and scheduled the petition for March 12 to verify the facts. On December 31, 2023, a shooting occurred in front of the W15 Hotel in Weligama, resulting in the death of a police officer attached to the Colombo Crime Division. The petitioner stated that the Weligama Police had conducted an investigation into the incident, which was later taken over to the Criminal Investigation Department CID. The petition emphasized that the investigation was influenced by the Secretary of the Ministry of Public Security, Ravi Seneviratne, and former CID Director Shani Abeysekara. Tennakoon's petition highlighted that the ongoing investigation was politically influenced, biased, and targeted against him. The petition also noted that the arrest order was issued without recording a statement from Tennakoon, which was unlawful. Tennakoon stated in his petition that he learned about the arrest order through the media. The respondents named in the petition include Matara Magistrate Aruna Buddhadasa, Acting Inspector General of Police Priyantha Weerasuriya, Minister of Public Security Ananda Wijepala, Secretary of the Ministry of Public Security Ravi Seneviratne, former CID Director Shani Abeysekara, and current CID Director P. Ampavila. Note: Quotes in this report are translations",

Survivors of torture identified the houses used for their mistreatment before the commission. These details are clearly documented in the commission's report. House 2 2 in the complex was used by Ranil Wickremesinghe from 1983 to April 1989 as a tourist bungalow under the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Employment. From April 1989 to 1994, Wickremesinghe used the same house as his official residence while serving as the Minister of Industries. House 2 1 was allocated for Wickremesinghe's security personnel, while House 2 3 was assigned to a ministry under his purview. Vincent Fernando, who served as Wickremesinghe's bungalow caretaker, mysteriously died a few days before Wickremesinghe was to testify before the commission. House 1 7 was also used by Wickremesinghe's security officers, and House B2 served as his office. A person who escaped torture identified this house before the commission, which was a significant revelation. House B1 was used by Wickremesinghe's security personnel, and Police Inspector Sudath Chandrasekara, Wickremesinghe's personal security officer, used House B7. House B8, located nearby, was used by the security personnel of Suprintendent Of Police Douglas Peiris. Earl Sugi Perera testified before the commission that he was tortured in House B8. The report also mentions that Wickremesinghe, as a minister, had ordered additional houses to be allocated to a police unit.

I was assigned to photograph the torture chambers and compile an album of all the individuals who were killed. This album was shown to suspects to identify the victims. The task assigned to me was to photograph individuals the day before they were killed. Some were consuming brnady as they enjoyed watching the cruel torture. Such people later became presidents of this country. The person who revealed everything about the Batalanda torture chamber committed suicide, but we know it wasn't a suicide. We know what happened when Douglas Peiris tried to cover things up. Wijeyadasa Liyanarachchi, who exited court, was taken to Tangalle, kept at the SSP's house, and then brought to Batalanda after being brutally tortured. Lawyers boycotted court and filed a habeas corpus petition, demanding his presentation in court. Ranil had to hospitalize Liyanarachchi, who died the same day. His post-mortem revealed 19 broken ribs and 307 injuries. Wijeyadasa Liyanarachchi, who fought for the poor, was brutally beaten and killed at the Batalanda torture chamber.\" The Batalanda report has resurfaced in public discourse following a recent interview with Al Jazeera, where Ranil Wickremesinghe was questioned about the report during the \"Head to Head\" program. Wickremesinghe repeatedly stated that the report was never presented to Parliament. Former BBC journalist Frances Harrison highlighted the report during the program.",

        "content": "There were three of the most popular female stars of their generation, alongside a powerhouse performer known for critically-acclaimed performances. Yet, all of them were beaten by a 17-year-old newcomer. At the prestigious IIFA Awards 2025, actor Nitanshi Goel's journey from debutant to best actress was nothing short of extraordinary. The actor, who made her debut in Kiran Rao's acclaimed film Laapataa Ladies, found herself overwhelmed with emotions as she accepted the award for her portrayal of Phool Kumari in the film. Veterans Boman Irani and Bobby Deol presented her with the award, and Nitanshi stunned attendees in a mesmerising ruby-red gown. However, it was her heartfelt acceptance speech that truly moved the audience. Overcome with emotions, Nitanshi almost choked on her tears, while thanking the film's team and her family. Nitanshi beat Alia Bhatt Jigra, Katrina Kaif Merry Christmas, Yami Gautam Article 370, and Shraddha Kapoor Stree 2 to bag her first major acting award. While speaking to ANI about the win, she said, \"I wasn't expecting this,\" adding, \"I was hoping Laapataa Ladies would win big, but I didn't think I would win myself. The other nominees were incredible, and I'm a huge fan of all of them. I'm truly overwhelmed by the love I've received.\" Asked about the emotional moment when she couldn't hold back tears, she revealed, \"It's become a thing now. Honestly, I couldn't stop crying because winning this award is a dream come true for every actor, and it's finally come true for me. I'm just so grateful.\" After receiving the honour, Nitanshi spoke about the overwhelming nature of the moment. \"The first thing I did was cry and try to put together a speech because I couldn't believe it was happening. Then I gave my mom a big hug, and a huge hug to Kiran ma'am. It was all just happy tears,\" she said. Looking to the future, Nitanshi expressed excitement about working with more stars. \"There are so many people on my list,\" she said, adding, \"But Shah Rukh sir tops the chart, followed by Kartik Aaryan. It would be amazing to work with any of them.\" Laapataa Ladies, released internationally as Lost Ladies, is a 2023 Hindi-language comedy-drama directed by Kiran Rao. It tells the story of two newlywed brides who are mistakenly exchanged during a train ride to their husbands' homes. The film, which also stars Pratibha Ranta, Sparsh Shrivastava, and Ravi Kishan, garnered praise for its compelling story and performances.",

        "content": "Dhananath Fernando, Chief Executive Officer of the Advocata Institute, has stressed on the urgent need for economic reforms to address Sri Lanka's economic position. Speaking on the country's economic challenges, Fernando emphasized that despite 76 years of independence, Sri Lanka remains a developing country due to poor financial management and unsustainable borrowing practices.\"The problem is very simple. We borrowed too much money in dollar terms, in short maturity, and invested in infrastructure which did not generate any revenue,\" he said.Fernando pointed out that a significant portion of the money borrowed since 2010 was used to pay interest and manage exchange rate variations, rather than generating revenue through productive investments. He noted that 50 of the borrowed funds were used for interest payments, while 26 accounted for exchange rate adjustments. This unsustainable borrowing has led to a situation where the country must pay approximately USD 1.2 billion annually for the next 20 years to service commercial debt alone.Highlighting the current budgetary constraints, Fernando explained that Sri Lanka's expenditure far exceeds its income, with a substantial portion of revenue being used to pay interest on debt. He stressed that the only viable solution for the country is to focus on economic growth. \"Growth is the only answer,\" he stated, emphasizing the need for comprehensive reforms to stimulate the economy.Fernando identified state-owned enterprise SOE reforms as a non-negotiable priority. He argued that the losses incurred by SOEs are diverting funds away from critical sectors such as education and healthcare. He cited the example of a single SOE absorbing USD 500 million in the previous year's budget, an amount equivalent to the entire allocation for the healthcare workforce in 2019.In addition to SOE reforms, Fernando called for improvements in trade and investment policies. He also highlighted the challenges posed by an aging population, which will increase pension expenditures and further strain the government's finances. He warned that Sri Lanka might face a second debt restructuring due to these compounded issues.Fernando stressed the importance of sound monetary policies and the need for a strong economic foundation to navigate the country's financial challenges.",

According to this section, a magistrate cannot issue such an order based solely on a report submitted by the police. No statement or record was taken from the petitioner before issuing this order.

If a guarantee is given that he will not be arrested, he is willing to cooperate with the investigations.\"Justice Mohammed Laffar raised another question:\"If the petitioner appears before the court, the magistrate will issue an appropriate order. So, he has the opportunity to appear before the court, doesn't he?\"Responding to this, the President's Counsel stated:\"Your Honor, if a guarantee is given that he will not be arrested, he is ready to appear.\"At this point, Additional Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris, appearing on behalf of the Attorney General, stated that such a guarantee cannot be given.Translation Of Excerpt:\"On the 27th, officers from the Criminal Investigation Department visited his residence at Gangani Mawatha, Hokandara, where he resides. He and his family members were not present. However, the house is under the protection of the Special Task Force and VIP security officers. The petitioner will be arrested based on a court order. This is not a decision made by the police; it is a court order.\"After considering the submissions, the Court of Appeal bench announced that the order on this petition will be issued on Monday, the 17th.",

        "date": "12-03-2025 | 4:47 PM",
        "content": "There is a memorial located in Buddhiyagama, in Weeraketiya, Tangalle, located in the south of Sri Lanka. This, buried under the sands of time, involves a person who was a focal point in the Batakanda Commission Report. He was Attorney-at-Law Wijeyadasa Liyanarachchi. A lawyer, human rights activist, and a skilled orator in the political arena. During the 88 89 period, he appeared in court without charging any fees on behalf of those who suffered various injustices due to human rights violations. On August 25, 1988, this lawyer disappeared. On September 2 of that year, he was admitted to the Colombo National Hospital and passed away at 12:55 AM the following day in the hospital's intensive care unit. \"During the post-mortem examination, it was revealed that he had 119 internal injuries and 20 external injuries due to severe torture. He had severe injuries on his left arm, several ribs were fractured, and there was a shoe mark on his right shoulder blade, which was well-documented in the medical examination,\" diclosed Chandradasa Liyanarachchi, the brother of the murdered Wijeyadasa Liyanarachchi. What happened to Attorney-at-Law Wijeyadasa Liyanarachchi? The Batalanda Commission Report contains about six pages of information regarding this death. According to the Commission Report, following the disappearance of Attorney-at-Law Wijeyadasa Liyanarachchi on August 25, 1988, his senior lawyer Ranjith Abeysuriya and others immediately intervened and made inquiries from various parties. According to the Batalanda Commission Report, when the then Inspector General of Police, inquired from Tangalle Police Superintendent Karavitage Dharmadasa about the matter, he was indirectly led to believe that the missing lawyer was in the custody of the Tangalle police. The then Inspector General of Police, Ernest Perera, testified before the commission that on August 31, 1988, at noon, the then Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe made a phone call to him. Wickremesinghe had stated that he expected the suspect, in this instance Wijeyadasa Liyanarachchi, to be brought to Colombo and handed over to the anti-subversive unit operating in the Kelaniya division. Accordingly, the then Inspector General of Police ordered for Wijeyadasa Liyanarachchi to be handed over to Assistant Superintendent of Police Douglas Peiris, who was residing in the Batalanda housing complex at the time. The Commission Report suspects that the lawyer was taken from Tangalle to the Batalanda torture chamber. Meanwhile, the Commission Report also focuses on the transfer of the lawyer to the Sapugaskanda police station after being handed over to the anti-subversive unit in Peliyagoda. Attorney-at-Law Liyanarachchi, who was handed over to the special unit, was admitted to the emergency unit of the Colombo National Hospital in a critical condition at 11 PM on September 2, 1988. He passed away in the intensive care unit at 12:55 AM. Excerpt from the Batalanda Commission Report: \"The post-mortem examination of the deceased was conducted by Colombo Judicial Medical Officer Dr. L.B. de Alwis. According to his findings, Wijeyadasa Liyanarachchi died due to multiple muscle and skeletal injuries caused by blunt weapons, leading to shock and bleeding.-- The post-mortem report states that there were 207 external injuries before death. This murder caused a great uproar at the time, and lawyers launched a strong campaign for justice. Amidst the strong public outcry, the then Tangalle Police Superintendent Karavitage Dharmadasa and two other officers were arrested and charged before a three-judge High Court bench. However, the High Court later acquitted them due to the inability to prove beyond reasonable doubt that they were the true murderers of Liyanarachchi. Excerpt from the Batakanda Commission Report: \"The Commission questions why Ranil Wickremesinghe intervened and why he instructed that Liyanarachchi be brought to Colombo and handed over to the special unit operating in the Kelaniya division. Wickremesinghe's stance before the Commission was that he never instructed the Inspector General of Police over the phone to act in such a manner. The Inspector General of Police informed him over the phone about the decision to transfer Liyanarachchi from Tangalle to Colombo and asked if he had any objections to detaining Liyanarachchi at Sapugaskanda. Wickremesinghe stated that he had no objections.\" However, the Commission strongly rejects Wickremesinghe's statement, as noted in the report. Excerpt from the Batakanda Commission Report: \"If the Minister of Industries was not actually controlling and directing the special unit operating in the Kelaniya area, why did the Inspector General of Police ask him if he had any objections to detaining Liyanarachchi at Sapugaskanda located within the electoral division represented by the Minister?\" \"Attorney-at-Law Wijeyadasa Liyanarachchi was my brother. All the conspiracies to murder him were carried out by the cruel politicians of the Hambantota Tangalle area in the south. He was a threat to them. As a lawyer and politician, the work he did for this country was a threat to those vile politicians. Wijeyadasa Liyanarachchi was a great challenge to the politicians of this district and the country's politics. This murder can be seen as a step taken to eliminate that challenge,\" said Chandradasa Liyanarachchi, the brother of the murdered Wijeyadasa Liyanarachchi.

        "content": "COLOMBO News 1st The Lithuanian Consulate to Sri Lanka has expressed deep concern over recent reports of fraudulent cryptocurrency advertisements circulating on social media platforms. These deceptive campaigns falsely feature Sri Lankan Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya and other prominent public figures, and are operated by foreign entities with the intent of misleading Sri Lankan citizens. These deceptive campaigns, identified by the Prime Minister s Office of Sri Lanka, are being operated by foreign entities with the intent of misleading Sri Lankan citizens, said the consulate adding that these fraudulent advertisements originate from accounts allegedly linked to Lithuania. This raises concerns about their transnational nature and the exploitation of digital platforms for financial scams. In response to these developments, the Lithuanian Consulate to Sri Lanka has taken immediate steps to address the issue: 1. Engaged with the Embassy of Lithuania to officially convey the concerns raised by Sri Lankan authorities and seek their guidance. 2. Requested formal clarification from relevant Lithuanian authorities regarding the alleged connections to fraudulent activities. 3. Communicated with Sri Lankan government agencies to express the Consulate s readiness to cooperate in any investigations. 4. Called for enhanced international cooperation between Sri Lankan and Lithuanian authorities to identify and mitigate the fraudulent activities. 5. Urged social media platforms, particularly Meta Facebook s parent company, to take stronger measures in preventing the spread of fraudulent advertisements. \"The Lithuanian Consulate to Sri Lanka strongly condemns any fraudulent activities that seek to exploit the trust of Sri Lankan citizens. Upon receiving reports of these deceptive cryptocurrency advertisements, we acted swiftly to bring the matter to the attention of the Lithuanian Embassy and relevant authorities. The Consulate remains fully committed to supporting efforts that protect Sri Lankan and Lithuanian interests and will continue to work towards enhanced collaboration between regulatory and enforcement agencies. We also urge digital platforms to take decisive action against fraudulent content to prevent further exploitation of their users,\" said Kanchana Kodituwakku, Director of the Lithuanian Consulate to Sri Lanka. The Lithuanian Consulate to Sri Lanka will continue to monitor developments and provide necessary updates in coordination with Sri Lankan and Lithuanian authorities. On Tuesday 11, Sri Lankan Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya strongly condemned the fraudulent cryptocurrency scam ads currently circulating on Facebook and Instagram, falsely using her name and image, along with those of other public figures in Sri Lanka. In a post of facebook, she said that these misleading advertisements, operated by foreign scam networks, aim to deceive the public and exploit trust. Despite requests for immediate action, some of these advertisements continue to appear, targeting Sri Lankan social media users. She stressed that NO government official, including herself, has endorsed any cryptocurrency investment scheme.",

        "content": "During a recent session of the parliamentary watchdog, the Committee On Public Enterprises or COPE several issues regarding the importation of medicines into the country outside the standard procurement process were revealed. This session saw officials from the National Medicines Regulatory Authority NMRA summoned to provide clarity on the matter.The COPE Chairman, Nishantha Samaraweera, raised concerns about the list in the W.O.R. Waiver Of Registration, questioning what had been removed and emphasizing the need for transparency. Dr. Ananda Wijewikrama, Chairman of the NMRA, acknowledged that the board paper included documents for review but lacked the purchase order and the applicant's technical documents. This omission raised significant concerns about the quality and other aspects of the imported medicines.Dr. Savin Semage, CEO of the NMRA, confirmed that there were no technical documents among the reviewed materials, further highlighting the lack of necessary details to ensure the quality of the medicines.Dr. Asela Gunawardena, Director General of Health Services, expressed his concerns about the transparency of the board meetings. He revealed that he did not attend the board meeting due to these concerns and later received a file regarding a special part, which he reviewed and recommended not to grant permission without the required documents.The COPE Chairman questioned the influence exerted by the ministry secretary, to which Dr. Pradeep Kumarasinghe de Silva responded by describing an unusual board meeting held at a hotel at the end of the year. He explained that the meeting was planned to coincide with a dinner for the NMRA staff, and an email was sent two days prior, informing them of the board meeting. During this meeting, a large number of drugs were approved for W.O.R. without proper discussion, which Dr. Kumarasinghe de Silva opposed.Further scrutiny revealed that an advance of Rs. 100,000 - was taken for the dinner and meeting, but the money was not spent and was returned to the account. Dr. Savin Semage clarified that such a meeting could not be held for Rs. 100,000 - and that the money was only to pay the members, not for food and hotel expenses. The Auditor General noted that if the money was returned, it meant no payment was made to the board members, indicating that it was not a valid board meeting and raising questions about the quorum.Professor Priyadarshini Galappatti highlighted that about 300 types of medicines were presented to the Medicine Review Committee at once with a waiver of registration list. The committee opposed this as none of the medicines were approved by the waiver of registration committee. It was revealed that some of these medicines were given to blacklisted companies, raising further concerns about the integrity of the importation process.The COPE committee's investigation has brought to light significant irregularities in the medicine importation process.",

        "date": "13-03-2025 | 4:11 PM",
        "content": "COLOMBO News 1st This is the story of Sub-Inspector Rohitha Priyadarshana. Rohitha Priyadarshana, who received his education at Nalanda College, Colombo, joined the Special Task Force of Sri Lanka Police in 1986. The Balanda Commission report has paid significant attention to him. Rohitha Priyadarshana, who also showed a natural talent for cricket, was assigned to the Crime Investigation Division of the Sapugaskanda Police Station under the Kelaniya Police Division in 1989. He successfully contributed to solving numerous thefts and other serious crimes within the Kelaniya Division. \"My brother was in charge of Sapugaskanda and Biyagama. The Balanda torture chamber was nearby. My brother investigated it and found out who was behind it,\" revealed Palitha Manuwarna, the brother of the late Rohitha Priyadarshana. What happened to Sub-Inspector Rohitha Priyadarshana? By 1990, Rohitha Priyadarshana was serving as the Officer-in-Charge of the Crime Investigation Division at the Sapugaskanda Police Station. On the afternoon of February 2, 1990, Police Inspector Keerthi Athapaththu, who was serving as the Officer-in-Charge of the Sapugaskanda Police Station, left for a meeting at the Biyagama Village Hotel. \"Keerthi Athapaththu went to the Biyagama Village Hotel that evening for a meeting, saying a minister was coming. Who was this minister? The minister of Biyagama was Ranil Wickremesinghe. Ranil Wickremesinghe and SP Douglas Peiris were said to be attending the meeting,\" Palitha Manuwarna, the brother of the late Rohitha Priyadarshana. Around 8 PM that day, a phone call was received at the police station. According to the testimony given to the Presidential Commission by Police Sergeant Siriwardhana, who was on duty at the time, the call was made by Officer-in-Charge Keerthi Athapaththu. The Officer-in-Charge had informed Rohitha Priyadarshana to come to the Biyagama Village Hotel. Following his superior's instructions, Rohitha left the police station, and a white car was parked in front of the station at that moment, as testified by Bandula Dinapurna, a journalist who was with Rohitha at the time. According to the Batalanda Commission repotrt, this was the last time anyone reported seeing Rohitha alive. Excerpt from the Batalanda Commission Report: \"Keerthi Athapaththu returned to the police station around 11 PM. He noted in the logbook that he was taking a break. However, he did not inquire about Priyadarshana's absence from the station.\" Three days later, a body believed to be that of the missing Rohitha Priyadarshana was found washed ashore on the banks of the Kelani River, opposite the Peliyagoda Police Station. The body was so badly decomposed that it was unrecognizable. However, Dinesh, Rohitha's brother, identified it based on a distinctive mark on Rohitha's body, as noted in the commission report. Excerpt from the Commission Report: \"A part of the face was missing. The limbs were injured. Dinesh could not recognize the face. The body was swollen. However, a distinctive feature on Priyadarshana's chest, two on each side, was visible.\" \"The Kelani River flows behind the Peliyagoda Police Station. At that time, my brother was wearing pants given by my elder brother. They used to exchange pants,\" revealed Palitha Manuwarna, the brother of the late Rohitha Priyadarshana. After the body was identified, the officers at the scene tied it to a nearby tree with a rope as it floated in the river. According to the commission report, this action by the police was deemed unusual. The next morning, Dinesh and his father went to the riverbank where the body was found, but it was no longer there, as noted in the commission report. Excerpt from the Commission Report: \"The rope used to tie the body to the tree was cut. The officers on duty at the Peliyagoda Police Station that night were unable to explain what happened to the body. Was Priyadarshana's body removed by an outsider without the consent of the Peliyagoda Police Station authorities? Or did the body float away to the sea after the rope was cut?\" Despite informing senior police officers on several occasions, Priyadarshana's family received no assistance, as noted in the commission report. The commission reached several conclusions regarding Priyadarshana's disappearance. Excerpt from the Commission Report: \"The fate that befell Priyadarshana is known only to those involved in his disappearance. They must live the rest of their lives with a painful conscience.\" \"This is a 35-year-old unresolved case. The President must ensure justice is served. We don't need another commission for my brother and the thousands who died. All facts have been confirmed by the Batalanda Commission. Ranil Wickremesinghe is directly involved and must be held accountable. His civic rights should be revoked, and he should face severe punishment,\" said the brother of the late Sub-Inspector.",

        "content": "Leader of the House, Minister Bimal Rathnayake, informed Parliament today 14 that the controversial Batalanda Commission report will be referred to the Attorney General for further legal action.He made these remarks while presenting the Batalanda Commission report to Parliament.Minister Bimal Rathnayake tabled the Batalanda Commission report following a comprehensive explanation of how the rulers who came to power in 1977 acted, leading to the unfortunate situation in the country during the 1980s.The massive violence against the Tamil people and political opponents in Sri Lanka in 1977.The enactment of draconian laws such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act in 1978, which implemented anti-democratic laws.The dismissal of 100,000 state employees who engaged in a labor struggle in 1980.The blatant rigging of the Development Council elections in Jaffna in 1981 and the burning of the Jaffna Library.The extension of parliamentary power for six years through a fraudulent referendum instead of holding parliamentary elections on time.The orchestration of a racial massacre against the Tamil people during the Black July of 1983 by ministers of the then United National Party government.The suppression of several leftist parties, including the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, using the same Black July.Minister Rathnayake explained how the youth of the country were subjected to oppression and repression due to the continuous anti-democratic and repressive practices of the government that came to power in 1977.He stated that the new government elected in 1994 aimed to bring justice for the repressive crimes that occurred over 17 years and that the public expected the Batalanda Commission to fulfill this task.\"On September 21, 1995, the Batalanda Commission was established by an order from then-President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga to investigate the establishment and operation of illegal detention centers and torture chambers at the Batalanda Housing Scheme. After several extensions, the final report was submitted on May 21, 1998, by the Commission's Secretary, G.K.J. Perera, to the Presidential Secretary. This letter confirms the submission,\" elaborated the Minister.'The final report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Batalanda, along with related documents and files, was handed over to the Director of the National Archives on May 20, 1998. Copies of the handover list and the form are attached for necessary action. G.K.J. Perera, Secretary, Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Batalanda,' the minister read out the letter to the house.\"Honorable Speaker, this report and the thousands of pages of evidence it is based on are largely composed of testimonies from individuals who endured immense suffering in these torture chambers. Despite the risk to their lives, they came forward to provide evidence while their tormentors held powerful positions, protected by their allies.Additionally, thousands of parents, siblings, and loved ones, including individuals like Manorani Saravanamuttu, who endured the pain of having their family members brutally abducted, tortured, and killed, came forward to testify before the Commission. They did so with the hope that justice would be served for their loved ones. I believe you will acknowledge that these individuals, despite their deep emotional scars, bravely relived their trauma to ensure that justice is served,\" said the Leader Of The House.Minister Bimal Rathnayake, Leader of the House, emphasized in Parliament that no legal action has been taken against the crimes revealed in the Batalanda Commission report, which was based on testimonies and evidence provided by the public during a period of severe repression.\"It is clear that the final report of the Batalanda Commission should have been handed over to then-President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga on May 22, 1998. However, despite a copy being sent to the National Archives, it is now evident why she did not forward a copy to the Attorney General at that time. Additionally, a letter dated March 16, 2000, from the Additional Secretary to the President, W.J.S. Karunaratne, to the Government Printer, instructed the printing of 500 Sinhala and 250 Tamil copies of the report for public release by March 27. Astonishingly, not one of these 750 printed copies was sent to the Attorney General.\"\"It is clear that those who called for this report neither punished the perpetrators nor implemented its significant recommendations but instead used it as a political tool during elections. The main accused recently stated on Al Jazeera that the report was never presented to Parliament. Thousands of men and women risked their lives, reliving their trauma to provide evidence to the Commission, hoping for justice for their loved ones who were brutally abducted, tortured, and killed. Despite the passage of 35 years since 1980, 30 years since the Commission was established, and 25 years since the report was released, my party and the Cabinet have entrusted me with the responsibility of presenting this report to Parliament and making it public,\" he added.Despite three decades having passed, Minister Bimal Rathnayake underscored the commitment to enforcing the law against the crimes revealed in the Batalanda Commission report.\"The tears of the generation that struggled and the immense suffering they endured cannot be fully captured by this 208-page report. Although this report represents only a fraction of the pain and suffering of the young people and their loved ones who were killed, I take this opportunity to thank all the officials of the Commission and everyone who contributed to compiling it as fairly as possible.\"\"For thirty-five years, those who committed crimes against the public have managed to evade justice, using their power and wealth to suppress the people. However, on September 21, 2024, the report that had been hidden in the dark archives of the Presidential Secretariat for twenty-five years finally saw the light of day. Today, I present this report to Parliament, bearing the heavy burden of the suffering and struggles of generations, including my comrade Wijayadasa Srinath, who sacrificed their lives for the dream of a just society.\"\"As Túpac Amaru II, the leader of the anti-imperialist national liberation movement in the Andes region of South America, declared before his executioners, 'I will return, and I will be millions.' Similarly, the millions of Sri Lankans who have united to continue the struggle initiated by our past generations have achieved the first victory in this battle. Thus, I am able to present this report, to the people and the world.\" The government and the cabinet have reached a policy decision to act on the Batalanda Commission report to ensure that such a barbaric period never takes place again. The report will be directed to the Attorney General, and President Anura Kumara Dissanayake will appoint a special committee to provide advice and proposals on future actions regarding the report.The government also plans to engage in a two-day debate on the report at an appropriate time. Additionally, the Batalanda Commission report will be made available in Sinhala, Tamil, and English, and printed copies will be provided for the perusal of members of Parliament and the public.There are 28 evidence volumes related to the commission, which will be produced in Parliament in due course, revealed the Leader Of The House.The report, which investigates events from the 1988 to 1990 period, has sparked renewed discussion following comments made by former President Ranil Wickremesinghe during a recent interview on Al Jazeera's \"Head to Head.\"",

He was surrendered to the custody of the ICC on 12 March 2025.Duterte is suspected of murder qualified as a crime against humanity, allegedly committed in the Philippines between 1 November 2011 and 16 March 2019. During this time, Duterte was, at varying times, the President of the Philippines, the Mayor of Davao City, and, allegedly, the head of the Davao Death Squad, said the International Criminal Court.During the initial appearance hearing, the judges will verify the identity of the suspect and the language in which he is able to follow the proceedings. He will be informed of the charges against him and of his rights under the ICC Rome Statute. Pre-Trial Chamber I is composed of Judge Iulia Antoanella Motoc Presiding judge and Judges Reine Adélaïde Sophie Alapini-Gansou and María del Socorro Flores Liera.Duterte stands accused of the crime against humanity of murder over his years-long campaign against drug users and dealers that rights groups said killed as many as 30,000 people.The 79-year-old former leader was turned over by the Philippines to The Hague-based court on Wednesday, becoming the first-ever Asian leader to be charged before the international tribunal.As he landed in the Netherlands on Wednesday, the former leader appeared to accept responsibility for his actions, saying in a Facebook video: I have been telling the police, the military, that it was my job and I am responsible. Duterte s swift arrest in Manila and turnover to the ICC came amid a spectacular meltdown in relations between his family and the Marcos family, who had joined forces in the Philippines presidential elections in 2022 and won in a landslide.Current President Ferdinand Marcos and Vice President Sara Duterte Rodrigo s daughter are at loggerheads, with the latter facing an impeachment trial over charges, including an alleged assassination plot against Marcos.Sara Duterte is in the Netherlands to support her father, after labelling his arrest oppression and persecution.",

This trail, the country's first long-distance walking path, connects thousands of colonial-era dirt roads and railway tracks constructed by the British.While local companies have offered trekking tours along parts of the route for years, this marks the first time all 22 sections have been unified into a single trail.The initiative was led by Sri Lanka-based sustainability consultant Miguel Cunat and funded by the European Union and the U.S. Agency for International Development.For hikers, the Pekoe Trail provides an intimate exploration of Sri Lanka's diverse landscapes and rich tea history. The trail begins in the misty Hanthana mountains near Kandy, winding through tea plantations, eucalyptus forests, quaint villages, and the sacred peak of Sri Pada, before reaching Nuwara Eliya, the heart of Sri Lanka's tea industry.A newly launched app enhances the hiking experience by highlighting nearby landmarks, providing segment details, emergency information, and more. Each stage of the trail takes approximately three to six hours to hike, depending on its difficulty, and completing the entire route can take several weeks.",

        "content": "\"Two men with pistols shot my husband at the Kalagedihena junction, dragged him by the neck, and put him into a white Hi-Ace van without license plates. Witnesses at the junction saw this.\"This is the sorrow of a wife whose husband, a former government employee who lived his life singing viridu, disappeared.This state employee, a father of three, is none other than Ananda Jayakody, a lawyer who survived brutal torture at the Batalanda torture chamber but is still alive, possibly due to his past merits.What happened to Ananda Jayakody?According to his wife, M. Premawathi, as stated in newspapers at the time, Ananda Jayakody left his house on September 6, 1988, to meet then-MP S.D. Bandaranaike.However, Ananda Jayakody was abducted at the Kalagedihena junction after leaving his house.\"They put me in a van after shooting me. They shot me in both legs. They put me in a van and blindfolded me. While in the van, I was tied up, and my face held to the floor of the van. From one corner of the van, I could barely see through my blindfold that it was a residential complex. Then I realized this was Batalanda. They dragged me out and took me away. Although three or four people came from behind, two held my arms from both sides. As we walked, I heard the sound of people being tortured in the rooms of that residential complex,\" recalled Ananda Jayakody.In the 1980s, Ananda Jayakody was involved with the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna JVP as an activist and became famous as a viridu singer.He gained significant fame for his contribution as a viridu singer during a strike in 1986.In 1988, amidst the backdrop of JVP being banned as an organization, Ananda Jayakody participated in discussions to present a common candidate for the presidential election representing JVP.\"The Mahajana Eksath Peramuna led by Dinesh Gunawardena and several parties including Rukman Senanayake of the United Lanka People's Party and Dr. Gamini Wijesekera participated in this discussion. I went with a letter signed by Rohana Wijeweera and Gamini Gunasekara representing JVP. That s when it was revealed that I was Ananda Jayakody. Therefore, they abducted me to kill me,\" he said.Ananda Jayakody's disappearance drew significant attention due to another victim of Batalanda torture chamber, Attorney-at-Law Wijayadasa Liyanarachchi's burial incident on that day.Ananda Jayakody is still alive today because his abduction was revealed in Parliament at that time.Then-MP S.D. Bandaranaike raised Ananda Jayakody's disappearance in Parliament, which is recorded in Hansard to this day.Excerpt from Hansard\"\"Ananda Jayakody was taken into custody at Kalagedihena junction at 7:30 this morning. He helped me draft peace proposals. Honorable Minister, if you can look into why he was taken into custody, it would be significant. What he did was sing viridu on buses. He was taken from Kalagedihena junction.\"End of Hansard excerpt.\"On the day I was abducted, S.D. Bandaranaike was in Parliament. After being shot and abducted, Bandaranaike revealed this in Parliament which prevented them from killing me,\" disclosed Ananda.Even today, despite his reluctance, Ananda Jayakody reveals these dark memories emphasizing that recommendations from the Batalanda Commission report must be implemented.\"Someone asked who I was and they then said I am Ananda Jayakody. That individual said that I was a wanted person and and they took me inside to a room where they first applied Dharma Chakra torture method. In this method, my limbs are boubd. They make me bleed from one leg, and place a iron rod. Then they tied me to either side, and started spinning the wheel. When the first round was done, someone said that something had gone wrong, and demanded that I be brought down. Afterward, I was put inside a van. After traveling a distance, I was taken to a room and then my blindfold was opened. It was then that I realised that I was in a torture chamber, at a house belonging to the Gampaha Police. They tortured in many ways,\" he recalled. Many such murders buried under sands of time are included in Batalanda Commission report.Living witnesses who suffered brutal torture at Batalanda still raise their voices demanding justice according to Commission's recommendations.\"If not for Parliament revealing my abduction I wouldn't be alive today. Murders did take place. That brutal regime killed thousands of people. Ranil Wickremesinghe was the torturer of Batalanda, \" shared Ananda.Truth can never be suppressed.",

        "content": "In Parliament on Saturday 15, Leader of the House Minister Bimal Rathnayake revealed that former President Ranil Wickremesinghe hired a butler during his private trip to the United Kingdom in September 2023. According to Rathnayake, the butler was paid 1,000 a day for his services during the trip.The trip, which took place on the 22nd and 23rd of September 2023, was initially planned as a private visit. Wickremesinghe traveled to Wolverhampton and London with a delegation of 10, which included his wife, Senaratne Dissanayake, Sandra Perera, a doctor, security personnel, and an advanced security team. The funds for the trip were requested from the London High Commission on August 16, 2023, under \"most urgent\" and \"strictly confidential\" terms.While the trip was initially deemed a private one, the costs associated with it ballooned to around 40,000 approximately Rs. 16.2 million. The trip's description was later amended, and it was reclassified as an official program. This raised questions about how a private trip could turn into an official one and how the substantial expenses were justified.Minister Rathnayake raised serious concerns about the spending of taxpayer money, noting that 2,000 was paid specifically for the butler's services, with bills to back up these claims. He also mentioned that a statement regarding Batalanda would be made the following day, which he believed would shed light on the matter further.The Minister called for a thorough investigation by officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including the Minister, into the costs and spending on this trip. He also questioned the ethics behind using taxpayer money for a private trip, especially when the country was facing financial challenges.

        "content": "Douglas Peiris, one of the individuals who received housing in the Batalaanda housing complex, has gained significant attention in the Batalanda Commission Report.Who is Douglas Peiris?Douglas Peiris joined the police force in 1967 as a probationary police constable and was promoted to sub-inspector in 1971.He was then promoted to police inspector in 1979, and to chief police inspector in 1985, serving as the officer-in-charge of the Peliyagoda Police Station.On July 20, 1987, Peiris was promoted to Assistant Superintendent of Police. At that time, his primary responsibility was to oversee the activities of the Kelaniya Anti-Subversive Operations Unit.His rapid promotions raised concerns and attracted significant attention from the commission.Excerpt from the Batalanda Commission Report\"To be confirmed in the position of Assistant Superintendent of Police, one must sit for and pass the prescribed examination within three years. Douglas Peiris sat for the relevant examination. However, he was unable to pass.\"End of Excerpt.Douglas Peiris's promotion to Assistant Superintendent of Police was recommended by Senior Superintendent of Police Nalin Delgoda, in a letter to Deputy Inspector General of Police M.R. Gunaratne.According to the commission's report, this recommendation was made at the request of Douglas Peiris himself.Excerpt from the Batalanda Commission Report\"Delgoda did not explain in his letter how such a promotion could be made, despite Peiris not being confirmed in the position of Assistant Superintendent of Police. Delgoda justified his recommendation by providing a list of the work done by Peiris during the subversive rebellion.\"End of Excerpt.The commission paid close attention to the work Peiris had done during that period.A letter from Senior Superintendent Nalin Delgoda to the commission stated that Peiris had taken necessary actions to prevent the advancement of the subversive movement and eliminate subversive individuals.The commission sought clarification on the meaning of the word \"eliminate\" used in the letter.Excerpt from the Batalanda Commission Report\"Delgoda described the word 'eliminate' as referring to 'justified homicides' committed by Assistant Superintendent Peiris. However, Delgoda failed to explain how committing justified homicides could qualify as a basis for promotion.\"End of Excerpt.This raised concerns regarding Douglas Peiris's continued promotions.The commission later revealed that \"eliminate\" referred to extrajudicial killings of subversives. The then Inspector General of Police, Ernest Edward Perera, confirmed this during his testimony before the commission.According to the report, the main reason for Peiris's promotion was his role in halting the subversive movement's progress through extrajudicial killings.Excerpt from the Batalanda Commission Report\"Due to the series of promotions received by Douglas Peiris, he suddenly surpassed 130 senior gazetted police officers. No other police officer in history has received such a promotion. It was the longest leap ever made in the police service.\"End of Excerpt.The report further states that Peiris's duties were suspended in 1995 following investigations into serious alleged offenses committed by him.Why did Douglas Peiris suddenly disappear?What was his request to the Swiss authorities?What was in the affidavit submitted by Douglas to the commission?All will be revealed tomorrow.The truth can never be suppressed.",

The Commission report also mentions that because of this, Nalin Delgoda and others were indirectly responsible.However, Ranil Wickremesinghe clarified that none of the other facts mentioned in the Commission report are relevant to him. He pointed out that the report includes observations about acts of terrorism committed by the JVP between 1988 and 1990, as well as the background of these incidents. Chapter three of the report speaks at length about the terrorism perpetrated by the JVP, detailing past incidents.Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that apart from these points, none of the other accusations were relevant to him. He completely rejected the report.He also added that no political party that came into power has attempted to use this report for political gain. He said that there is no tradition of debating a report that was on the agenda of parliament 25 years ago, stating that such a precedent is not seen in Sri Lanka or anywhere in the world.",

        "date": "16-03-2025 | 3:25 PM",
        "content": "Assistant Superintendent of Police Douglas Peiris.Yesterday, News 1st revealed how Douglas Peiris, who joined the police force in 1967 as a probationary constable, rapidly received promotions within the police service.This information was based on excerpts from the Batalanda Commission report.A significant point revealed before the Commission was that Douglas Peiris was rapidly promoted due to his qualification of \"eliminate\" subversive individuals.The Commission later discovered that the term \"eliminate\" subversive individuals referred to \"extrajudicial killings\".In 1995, Douglas Peiris was suspended from his duties due to investigations into serious offenses allegedly committed by him.During the Commission's investigations, he suddenly disappeared and stopped appearing before the Commission.According to the Commission's report, since Douglas Peiris was not obligated to continuously appear before the Commission, no investigation was pursued into his disappearance.However, it was later revealed that Douglas Peiris had secretly left the country.Excerpt from the Batalanda Commission Report:\"Investigations by the Criminal Investigation Department revealed that Douglas Peiris had left the country on July 20, 1996. Before leaving, Peiris obtained a fake passport under the false pretext that he was using the name 'Talpawila Vidana Kankanange Wimalasena.' The address he provided to obtain this passport was No. 37, Kandy Road, Peiris Mawatha, Kelaniya.\"End of Excerpt.According to the Commission's report, no one has been able to prove how Douglas Peiris left Sri Lanka.However, information obtained from Interpol revealed that he had traveled by air from Bombay on July 22, 1996, on flight TG 970, about a year after his suspension.Excerpt from the Batalanda Commission Report:\"He arrived in Bangkok on the same day on flight TG 970. Subsequently, on August 9, Peiris traveled to Switzerland.\"End of Excerpt.Why did Douglas Peiris go to Switzerland?Douglas Peiris, who went to Zurich, Switzerland, requested political asylum.The Commission's report states that Swiss authorities granted him temporary permission to stay while his application for political asylum was being considered.Excerpt from the Batalanda Commission Report:\"The main reason Douglas Peiris gave for seeking political asylum was that he would be subjected to persecution if he returned to Sri Lanka. The Swiss authorities decided not to accept Douglas Peiris's reasons and refused to grant him political asylum. They were not satisfied with the reasons given by Peiris.\"End of Excerpt.Under Swiss law, Douglas Peiris was given until January 31, 1997, to file an appeal against the rejection order.Surprisingly, he disappeared again during this time.According to the Commission's report, from that moment on, the Commission received no further information about Douglas Peiris's whereabouts.Excerpt from the Batalanda Commission Report:\"However, his lawyer, Nalin Ladduwahetti, occasionally requested copies of the Commission's proceedings and documents submitted to the Commission. These requests were granted, and the necessary records were released to the lawyer.\"End of Excerpt.Meanwhile, the Commission received a document purportedly sent by Douglas Peiris on August 14, 1996.The Commission's report states that the document was similar to an affidavit.The Commission's first concern was to verify the authenticity of this document.Excerpt from the Batalanda Commission Report:\"To determine the authenticity of this document, an investigation was conducted to ascertain whether the Justice of the Peace who allegedly certified the document had actually done so. The investigation revealed that the Justice of the Peace mentioned in the document had not certified it. Therefore, the contents of the document were not considered.\"End of Excerpt.Douglas Peiris's name is frequently mentioned among the Commission's decisions in Chapter 9 of the Batalanda Commission report.His name is at the top of the list of those who obtained houses in the Batalanda housing complex in violation of police department regulations.The Commission's report clearly states that some houses in the Batalanda housing scheme were used to illegally detain and torture individuals between January 1, 1988, and December 31, 1990.During that period, Douglas Peiris used houses in the Batalanda housing complex, and some houses were also used by Douglas Peiris's security officers.Another important point in the Commission's decisions is that Assistant Superintendent of Police Douglas Peiris is at the top of the list of police officers directly responsible for the illegal detention and torture of individuals in the houses of the Batalanda housing complex during that period.The truth can never be suppressed.",

A debate is also ongoing in Parliament,\" said Silva.\"Recently, Ranil Wickremesinghe made a statement but did not deny the allegations against him. Additionally, many people, including those who suffered torture and even some police officers, are ready to provide evidence about the events at Batalanda. This is something that will proceed according to the law. The government will not change this for any reason. There are two types of criticism: some say this is an attempt to sling mud and seek revenge, while others believe that Ranil will not be punished and nothing will come of it. Regardless of what anyone says, we will act according to the law. We are not here to sling mud or seek revenge, but to ensure that the law is enforced. Legal action based on the Batalanda report will be taken in the future, he added.",

These crimes include sexual harassment, sexual exploitation of children, rape, prostitution, unnatural offenses, and gross indecency.The police highlighted that publishing or broadcasting any details related to ongoing court cases without court approval is a violation of the law. Additionally, Section 20 of the Assistance to and. Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act, No. 10 of. 2023 prohibits the public disclosure of the identities of victims, witnesses, and informants.The statement further warns that exceeding legal boundaries in reporting on crime investigations and victims can lead to adverse consequences for the victims. Media organizations could face legal action if their reporting causes harm to the victims.The police also noted that disclosing the identities of victims can lead to their harassment and threats, while publishing photos of suspects without police approval can hinder identification parades.

The CID revealed that the officers opened fire at the hotel.Subsequently, officers from the Weligama Police and the Special Task Force arrived at the scene, and has opened fire at the fleeing Colombo Crime Division officers' van.The van fled towards the Imaduwa entrance of the Expressway, where the police eventually apprehended them.One of the main allegations against suspended IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon was that he had sent Colombo Crime Division officers to the Southern Province for personal reasons.Investigations later accused Tennakoon of maintaining an unofficial armed squad.On February 28, Matara Magistrate Aruna Buddhadasa ordered the arrest of Tennakoon and eight others based on the CID's findings.Following further submissions by the CID, the Magistrate Court issued an open warrant for Tennakoon's arrest.On March 7, Tennakoon filed a writ petition with the Court of Appeal, seeking an interim order to suspend the Matara Magistrate Court's directive.The petition was heard today 17 before Acting President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Mohammed Laffar Tahir, and Justice Sarath Disanayake.President's Counsel Romesh de Silva, representing Tennakoon, submitted a motion stating that he received the complete case file from the Matara Magistrate Court last Friday.He requested more time to present further arguments, which was strongly opposed by Additional Solicitor General Dilip Peiris, representing the Attorney General.Peiris pointed out that both parties had presented their arguments for over two hours on March 12, and the court had set today for the order.He argued that submitting a motion at this stage was unjustifiable.Meanwhile, the Court of Appeal took note of a statement issued by the Police Media Division yesterday 16.The statement mentioned that six officers from the Colombo Crime Division, including the then-Officer-in-Charge, would not be arrested until the investigation concluded, as agreed upon by both parties' lawyers.Additional Solicitor General Peiris highlighted that this agreement had been in place for nearly three months and questioned the sudden issuance of the statement yesterday, suspecting it was intended to influence today's court order.Acting President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Tahir, clarified that his court had not issued such an order.After considering the arguments, the panel dismissed Tennakoon's motion and announced its decision.Justice Tahir emphasized that Tennakoon was not an ordinary citizen but the country's IGP.He noted that it was a serious offense for a senior police officer to evade the court for 18 days.Justice Tahir stated that Tennakoon's actions undermined the rule of law, which he was responsible for upholding, and that such conduct was unacceptable.",

While in the toilet, he looked out through a small window and realized he was in a house within the Batalanda Housing Scheme.Sydney testified before the Batalanda Commission that other individuals were also tortured in that house.He witnessed two people being hung by their legs inside the house, with blood streaming from their bodies.On some days, he was forced to wear women's clothes and a wig, as revealed in his testimony before the Batalanda Commission.After being held for several days, Assistant Superintendent of Police Douglas Peiris visited the house and also assaulted him, according to Sydney's statement.After 22 days, he was taken outside in a jeep driven by Douglas Peiris.During the journey, Assistant Superintendent of Police Douglas Peiris told Sydney, \"When you go home, you must fulfill a duty for a certain gentleman. If you don't, you will be killed.\" When Sydney asked what the duty was, Peiris replied, \"Your family members will know.\"Sydney Perera learned the full extent of this ordeal only after returning home.After Sydney was abducted, his father went to the Peliyagoda Police, but finding no help there, he approached the then-Inspector General of Police, Ernest Perera, leveraging their distant kinship.The police headquarters contacted Douglas Peiris, who requested a photograph of Sydney Perera.A few days later, Douglas Peiris informed Sydney's father that such a person was not at that location.However, after Sydney's father mentioned that there were rumors in town that Sergeant Ratnayake had abducted his son, Douglas Peiris became angry, returned the photograph, and told him to leave.A few days later, an unknown person approached Sydney's father with a note stating, \"You will find your son. Go and meet this gentleman.\"The note mentioned the name of Attorney-at-Law Lakshman Ranasinghe.Later identified as the Chairman of the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation, he demanded Rs. 50,000 for Sydney Perera's release.He provided an address in Kollupitiya for the money handover.However, before the money was handed over, Sydney was released under the threat of fulfilling a duty.Earl Sugi Perera later met Attorney-at-Law Lakshman Ranasinghe, expressed his gratitude, and promised to pay the requested amount later.The then-Inspector General of Police, Ernest Perera, also confirmed this incident before the commission.The house where Earl Sugi Perera was held was later identified before the commission as House B-8 in the Batalanda Housing Complex. The adjacent house was occupied by Ranil Wickremesinghe's personal security officer, Sudath Chandrasekara.House B-8 was allocated for the security officers of Douglas Peiris.Was Earl Sugi Perera abducted for anti-riot operations?Or was it to extort money under the threat of death?Should this era of crime be buried in the sands of time?Shouldn't justice be served?",

        "content": "A writ petition filed by Sri Lanka's national cricket captains, Charith Asalanka and Dhananjaya De Silva, was taken up for support before the Court of Appeal today. The petition challenges the Inland Revenue Department's arbitrary classification of national cricketers as employees of Sri Lanka Cricket SLC.The petitioners, representing the One Day International and Twenty20 cricket teams and the Test Cricket Team, sought to quash the Inland Revenue Department's decision and requested an interim order to suspend it. The petition was supported by a letter signed by 38 national cricketers, including Wanindu Hasaranga, Angelo Mathews, Maheesh Theekshana, Pathum Nissanka, and Kusal Mendis, outlining their grievances and endorsing the petitioners' legal action.The petitioners argued that Sri Lanka's cricketers have historically been treated as independent service providers, not employees. They emphasized that the contracts between SLC and the players have always reflected this status. The court's attention was drawn to the uncertainty involved in cricketers' career progression and the nature of their contracts, which involve fees rather than salaries.The petitioners also highlighted that the contracts facilitate the use of players' image rights, essential for broadcasting matches and global cricket events. They argued that the Inland Revenue Department's decision, made without giving the cricketers a hearing, was unreasonable and arbitrary.The court was informed that the change in classification has created uncertainty for the cricketers regarding their contracts and statutory entitlements. The petitioners clarified that they were not seeking to avoid paying taxes, as they have been paying through self-assessment, and that the Auditor General has recognized them as independent service providers.Sri Lanka Cricket SLC supported the petitioners' position, agreeing that the cricketers are independent service providers. The court scheduled the matter to resume on March 28, 2025, for further submissions.",

During today's 18 press conference to announce cabinet decisions, questions were raised regarding the non-arrest of Deshabandu Tennakoon, despite an open warrant issued against him.He assured that the government is making efforts to arrest him and emphasized that the court's decision to suspend Tennakoon's duties as Inspector General of Police is not an interdiction.Dr. Jayatissa reaffirmed the government's commitment to applying the law fairly and equally to everyone, highlighting the significance of the Court of Appeal's decision, which allows for legal action against those providing protection to Tennakoon.When asked if the delay in arresting Tennakoon was due to some deal, Dr. Jayatissa denied such claims. He explained that several individuals, including Prasanna Ranaweera and Sewwandi the suspect wanted in connection with the assassination of Ganemulla Sanjeewa, are also being searched for by police teams. He assured that the police are making maximum efforts in this regard and that the suspects cannot escape.",

        "content": "Former Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe responded to the comments made regarding the controversial Batalanda Commission Report, a topic that resurfaced following his appearance on Al Jazeera's Head to Head program. According to Wickremesinghe, the primary reason for providing housing in the Batalanda housing complex to police officers was the attack on the Sapugaskanda Police Station. \"During this period of terror, the Sapugaskanda Police Station was attacked, and the Office-in-Charge was killed. At that time, Deputy Minister of Defense Ranjan Wijayaratne contacted me and requested that the vacant houses in the housing complex be provided for the security of military and police officers. Accordingly, the then Commissioner took steps to hand over the houses to Nalin Delgoda of the Kelani Police Division,\" said Wickremesinghe on 16th March. The Batalanda Commission Report revealed several details about this attack, that was mentioned by the Former President. On July 17, 1989, at 2:55 AM, an explosion occurred on the upper floor of the Sapugaskanda Police Station. Simultaneously, gunfire was directed at the building from the south side, and several individuals entered the police station by jumping over the wall. The then Officer-in-Charge, Lalith Mahanama, and his team retaliated, but one of the attackers entered the OIC's room and shot him dead. The attackers retreated and fled due to the police and military counterattacks. At that time, Rohitha Priyadarshana, the Officer-in-Charge of the Crimes Division, who was away on duty, arrived at the police station with his team and launched a counterattack. Three police officers, including the Officer-in-Charge, were killed in the attack, and two armed attackers also died. Investigations into the two deceased armed men who attacked the Police Station, revealed interesting details about the attack. One of them was identified as Sumith Perera, alias Kaluwa, whose father was Gonawala Piyadasa Perera. Piyadasa had seven brothers, including Sam, Harold, Vincent, Cyril, Shelton, Tudor, and Sunil Perera, also known as the notorious Gonawala Sunil. The Batalanda Commission Report includes a special note on Gonawala Sunil, the uncle of Sumith, who died in the attack on the Sapugaskanda Police Station. \"It is well known that Gonawala Sunil was an active supporter of the United National Party UNP. He was also the uncle of Sumith Perera, known as Kaluwa. According to Ranil Wickremesinghe, Gonawala Sunil was his active supporter and served as a regional leader of the UNP. Sunil had a close relationship with Wickremesinghe and frequently invited him to parties at his house. It was customary for Sunil to go to Katunayake Airport to welcome Wickremesinghe upon his return to Sri Lanka. Wickremesinghe acknowledged this when shown a photograph of him with Sunil and others at the airport.\" The Batalanda Commission Report also mentions the connection between Gonawala Sunil and the Batalanda torture chamber. \"According to Vincent Perera, the caretaker of the tourist bungalow where Wickremesinghe resided, Gonawala Sunil frequently visited the bungalow while Wickremesinghe was living there.\" The Batalanda Commission report states that Gonawala Sunil was pardoned by the government while serving a sentence for abusing the daughter of an individual identified as Dr. Paul. Despite numerous criminal charges, he was appointed as a Justice Of The peace, affecting the entire country. The Batalanda Commission found no evidence that Gonawala Sunil or his family members were affiliated with any political party other than the UNP. Shelton Perera, another uncle of Sumith Perera and brother of Gonawala Sunil, was also arrested in connection with the attack on the Sapugaskanda Police Station. Shelton's wife brought this to Wickremesinghe's attention, and Shelton was promptly released from custody, as reported by the Batalanda Commission. Wickremesinghe attempted to justify the provision of housing to police officers in the Batalanda housing complex due to the attack on the Sapugaskanda Police Station. However, the commission report indicated that no thorough investigation or effort to uncover the truth about the attack was made. The report noted that suspects were either released or escaped, with no further action taken. At the time of the attack, Rohitha Priyadarshana was the OIC of the Crime Division. He was a skilled crime investigator who closely monitored the crimes committed by Gonawala Sunil's family. On February 8, 1990, Tudor Perera, a brother of Gonawala Sunil, was abducted by Rohitha and his team, according to a complaint made by Tudor's wife to Wickremesinghe. Rohitha Priyadarshana was suspended on February 20 and is believed to have been murdered. Are these crimes to be hidden? Should justice not be served?",

The Supreme Court ordered the government to pay her Rs. 100,000 in compensation for the violation of her fundamental rights. The ruling was made in response to a fundamental rights petition filed by Kanchana Priyadarshani Madurapperuma, a resident of Henagama, Pokunuwita, who was arrested by the Peliyagoda Special Investigation Unit. The judgment was delivered by a bench of Supreme Court judges, including Dilip Nawaz and Mahinda Samayawardhana, with Justice S. Thurairaja presiding.

        "content": "Israeli airstrikes pounded Gaza, killing more than 400 people, Palestinian health authorities said on Tuesday 18, threatening the complete collapse of a two-month ceasefire as Israel vowed to use more force to free hostages held by Hamas. The Palestinian militant group, which still holds 59 of the 250 or so hostages seized in its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, accused Israel of breaching the ceasefire and jeopardising efforts by mediators to secure a permanent truce. Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he had told the military to take \"strong action\" against Hamas in response to the group's refusal to release the remaining hostages and because of their rejection of ceasefire proposals. Egypt, one of the mediators in the ceasefire deal agreed in January, called for restraint and urged all parties to work towards a lasting agreement. Airstrikes hit houses and tent encampments from the north to south of the Gaza Strip and Israeli tanks shelled across the border line into the east and south of the enclave. \"It was a night of hell. It felt like the first days of the war,\" said Rabiha Jamal, 65, a mother of five from Gaza City. \"We were preparing to have something to eat before starting a new day of fasting when the building shook and explosions began. We thought it was over but war is back,\" she told Reuters via a chat app. In hospitals strained by 15 months of bombardment, piles of bodies in white plastic sheets smeared with blood could be seen stacked up as casualties were brought in. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 404 people had been killed, many of them children, and 562 people were injured. The Israeli military said it hit dozens of targets, and that the attacks would continue for as long as necessary and extend beyond airstrikes, raising the prospect that Israeli ground troops could resume fighting.",

He highlighted the dominance of dairy exports in trade statistics and expressed New Zealand's interest in helping Sri Lanka develop its own dairy industry. He pointed out that dairy farming typically starts as small family-run operations and can naturally grow into larger farm businesses. Pine believes Sri Lanka is well-positioned for this progression due to its relatively lower proportion of the population in agriculture and higher productivity compared to neighboring countries.New Zealand aims to assist Sri Lanka in capacity building, food safety, and meeting export regulations, with potential extending beyond dairy to fruit production. Pine identified the lack of people-to-people contact as the biggest obstacle to stronger economic relations. He noted that while there is no negative sentiment towards Sri Lanka in New Zealand, awareness is low. To address this, New Zealand plans to focus on tourism, aiming to attract 50,000 New Zealanders to Sri Lanka annually.",

Peiris argued that Tennakoon is a notorious organized criminal, second only to figures like Makandure Madush and Harak Kata.Suspended Inspector General of Police IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon, who was ordered to be arrested on sight, appeared before the Matara Magistrate's Court this morning at approximately 7:30 AM, accompanied by a team of lawyers. According to a News First court reporter, President's Counsel Shanaka Ranasinghe and around 15 other lawyers represented Tennakoon in court.Although Tennakoon surrendered to the court in the morning, the hearing before Magistrate Aruna Buddhadasa began around 12:40 PM.Additional Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris, representing the Attorney General, also appeared at the Matara Magistrate's to present arguments.President's Counsel Shanaka Ranasinghe, representing Tennakoon, highlighted that his client surrendered immediately after the Court of Appeal rejected his request for legal relief. Excerpt from President's Counsel Shanaka Ranasinghe's Statement:\"If bail is denied, there are only two reasons under the Bail Act: evading investigations and influencing witnesses. Although the Supreme Court suspended his duties as IGP, he conducted the Yuthukama operation, arresting many criminals. If he is remanded, he must be provided proper protection in prison. However, I request that he be released on suitable bail conditions.\"Despite these arguments, Additional Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris strongly opposed granting bail.Additional Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris presented extensive arguments against granting bail to former Inspector General of Police IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon.Excerpt from Additional Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris's Statement:\"Your Honor, this morning I learned that a suspect with an open warrant arrived in court in a Benz, wearing a tie and coat, accompanied by two other vehicles. This is why I am here on behalf of the Attorney General. I did not expect this; they came to court like a thief in the night, without informing us about the motion, and tried to get bail. When I arrived, he was sitting in the front row, wearing a tie and coat. I want to ask, Your Honor, how can a suspect with an open warrant be sitting here instead of being in custody? A suspect with an open warrant should be in custody, not sitting here. A criminal cannot come to court and sit here comfortably. A criminal should come to court fearing the law, crawling on the ground. I said in the Court of Appeal that this suspect is not suitable even for the position of a police constable, let alone the IGP. I apologize to all police constables for saying this. Your Honor, he is not suitable even for the position of a police constable. He turned off his phone, played hide-and-seek, and evaded court for 20 days. He is a top-class actor. He is also an organized criminal, second only to figures like Makandure Madush and Harak Kata. He shamelessly came before your court only after his nose was filled with water. He named you as the first respondent in his petition to the Court of Appeal, accusing you of conspiring by closing the court doors. We have not fallen to such a state. He said that lawyers protect criminals, but today he came to court surrounded by lawyers. This is not a case about the W15 hotel shooting. This is karma. He does not need an explanation of what karma is. His eyes are already showing it. This is his karma, and it has come to fruition in this very life.\"Additional Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris presented details regarding the properties and investigations related to former Inspector General of Police IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon.Excerpt from Additional Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris's Statement:\"Your Honor, since the court order was issued on February 27, a massive operation has been conducted to locate him, similar to searching for Prabhakaran. Until yesterday, he and his family were hiding, using social, political, and religious power. The address he provided as his legal residence is occupied by a monk. Over the past days, we questioned officials and politicians, and checked houses. He has made deals with these people. During the search of his house yesterday, we found 795 bottles of alcohol, worth millions. Government employees can't afford such luxuries, but he had around a hundred hampers. His house is not a home but a warehouse. He claims there are life threats if remanded, but he hid for 20 days, even hiding his service firearm among clothes. He has no registered property in his name, not even a bicycle. However, it has been revealed that he unofficially owns eight houses. We inspected one of these houses, and the people there didn't even know who owned it. They thought it was Deshabandu's house. This is why I said that even organized crime gang leaders can't operate this discreetly. We also found that none of his family members have been registered in the voter list since 2021. He is truly a supernatural force, a ghost.\"After considering arguments from both sides, the Magistrate has decided to announce the bail decision for former Inspector General of Police IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon tomorrow at 2 PM.Following the court proceedings, Tennakoon was taken to the Angunakolapelessa Prison under heavy security.\"Tomorrow at 2 PM, the Honorable Magistrate will make a statement. We will see the order tomorrow. A significant number of lawyers appeared on behalf of both parties,\" said Attorney-at-Law Anuttara Samanraj.On December 31, 2023, officers from the Colombo Crimes Division CCD were involved in a shooting incident at the W15 Hotel in Pelena, Matara. Subsequently, officers from the Weligama Police and the Special Task Force fired upon the CCD team.The incident resulted in the death of a CCD officer and injuries to another. Investigations revealed that the attack was allegedly orchestrated by Tennakoon.",

The discussion on these serious crimes, which occurred between 1988 and 1990, resurfaced following questions posed to former President Ranil Wickremesinghe during Al Jazeera's Head to Head program.This report, allegedly kept in a dark room at the Presidential Office, was recently tabled in Parliament. A debate on the report is now scheduled for April 10.In recent days, News 1st uncovered several serious incidents revealed by the Batalanda Commission report. The following revelation is yet another grave matter.Reginald Sylvester Vincent Fernando, also known as Reggie, is a key witness mentioned in the Batalanda Commission report. Reggie witnessed many events firsthand at the notorious torture chamber maintained at the Batalanda Housing Complex, which was like a resort for some, and was closely associated with the individuals involved.He provided a confidential statement to the commission.Excerpt from the Batalanda Commission Report:\"This witness's testimony appears to impact the ethical rights and political status of the current Opposition Leader, Ranil Wickremesinghe. Certain sensitive details were also included in the statement.\"Vincent Fernando, also known as Reggie, mysteriously died a few days before Ranil Wickremesinghe was scheduled to appear before the commission. However, limited information from Reggie's confidential statement is included in the commission report.Who is Vincent Fernando, also known as Reggie?In 1980, Reggie worked as a sanitary worker and caretaker at the National Youth Services Council's tourist bungalow in Nilaveli, Trincomalee. During this period, Ranil Wickremesinghe, then Minister of Youth Affairs and Employment, visited the bungalow several times and spent the night there.\"Ranil Wickremesinghe and Director General Charitha Rathwatte came and prepared food. I helped them, and Ranil Wickremesinghe asked me to get two chili peppers. I washed them and put them on a plate. While eating string hoppers and biryani, Vincent was asked if he wanted to join their circuit. Vincent nodded yes, and after about 15 days, he was asked to come to Batalanda,\" disclosed H.M. Jayawira, a friend of Vincent Fernando.\"Vincent Fernando was with us during that time. Ranil Wickremesinghe often came to the center, stayed for five or six days, and left. Before he came, the Navy and Army provided security. Ranil Wickremesinghe's private security guards, including Gonawala Sunil, came and stayed here. Vincent Fernando provided all the facilities for them,\" revealed Jayasiri Manawadu, another friend of Vincent Fernando.In his confidential statement, Reggie claimed that Ranil Wickremesinghe wanted to eliminate suspects. Excerpt from the Batalanda Commission Report:\"Regarding the subversive suspects, Wickremesinghe was heard telling police officers to 'get them out.'\"Reggie stated before the commission that he overheard conversations among police officers at the Batalanda Housing Complex about suspects being killed. He mentioned that suspects were detained in houses B8, B4, and B1.House A2 3 was allocated to Reggie by Ranil Wickremesinghe.Excerpt from the Batalanda Commission Report:\"Although this witness provided evidence against Wickremesinghe, implicating him in serious crimes, the lawyers representing Ranil Wickremesinghe decided not to cross-examine the witness. The commission was puzzled by this decision. The witness died a few days before Wickremesinghe was issued a summons to testify before the commission. He was 36 years old at the time of his death. The commission did not investigate the circumstances of his death due to lack of authority.\"\"The investigators of the Batalanda Commission met Vincent Fernando, who narrated the entire story. His testimony was taken by then-Deputy Inspector General of Police Punya de Silva. The confidential statement is with the CID and the complete testimony is with the Batalanda Commission. All the crimes committed here were revealed to the world. The punishment was that three days before Ranil Wickremesinghe was summoned to testify before the Batalanda Commission in October 1997, Vincent Fernando, aged 36, suddenly died,\" said Nandana Weerarathna, a Journalist.Will the Batalanda Commission report end with a parliamentary debate? Or will the law take action for the grave crimes committed?",

        "content": "The new trove of top secret files released on the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy left experts trawling for new clues and Donald Trump's own staff scrambling. The release early Tuesday evening included 2,182 PDF documents totaling 63,400 pages on the National Archives website more than 60 years after the president was shot and killed in Dallas.It included typewritten reports and handwritten notes spanning decades, including details of a top CIA agent who claimed the deep state was responsible, Lee Harvey Oswald being a 'poor shot' and that Secret Service had been warned Kennedy would be killed in August, three months before the murder.The rollout of the files stunned Trump's national security team, who spent 24 hours racing to assess security hazards ahead of publication.When the files were released at around 7pm, it sparked widespread backlash, from liberals claiming it was just a repeat of a similar drop by Joe Biden years ago, to MAGA fans angered that the pages still contained redactions and left questions, leading experts to describe the files as 'impenetrable.'Experts have warned as they sift through the information that they do not expect the release to overturn the long understanding of what happened or earth-shattering reveals.The document batch did not include annotations, what agency documents originated from, how they were linked together or whether they were found more credible than others to the investigation. Its publication represents the fulfillment of a campaign promise from Trump, who had threatened to get the files out dating back to his first term in office. Still, those digging through the thousands of pages have uncovered some intriguing details. One document was a memo released on a passage from the left wing political magazine Ramparts from June 1967 about intelligence agent, CIA informant and former US Army Captain John Garrett Underhill Jr. 'The day after the assassination, Gary Underhill left Washington in a hurry. Late in the evening he showed up at the home of a friend in New Jersey He was very agitated,' the passage starts.'A small clique within the CIA was responsible for the assassination, he confided, and he was afraid for his life and probably would have to leave the country. Less than six months later Underhill was found shot to death in his Washington apartment. The coroner ruled it a suicide,' the passage continued.It noted that he was on 'intimate terms with a number of high-ranking CIA officials. The passage was shared numerous times by conservatives on social media on Tuesday night. But others dismissed it, pointed out the magazine passage had been publicly available and discussed for decades. Another document making the rounds in MAGA world Tuesday night after the release focused on Kennedy's assassin Lee Harvey Oswald. One line in the document stated that KGB watched Oswald closely while he was in the USSR. But files indicated that Oswald was a poor shot when he tried target filing in the USSR.'Another detail released was a letter sent by a man named Sergyj Czornonoh in 1978 to the British Embassy. He claimed that he was detained in London on July 18, 1963 and questioned by authorities.Czornonoh said that he told them about Lee Harvey Oswald, saying he planned to kill the president.He added that he warned American Vice Consul Tom Blackshear of the plans of Oswald, who trying to defect to Russia. While Trump's team was working on getting the records out since the president returned to the White House in January, those plans were put into overdrive on Monday.The president said during a media event at the Kennedy Center that the files were all going to be released on Tuesday. National security analysts were scrambling to make sure there were no hazards in what they were about to publish with a supercharged deadline. CIA Director John Ratcliffe had wanted to have everyone prepped on what was in the documents so that they wouldn't be caught off guard, the New York Times reports. Source: Daily Mail",

        "content": "Suspended Inspector General of Police Deshabandu Tennakoon was remanded until Thursday 20, by the Matara Magistrate's Court. An order with regard to bail, will be made tomorrow. Deshabandu Tennakoon arrived at the Matara Magistrate's Court on Wednesday 19 morning. Tennakoon's court appearance is linked to a shooting incident near the W15 Hotel in Weligama on December 31, 2023. Earlier, a joint operation was launched to arrest suspended Inspector General of Police IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon, under the direct supervision of the Acting IGP. The operation aimed to apprehend not only Deshabandu Tennakoon but also individuals who are aiding and abetting him in evading arrest. On February 28, Matara Magistrate ordered the arrest of Tennakoon and eight others based on the CID's findings into the incident that took place in 2023. Following further submissions by the CID, the Magistrate Court issued an open warrant for Tennakoon's arrest. On March 7, Tennakoon filed a writ petition with the Court of Appeal, seeking an interim order to suspend the Matara Magistrate Court's directive. The petition was however, dismissed. On December 31, 2023, a shooting occurred in front of the W-15 Hotel in Pelena, Weligama, Matara. A Colombo Crimes Division officer was killed, and another officer was seriously injured in the incident. The Criminal Investigation Department CID conducted an investigation and reported the findings to the Matara Magistrate Court on February 27. On 31st December 2023, Eight officers from the Colombo Crimes Division, dressed in civilian clothes, went to Weligama, claiming that associates of a drug-related suspect named Harak Kata were staying at the hotel. The CID revealed that the officers opened fire at the hotel. Subsequently, officers from the Weligama Police and the Special Task Force arrived at the scene, and had opened fire at the fleeing Colombo Crime Division officers' van. The van fled towards the Imaduwa entrance of the Expressway, where the police eventually apprehended them. One of the main allegations against suspended IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon was that he had sent Colombo Crime Division officers to the Southern Province for personal reasons. Investigations later accused Tennakoon of maintaining an unofficial armed squad.",

        "content": "A renewed discussion has emerged regarding the infamous Batalanda torture chamber, where thousands of young people were illegally abducted, tortured, killed, or disappeared during the 1988 90 period.This discussion was sparked by comments made by Ranil Wickremesinghe during an interview with Al Jazeera.A report on the Batalanda torture chamber, prepared by a Presidential Commission, has now been submitted to Parliament and is scheduled for debate on April 10.The report reveals numerous crimes committed under the guise of suppressing insurgent activities.Here's another story from the Batalanda Report.Wasala Jayasekara was a clerk at a state bank branch in Kelaniya.On October 16, 1990, an armed group entered the bank and stole approximately two hundred thousand rupees from the vault.Jayasekara, who had nine years of service experience, was arrested on October 18, suspected of being involved in the robbery.Wasala Jayasekara was taken to the Peliyagoda police station and presented before Assistant Superintendent of Police Douglas Peiris.Later, Jayasekara testified before the Batalanda Commission, stating that he had no involvement in the robbery and that Douglas Peiris had assaulted him.According to Jayasekara's testimony, he was taken to the upper floor of the police station, stripped naked, and beaten by a group of police officers.During this time, chili powder was put in his eyes, and his fingers were pricked with pins.After being detained at the police station for three days, Jayasekara was taken to the Batalanda torture chamber.In his testimony before the commission, Jayasekara stated that when he was taken there, several people were lying naked on the ground, writhing in pain.Jayasekara was taken to a room in one of the houses and stripped naked again.He testified that while he was imprisoned in the room, he heard people being beaten and screaming in pain.A few days later, Jayasekara was taken out of the house, put into a vehicle, and brought back to the Peliyagoda police station.He was later presented to the court.Jayasekara told the magistrate that he had been beaten and was urinating blood.The court ordered that the suspect be presented to a doctor and a judicial medical officer. On February 15, 1991, the police informed the court that there was no evidence against the suspect, and he was released.Although no lawyer had appeared for the suspect until then, on June 3, lawyer Anil Gunawardena appeared for him.According to later revelations, Wasala Jayasekara's father was informed by Sergeant Upali Jayasekara to meet lawyer Anil Gunawardena if he wanted his son to be released from prison.The sergeant informed Jayasekara's father to meet the lawyer on Waragoda Road in Kelaniya.Jayasekara's father met the lawyer, who demanded fifty thousand rupees, promising to secure Wasala's release.The money was needed to be given to Assistant Superintendent Of Police Douglas Peiris, according to the lawyer.Wasala Jayasekara was released after this process.Previously, Earl Sugie Perera, also known as Sydney, was kidnapped and money was extorted in a similar manner.These kidnappings and extortion attempts occurred while Rohana Wijeweera, the leader of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, was also assassinated.Shouldn't these incidents be properly investigated and justice served to the victims?Shouldn't proper steps be taken to prevent such barbaric conditions from recurring?",

According to those orders, granting bail to the suspect at this stage could hinder ongoing investigations. The Court of Appeal's decision also instructed appropriate actions against those who aided the suspect in evading arrest for 20 days. Granting bail to the suspect now could complicate the enforcement of those orders. Additionally, the court considered the submissions made by the Attorney General yesterday. Taking these factors into account, the court rejects the bail application and remands the suspect until April 3rd.\"The Magistrate ordered the complainant's lawyers to conduct a thorough investigation and report progress. He also instructed investigations into those who aided the suspect in evading arrest.Additional Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris, representing the complainant, requested the court's permission to record statements from the suspect while in prison.He also requested an order to investigate the mobile phone used by the suspect during his time in hiding.The Magistrate granted these requests.Quote Of Additional Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris:\"Your Honor, this week has been significant in my professional career. On the 17th, I stated before the Honorable Court of Appeal Judge Laffar that this case's decision would be historic. Today, I say before your court that the 82-page inquest report issued by your court on February 27th initiated this excellent investigation. The 12-page order issued today sends a strong message about the rule of law and the enforcement of justice. No one can commit crimes and hide behind power. Those who do should be cautious now.\"\"I came to this court today with shame. Having to come to court under police protection is a sign of a state's failure. We need a safe environment to perform our duties. That is the true independence of the judiciary. I will not appear for this case in the future. However, I will provide necessary guidance and support to my junior officers for the investigation. I am appearing only for the eighth suspect in this case. I will not appear for the main case. Investigating officers must conclude this investigation immediately. Delaying investigations for various reasons will lead to justice being denied. Your Honor may also be transferred, and these matters will be forgotten. Some officers deliberately delay investigations, leading to justice being obstructed.\"Dileepa Peiris stated that the other six individuals named as suspects in this case would surrender to the court tomorrow by filing a motion.Quote:\"Your Honor, if there is a politician or official above the main suspect Deshabandu Tennakoon, they should also be investigated and arrested immediately. Therefore, I urge investigating officers not to delay such cases and to deliver justice promptly.\"The Matara Magistrate's Court revealed today that Deshabandu Tennakoon is being investigated under nine charges.These charges include dereliction of duty as a government employee, using eight officers in an illegal assembly for criminal purposes, shooting to intimidate and conspire to cause harm, fabricating false evidence, causing harm with fire or explosives, criminal coercion, causing the death of a police officer through deliberate negligence, causing damage to public property, and committing an offense with an automatic firearm.",

        "date": "20-03-2025 | 4:11 PM",
        "content": "The rare fungus Mutinus bambusinus has been documented in Sri Lanka for the first time in over 100 years. The fungus, a type of stinkhorn, was initially recorded in 1919 at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Peradeniya, Central Province. This recent sighting occurred in July 2023 in a home garden in Galle, Southern Province. The rediscovery of Mutinus bambusinus, detailed in a study published in the Ceylon Journal of Science, marks the first published record of this species in 104 years. The study was conducted by researchers from the University of Peradeniya, the Wildlife Conservation Society Galle, Wayamba University of Sri Lanka, and the National Institute of Fundamental Studies. Fungi, including the Mutinus bambusinus, play a crucial role in ecosystems by aiding in nutrient recycling, bioremediation, and serving as biofertilizers. Despite their importance, many fungal species remain understudied, with over 85 of Sri Lanka's estimated 25,000 fungal species yet to be discovered.",

        "date": "20-03-2025 | 3:11 PM",
        "content": "Sri Lanka's suspended Police Chief Deshabandu Tennakoon was remanded until the 3rd of April 2025. He was produced at the Matara Magistrate's Court on Thursday 20. Deshabandu Appears In Court After Weeks On The Run: Suspended Inspector General of Police IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon, who was ordered to be arrested on sight, appeared before the Matara Magistrate's Court on Wednesday morning 19 and was subsequently remanded until Thursday 20. Lawyers representing Tennakoon requested bail, but Additional Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris, representing the Attorney General, strongly opposed the request. Peiris argued that Tennakoon is a notorious organized criminal, worse than underworld figures like Makandure Madush and Harak Kata. Suspended Inspector General of Police IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon, who was ordered to be arrested on sight, appeared before the Matara Magistrate's Court at approximately 7:30 AM, accompanied by a team of lawyers. According to a News First court reporter, President's Counsel Shanaka Ranasinghe and around 15 other lawyers represented Tennakoon in court. Although Tennakoon surrendered to the court in the morning, the hearing before Magistrate Aruna Buddhadasa began around 12:40 PM. Additional Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris, representing the Attorney General, also appeared at the Matara Magistrate's to present arguments. President's Counsel Shanaka Ranasinghe, representing Tennakoon, highlighted that his client surrendered immediately after the Court of Appeal rejected his request for legal relief. Excerpt from President's Counsel Shanaka Ranasinghe's Statement: \"If bail is denied, there are only two reasons under the Bail Act: evading investigations and influencing witnesses. Although the Supreme Court suspended his duties as IGP, he conducted the Yukthiya operation, arresting many criminals. If he is remanded, he must be provided proper protection in prison. However, I request that he be released on suitable bail conditions.\" Despite these arguments, Additional Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris strongly opposed granting bail. Additional Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris presented extensive arguments against granting bail to former Inspector General of Police IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon. Excerpt from Additional Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris's Statement: \"Your Honor, this morning I learned that a suspect with an open warrant arrived in court in a Benz, wearing a tie and coat, accompanied by two other vehicles. This is why I am here on behalf of the Attorney General. I did not expect this; they came to court like a thief in the night, without informing us about the motion, and tried to get bail. When I arrived, he was sitting in the front row, wearing a tie and coat. I want to ask, Your Honor, how can a suspect with an open warrant be sitting here instead of being in custody? A suspect with an open warrant should be in custody, not sitting here. A criminal cannot come to court and sit here comfortably. A criminal should come to court fearing the law, crawling on the ground. I said in the Court of Appeal that this suspect is not suitable even for the position of a police constable, let alone the IGP. I apologize to all police constables for saying this. Your Honor, he is not suitable even for the position of a police constable. He turned off his phone, played hide-and-seek, and evaded court for 20 days. He is a top-class actor. He is also an organized criminal, worse than underworld figures like Makandure Madush and Harak Kata. He shamelessly came before your court only after his nose was filled with water. He named you as the first respondent in his petition to the Court of Appeal, accusing you of conspiring by closing the court doors. We have not fallen to such a state. He said that lawyers protect criminals, but today he came to court surrounded by lawyers. This is not a case about the W15 hotel shooting. This is karma. He does not need an explanation of what karma is. His eyes are already showing it. This is his karma, and it has come to fruition in this very life.\" After considering arguments from both sides, the Magistrate has decided to announce the bail decision for former Inspector General of Police IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon on Thursday 20 at 2 PM. Following the court proceedings, Tennakoon was taken to the Angunakolapelessa Prison under heavy security. Why Did Court Order the Arrest of Deshabandu Tennakoon? On December 31, 2023, officers from the Colombo Crimes Division CCD were involved in a shooting incident at the W15 Hotel in Pelena, Matara. Subsequently, officers from the Weligama Police and the Special Task Force fired upon the CCD team. The incident resulted in the death of a CCD officer and injuries to another. Investigations revealed that the attack was allegedly orchestrated by Tennakoon. A warrant was issued on February 28, 2025, in connection with a shooting incident near a hotel in Weligama on December 31, 2023, which resulted in the death of an officer from the Colombo Crime Division. The Matara Magistrate's Court had ordered the arrest of Tennakoon and eight others involved in the incident. Following the issuance of the warrant, Tennakoon was also subjected to an international travel ban. Despite this, he evaded arrest, prompting the police to launch a special operation to apprehend him. In a bid to avoid arrest, Tennakoon filed a writ petition with the Court of Appeal, seeking an interim order to prevent his detention. However, the Court of Appeal rejected his petition and instructed the police to arrest Tennakoon immediately and present him before the Matara Magistrate's Court. The Court of Appeal also ordered legal action against individuals who assisted Tennakoon in evading arrest.",

The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?\" The US fell to its lowest-ever ranking in the 2025 edition of the World Happiness Report amid rising social isolation and political polarisation, while Finland and other Nordic countries remained at the top of the index. Finland continued in the top spot this year, followed by Denmark, Iceland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, Norway, Israel, Luxembourg, and Mexico. At the bottom of the index, Afghanistan ranked the lowest, followed by Sierra Leone, Lebanon, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Yemen, Comoros and Lesotho.

        "content": "According to the contents of the Batalanda Commission report, it is up to the Attorney General to decide whether to file charges or conduct further investigations, President's Counsel Saliya Peiris pointed out.He expressed these views last night while participating in the Mawatha Intellectual Discussion.Under Section 2 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act No. 17 of 1948, then-President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga appointed the Batalanda Commission.This was to investigate the disappearances and illegal detentions of individuals during the 1988 90 period and the operation of detention centers under the Batalanda Housing Scheme.Despite several extensions granted by the then-President to conduct investigations, no further action was taken regarding the report.When former President Ranil Wickremesinghe was questioned by an Al Jazeera journalist about these crimes, he responded that the relevant commission report had not been tabled in Parliament.However, this report was tabled in Parliament last week.\"This report cannot directly punish anyone. The Attorney General must decide whether to file charges or conduct further investigations based on its contents. Except for crimes punishable by death, other crimes have a statute of limitations. Crimes cannot be prosecuted after 20 years. This legal situation exists. Practically, there are many questions about whether the witnesses mentioned in the report are still alive and able to testify in court. Murder is not subject to a statute of limitations, but abduction and torture are. These must be proven beyond reasonable doubt in court,\" explained President's Counsel Saliya Peiris.There is still living evidence of the existence of the Batalanda torture chamber and the abductions that took place.Ananda Jayakody, who now works as a court reporter, was also abducted and tortured at Batalanda.Jayakody was abducted on September 6, 1988, at the Kalagedihena junction.\"I was coming down the Kalagedihena road. The Kandy road is narrow, with a single lane. There was a bus stop towards Kandy, and many children were standing there. Among the children were some terrorists dressed in civilian clothes, state terrorists. There was a commotion. I wanted to mislead them, so I ran across the road, holding my file bag. One of them jumped from behind, and I hit him with the bag without looking. He fell in the middle of the road. I ran, and they shot at me. I was dragged along the ground,\" he said.Dr. A.P. Karunaratne, an Ayurvedic doctor from the Attanagalla area, was a police officer in charge of the weapons storage at the Batalanda torture chamber.Now 96 years old, he still suffers mentally, recalling his minor involvement in these crimes.\"Every day, they brought ten or fifteen guns. I took charge of them and handed them over every evening,\" said A.P. Karunaratne, the Former Weapons Custodian at Batalanda.When asked about the individuals who were brought to Batalanda, he said, \"They were brought in vans and jeeps. I saw them being brought in. Even now, I feel a lot of distress. The girls would ask to see their mothers. We also had mothers. When I sleep, I see them being beaten and killed in my dreams. I built a Buddha shrine to find some peace. I am still not free. I see them in my dreams, calling me to come over.\"Such eyewitness evidence can still be identified.The question now is whether to let this report be buried by the sands of time or to seek justice for at least the murders that occurred.\"What we see through these commission reports is that they need to be brought to a clear state. The current government has the responsibility to transform this country into a new political culture. These commission reports show us a very important aspect of this cultural transformation. We need to take the next steps. We are still talking about the Easter attacks. The inquiry into the Easter attacks is not over. It's not just the bond scam; there was also a commission to investigate fraud and corruption. Parliament has these reports. Justice must be served for all these unfinished tasks. It is essential for the dignity and respect of our state,\" explained Dr. Navaratna Bandara.",

The debate highlighted various allegations and concerns regarding his conduct and the legal proceedings against him.During the session, MP Dayasiri Jayasekara from the Samagi Jana Balawegaya raised serious allegations over government's handling of the situation, and also mentioned that attempts were made to seize Tennakoon's property, which led to his surrender.\"When he surrendered, Dileepa Peiris said this Police Chief doesn't even have the right to vote. His name isn't registered. He doesn't even have a bicycle to his name. The Deputy Solicitor General says he's a ghost. Who protected him all this time? Now, Minister Watagala earlier said they knew where the Police Chief was and will arrest him in due time. For the first time, the Solicitor General says that he won't appear in this case again due to security concerns. So, his juniors will handle it. This is where the law stands,\" said MP Jayasekera.Attorney-at-Law Sunil Watagala, Deputy Minister of Public Security, responded by asserting that the law had been enforced appropriately. He emphasized that the legal proceedings against Tennakoon were conducted in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Code and denied any claims of knowing Tennakoon's whereabouts.Minister of Industry and Enterprise Development, Sunil Handunnetti, also contributed to the debate, urging members to refrain from recording certain information in Hansard. He highlighted the sensitivity of the information and its potential implications.Jayasekara reiterated his commitment to transparency, stating that he would present his evidence for parliamentary consideration.Handunnetti, in turn, challenged the opposition's stance, questioning their previous support for Tennakoon and their current criticisms.The session underscored the deep divisions and ongoing tensions within the government and opposition regarding the handling of Tennakoon's case. The controversy continues to unfold, with significant implications for the political landscape and public trust in the legal system.Minister of Industry and Enterprise Development, Sunil Handunnetti, addressed the issue, challenging those who question why Tennakoon was arrested after many days. He pointed out that many of these critics previously held ministerial positions and supported the government while Tennakoon was in power. Handunnetti emphasized that during the Rajapaksa administration, such open criticism would not have been possible, and officials would have been too afraid to speak out.Handunnetti highlighted the current government's commitment to upholding the law and ensuring that officials can speak freely without fear. He criticized the opposition for their dramatic behavior in Parliament, suggesting that their actions were more about media attention than genuine concern.The minister also recalled how, in previous parliaments, members were intimidated by the presence of senior Rajapaksa family members. He noted that today, opposition members speak boldly because of the humility and openness of the current administration.",

        "date": "22-03-2025 | 9:26 PM",
        "content": "Information regarding several grave crimes, which were intended to be buried under the sands of time, is now being unveiled as the Batalanda Commission Report comes back into discussion.The conversation about these serious crimes, which occurred between 1988 and 1990, resurfaced following questions posed to former President Ranil Wickremesinghe during an Al Jazeera Head to Head program.This report, allegedly kept in a dark room at the President's Office, was recently presented in Parliament.Today, we focus on several key decisions outlined in Chapter 9 of the Batalanda Commission Report.Sub-Inspector of Police Rohitha PriyadarshanaWho was he?Why is this officer significant?In recent days, we have uncovered several shocking revelations from the Batalanda Commission Report.The report pays particular attention to Rohitha Priyadarshana, who, after going to Nalanda College, Colombo, joined the Special Task Force of the Police Department in 1986.Priyadarshana, who also had a natural talent for Cricket, was assigned to the Criminal Investigation Division of the Sapugaskanda Police Station in the Kelaniya Police Division in 1989.He played a pivotal role in uncovering the underlying causes of numerous crimes, thefts, and other serious offenses within the Kelaniya Division.The Commission Report meticulously details several key developments surrounding the disappearance of Rohitha Priyadarshana on or around February 20, 1990.According to the findings of the Commission, Priyadarshana performed his duties with distinction while serving at the Sapugaskanda Police Station, and he refrained from considering political affiliations when arresting suspects.The Batalanda Commission Report asserts that there is no evidence linking him to the attack on the Sapugaskanda Police Station.In early February 1990, Rohitha Priyadarshana arrested Tudor Perera, the nephew of Sunil Perera, also known as Gonawala Sunil.The Commission notes that Sunil Perera and his family were well-known activists and supporters of the then-ruling United National Party.Sub-Inspector of Police Rohitha Priyadarshana, the OIC of the Criminal Investigation Division at the Sapugaskanda Police Station, mysteriously vanished on February 20, 1990.On February 20, then-Police Inspector Keerthi Athapattu, who was the OIC of the Sapugaskanda Police Station, left to attend a meeting at the Biyagama Village Hotel.Later, around 8 PM, the OIC called Rohitha Priyadarshana, instructing him to come to the Biyagama Village Hotel.Rohitha Priyadarshana went to the Biyagama Village Hotel that evening, but he never returned to the Sapugaskanda Police Station or his home.Surprisingly, the police made little effort to investigate his disappearance properly.The Commission Report reveals that police in Kelaniya refused to acknowledge that Priyadarshana had been murdered.The Batalanda Commission unequivocally states that instead of conducting a thorough investigation, a deliberate cover-up campaign was initiated.The report concludes that the decision to issue a statement claiming that Rohitha Priyadarshana had \"abandoned his post\" was part of this cover-up, designed to imply that his disappearance was voluntary.In line with this narrative, a suspect named Kaduruwahenage Jinadasa sought to suggest that Rohitha Priyadarshana had disappeared out of fear of revealing information that could implicate him.The Commission affirms that the official account of Priyadarshana's disappearance is entirely false.The findings also implicate Assistant Superintendent of Police Keerthi Athapattu as being directly involved in Priyadarshana's disappearance.Deputy Inspector General of Police Merrill Gunaratne, Senior Superintendent of Police Nalin Delgoda, and Assistant Superintendent of Police Raja Dias are criticized for their failure to take appropriate legal action regarding the disappearance.The Commission also asserts that Assistant Superintendent of Police Douglas Peiris played an indirect role in the officer's disappearance.Whose agenda was it to make disappear such officers, who served selflessly for the betterment of the country, regardless of political connections, in their pursuit of justice?What was being concealed by suppressing the investigations?Shouldn t there be a comprehensive investigation into such heinous acts, and shouldn't justice be served?More details from the Commission's findings will be revealed tomorrow.",

        "content": "In 1995, shortly after Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga came to power, she ordered the establishment of the Batalaanda Commission of Inquiry on September 21st to investigate the infamous Batalaanda incidents.The commission was tasked with probing the illegal detention, torture, murder, and disappearance of young individuals in the Batalaanda Housing Scheme in Biyagama, a property which was under the purview of the State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation.Today, we delve into some of the commission's key findings regarding the events that transpired at the Batalaanda Housing Complex between 1988 and 1990.What Did the Batalanda Commission Uncover?The commission's report underscores that several houses within the Batalaanda Housing Complex were used for illegal detention and torture during the period between January 1, 1988, and December 31, 1990.The complex was under the purview of the State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation at the time, which was under the Ministry of Industries.Ranil Wickremesinghe, then the Minister of Industries, played a pivotal role in this dark chapter of Sri Lanka's history.The commission's findings revealed that Ranil Wickremesinghe instructed officials from the State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation to allocate and release houses in the Batalaanda Housing Scheme to police officers from the Kelaniya Police Division.Key houses in the complex, including A 2 2, A 2 1, A 2 3, A 1 7, B 2, B 1, and B 7, were assigned for use by these officers.The commission discovered that several of these houses were used by a police unit led by Douglas Peiris, the Officer-in-Charge of the Peliyagoda Police Station. 13 houses were also allocated to the Kelaniya Anti-Subversive Operations Unit.Shockingly, one of these houses was even designated as Ranil Wickremesinghe's personal office.The commission found that Ranil Wickremesinghe had abused his ministerial authority by facilitating the unlawful occupation of houses in the Batalaanda Housing Complex.Police officers from the Kelaniya Police Division, fully aware of the illegal activities occurring within the complex, violated departmental regulations in occupying these homes.The commission identified 15 police officers including Assistant Superintendent of Police Douglas Peiris, Chief Inspector of Police Ranjith Wickramasinghe, and Senior Superintendent of Police Nalin Delgoda.The commission also criticized Deputy Inspector General of Police Merrill Gunaratne for his failure to take action, allowing the illegal occupancy of the Batalaanda Housing Complex to continue unchecked.The commission accused Senior Superintendent of Police Nalin Delgoda of intentionally failing to prevent these houses from being used for unlawful purposes.The commission identified 13 officers directly responsibile for the illegal detention and torture of individuals including:Assistant Superintendent of Police Douglas PeirisChief Inspector of Police Ranjith WickramasinghePolice Sergeant RatnayakePolice Sergeant RanatungaSub-Inspector of Police DelgahagodaPolice Sergeant Upali LakhewaPolice Constable Driver RanjithPolice Constable JayawardenaPolice Constable HeenbandaPolice Sergeant KappagodaPolice Constable Padmini PremalathaPolice Constable LakshmanPolice Inspector Sunil Bandara NissankaWhat was Ranil Wickremesinghe's role in this?The commission's findings expose that police meetings held at the Batalaanda Housing Complex during this period were explicitly unauthorized by the Ministry of Defense.Yet, Ranil Wickremesinghe, then the Minister of Industries, took it upon himself to chair these meetings, even though he had no legal authority to do so.Ranil Wickremesinghe personally instructed the liquidator of the State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation to set up illegal detention centres in houses within the complex, including B2, B8, B34, and A1 8.The report also names Assistant Superintendent of Police Douglas Peiris and Chief Inspector of Police Ranjith Wickramasinghe as the ones who set up and ran these illegal detention centres, where people were tortured and mistreated.The Commission clearly states that then Inspector General of Police, Ernest Perera, knew exactly what was happening but chose to do nothing about it.Why was nothing done to stop these brutal acts in a government-owned housing complex?Who truly benefited from these horrific actions, and why did they go unpunished for so long?Should we allow these crimes to be buried in the past as if they never happened?Or is it time to face the truth?",

The court also acquitted Sydney Jayasinghe, a businessman who was co-accused in the case. The charges stemmed from allegations that between September 26, 1996, and September 25, 1997, Gammanpila and Jayasinghe had misused a fraudulent Power of Attorney to sell shares worth Rs. 21 million belonging to a company owned by Australian businessman Brian Shaddick. After a lengthy trial, High Court Judge Namal Balalle ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. The court's decision highlighted the lack of sufficient evidence to support the allegations against the accused. Gammanpila, leader of the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya PHU, expressed his relief at the verdict, stating that the truth had prevailed and that the court had recognized the baseless nature of the charges.

        "date": "24-03-2025 | 4:09 PM",
        "content": "Former Sri Lankan Sub-Inspector Ajith Jayasinghe, now living in Australia, played a pivotal role in the search for the missing Officer-in-Charge of the Sapugaskanda Police Station's Crime Investigation Division, Rohitha Priyadarshana. Ajith, who was serving in the Traffic Division of the Peliyagoda Police Station, took leave to fully dedicate himself to finding his missing friend. On February 23, 1990, Ajith made a bold statement in the Peliyagoda Police Station's detention cell, declaring that whoever killed Priyadarshana would be found and killed. This declaration led to Ajith being pursued for his life. On February 26, 1990, while returning from the police hospital with another individual via Baseline Road, Assistant Superintendent of Police Douglas Peiris attempted to abduct Ajith. ASP Peiris had reportedly signaled Ajith to stop his motorcycle. As Ajith dismounted and approached Peiris, he reported to the Presidential Commission that Peiris placed a pistol to his neck. Subsequently, Peiris's police team seized Ajith's firearm and placed him in a van, taking him to the torture chamber. Inside the van, Ajith pulled a grenade from his pocket and removed the pin, causing the police officers to jump out of the van. Peiris then approached Ajith, asking him to hand over the grenade. Ajith had jumped out of the van, and Peiris had moved further away. The Commission report states that a large crowd gathered at the scene. Ajith showed his official ID to the military personnel who arrived subsequently, and requested to be taken to the Senior Superintendent of Police in Kelaniya. The military personnel thereafter had detonated the grenade in a deserted area, and they took him to the Peliyagoda Police Station. At the Peliyagoda Police Station, Ajith sought protection from Senior Superintendent of Police Nalin Delgoda, who, according to Ajith's testimony, assaulted him with a firearm. Ajith was detained at the Pelawatta Detention Center from October 27, 1990, to January 7, 1992, on charges of being associated with the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. A friend intervened and secured Ajith's release from the detention center after he agreed to certain conditions. Under these conditions, Ajith's friend arranged for him to be sent to the United Kingdom. Ajith Jayasinghe remains abroad to this day. \"My friend Rohitha's life was ultimately lost due to the murder of Gonawala Sunil's brother. Rohitha personally informed me about this. Within ten days of Gonawala Tudor's murder, Rohitha was killed. Rohitha told me that Tudor was killed during a sudden interrogation. SSP Delgoda informed me that Ranil Wickremesinghe had instructed to release Tudor. I asked why they were sending him now, questioning if there was anyone left. Delgoda was not flustered and said to inform the SSP immediately that Tudor died during questioning. I knew then that the issue was being taken up by Ranil Wickremesinghe. Ranil Wickremesinghe would order the SSP to release Tudor. The SSP said he would inform within half an hour that Tudor was dead. This was the immediate cause of Rohitha Priyadarshana's death,\" he told a social media channel. Former Sub-Inspector Ajith Jayasinghe has expressed his willingness to support any legal proceedings related to the Batalanda Torture Chamber. Such living testimonies can still be identified regarding the murders and other crimes that occurred at the Batalanda Torture Chamber. If the law is enforced, gathering this evidence should not be difficult. Is it not the public's expectation to see justice served for these crimes, rather than allowing them to be buried in the sands of time?",

However, some managed to escape or narrowly survived.The commission's report includes detailed accounts of the conditions within these torture chambers, with significant testimony provided by Dr. Wimal Aththanayake, an Ayurvedic physician.Dr. Aththanayake, who practiced in Bollagala, Biyagama, often treated police officers free of charge.In 1990, Police Inspector N.M.S.B. Nissanka and his team visited Dr. Aththanayake, bringing two injured detainees with them. The detainees had severe wounds, which Dr. Aththanayake treated.Three days later, Dr. Aththanayake was summoned to the Kelaniya Police Station, where Inspector Nissanka showed him one of the previously treated detainees, now in critical condition, and requested that he keep the detainee alive for at least one more day.Dr. Aththanayake treated the detainee and returned home, only to be taken to the Batalanda Housing Complex two days later. There, he witnessed six to eight individuals tied to a large iron bed with ropes, all bearing severe injuries. Inspector Nissanka had asked Dr. Aththanayake to treat these individuals as well.Dr. Aththanayake's testimony highlighted the appalling conditions and the severe injuries of the detainees, who emitted a strong odor and had wounds infested with maggots. After treating them, Dr. Aththanayake was taken to Inspector Nissanka's official residence within the complex and offered tea.When questioned by the commission, Inspector Nissanka denied asking Dr. Aththanayake to treat the detainees. Due to inconsistencies in his statements, the commission decided to examine him under oath. However, shortly before he was to testify, Inspector Nissanka reportedly committed suicide.Another individual, Vincent Fernando, who provided a confidential statement to the commission, also died under mysterious circumstances.These testimonies and attempts to silence witnesses reveal the horrifying truth of the torture chambers that claimed the lives of over 3,000 young men and women.Despite efforts to suppress the truth, living witnesses can still be found to testify about these atrocities.",

The court also ordered Patel to pay Rs 2 million in compensation to Tharanga.It was revealed in court that Patel fled to the United States via sea routes in January this year, evading the legal proceedings. High Court Judge Ravindra Premaratne delivered the verdict in Patel's absence.The charges against Patel stem from an incident during the 2024 Legends Trophy cricket tournament held at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium. Patel, the owner of the Kandy Samp Army team, allegedly approached Tharanga with a proposal to fix matches for financial gain.Tharanga reported the incident to the Anti-Corruption Unit, leading to Patel's arrest.Patel was initially released on bail but later absconded. The Attorney General subsequently filed the case under the Prevention of Offences Relating to Sports Act. This case marks the first instance in Sri Lanka where charges of match-fixing have been prosecuted and resulted in a conviction.It is also reported that this was the first case filed in South Asia, under the Prevention of Offences Relating to Sports Act.The investigation was conducted by the Special Police Investigation Unit established under the Prevention of Offences Relating to Sports Act No. 24 of 2019.",

        "content": "A proposal moved by 115 MPs from the ruling party seeking the removal of Deshabandu Tennakoon was done in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 of the Removal of Officers Procedure Act No. 5 of 2002. The Removal of Officers Procedure Act No. 5 of 2002 outlines the provisions for the removal of the Attorney General and the Inspector General of Police. According to the Act, these officials can be removed on grounds of misconduct, corruption, gross abuse of power, gross neglect of duty, and gross partiality, among other serious charges. As per the provisions of the act, a proposal to remove the Inspector General of Police IGP has been submitted, containing 27 charges, including misuse of power, severe neglect of duty, and partiality. Notable incidents leading to these charges include the shooting at the W15 Hotel in Weligama on December 31, 2023, and the death of an officer from the Colombo Crime Division. Additionally, the assault at the Aragalaya protest site on May 9, 2022, is also cited. The proposal highlights the IGP's failure to comply with court orders and evasion of arrest warrants related to the Weligama shooting incident. Under the Act, if a proposal signed by more than one-third of the total number of Members of Parliament is submitted, the Speaker is authorized to accept it. To initiate the formation of an investigative committee and the removal of the Inspector General of Police, a proposal must be submitted to the President. This proposal requires the approval of a majority of the total number of Members of Parliament, including those not present. A committee can then be appointed to investigate the charges and recommend the removal of the IGP. The committee must include a Supreme Court judge appointed by the Chief Justice, the Chairman of the National Police Commission, and an individual with distinguished expertise in law or public administration, appointed by the Speaker with the agreement of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Supreme Court judge appointed by the Chief Justice shall Chair the committee. If the committee finds the IGP guilty of the charges, the Speaker can include the removal proposal in the parliamentary agenda. The proposal must be approved by a majority of the total number of Members of Parliament, including those not present. Once approved, the President is required to promptly remove the individual from office. Deputy Minister of Labour Mahinda Jayasinghe has expressed confidence that the proposal to form an investigative committee and remove the Inspector General of Police will secure the necessary parliamentary majority. Speaking on the matter, Jayasinghe emphasized that a two-thirds majority will not be an issue. \"There are 158 NPP Members of Parliament, so obtaining a majority in Parliament will not pose any issues,\" Jayasinghe stated. When asked about the support from the opposition, Jayasinghe responded, \"The opposition's support is essential. They have consistently advocated for the rule of law and proper implementation of legal procedures. Therefore, there is no reason for the opposition to oppose this proposal.\"",

Not only me, but many prominent members like Patali, Rajitha, and Welgama have started leaving the party. Even Imthiaz, who took over the chairmanship after me, has left.

Bandula, who served as the personal bodyguard to the late Sri Lanka Mahajana Party leader Ossie Abeygunasekera, provided detailed testimony about the events that transpired on January 27, 1990.Bandula was assigned to protect Abeygunasekera following the assassination of party leader Vijaya Kumaratunga. Bandula was assigned the duty of providing security for Ossie Abeygunasekera's vehicle while riding a motorcycle.On January 27, 1990 on the day of his abduction, Bandula was traveling by bicycle from his home in Dalugama, Kelaniya, to a nearby shop when he was forcibly taken by an armed group. Among the abductors was then Assistant Superintendent of Police Douglas Peiris, who reportedly brandished a firearm.According to the Batalanda Commission report, Peiris threatened Bandula, demanding he get into a vehicle and warning him of imminent harm. Bandula was blindfolded and taken to the Peliyagoda Police Station, then transferred to another vehicle and eventually brought to the Batalanda housing complex, with several tires on him.Bandula was confined to a room, handcuffed to a nearby object, and subjected to severe physical abuse. Two other individuals in the room were blindfolded and bound. Bandula inquired from one of them the reason for his abduction to Batalanda.One of the individuals had previously taken legal action against Assistant Superintendent of Police Douglas Peiris, accusing him of assault.The court found Douglas Peiris guilty and ordered him to pay compensation.Bandula's testimony revealed that after the compensation was paid, the complainant was abducted and taken to the Batalanda torture chamber.During his detention, Bandula was subjected to severe beatings, often being hung upside down and struck with poles.He was moved between several houses, and at one location, police officers informed him that Denzil, Basil, Upali, and Quintus had been abducted and murdered there.One morning, a police officer informed Bandula that his arrest was based on false information and that he would be released. The officer instructed Bandula not to disclose his ordeal to Ossie Abeygunasekera.However, Bandula overheard a conversation outside the building, revealing plans to take him to the Rathgahahawatta Bridge that night, shoot him near the ear, remove his handcuffs, and throw him into the river.Fearing for his life, Bandula escaped by jumping out of a window, climbing over a barbed wire fence, and fleeing to Badugewatta village.There, he sought refuge at a relative's house, where he managed to remove his handcuffs with their help. Bandula then fled to Ossie Abeygunasekera's residence in Colombo.Bandula stayed at Abeygunasekera's house for four months before traveling to Saudi Arabia for his safety. He returned to Sri Lanka in July 1993 and provided a statement to the Criminal Investigation Department in August 1994.Tragically, Ossie Abeygunasekera was killed in a bomb attack targeting Gamini Dissanayake on November 9, 1994.Shouldn't these crimes be thoroughly investigated beyond mere debates?Shouldn't justice be served to the victims, even now?",

However, he highlighted the positive growth of 5 in 2024, marking the first year of recovery after the economic crisis.\"We anticipate that it will take another year or two for the economy to return to its pre-crisis size.

Based on these comments the judge noted that it has led to a perception of bias in the public eye.Translated Excerpt from the High Court Judge's Statement:\"The Registrar of the High Court informed me that Sanath Balasuriya and Poddala Jayanta had made certain statements on Facebook regarding this case and my involvement. Following this notification, I instructed the Registrar to submit a detailed report, which I received on February 18. The report indicated that the statements circulated on Facebook were false. It is necessary to investigate whether these statements have brought disrepute to the judiciary, but it is not appropriate for me to conduct this investigation. Therefore, it is essential for another suitable High Court judge to consider this matter. Additionally, these statements have created a public perception that this court may not deliver fair justice in this case. Although this court has the full capacity to ensure justice is served, I have decided to recuse myself to maintain the integrity of the judicial process. Despite the false nature of these statements, they have influenced public opinion, leading to a belief that justice may not be properly administered by this court. Consequently, I have decided not to continue with this case.\"The case has been referred to Colombo Chief High Court Judge Aditya Patabendige for the appointment of a new judge. Judge Sujith Nishshanka was initially appointed but declined to hear the case due to personal reasons. Consequently, the case will be referred back to Chief Judge Patabendige for the appointment of another suitable judge.",

        "date": "27-03-2025 | 10:37 PM",
        "content": "Colombo High Court Judge Aditya Patabendige today ordered the acquittal of former Assistant Superintendent of Police Kulasiri Udugampola, who was accused of revealing sensitive information about military intelligence officers residing at the Millennium City housing complex.In delivering the verdict, Judge Patabendige stated that the prosecution had failed to prove the charges against Udugampola beyond a reasonable doubt.What Was the Millennium City Incident?On December 5, 2001, the United National Front UNF led by Ranil Wickremesinghe won the general election, defeating President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga's party. A few days after the new government was established, on January 2, 2002, a police team led by Assistant Superintendent of Police ASP Kulasiri Udugampola raided a house at the Millennium City housing complex in Athurugiriya. The raid resulted in the seizure of a cache of weapons and the arrest of several individuals.The raid was conducted under the direction of ASP Udugampola, who was then in charge of the Kandy Police Kennel Division.However, it was later revealed that the raided location was a safe house maintained by the Directorate of Military Intelligence DMI of the Sri Lanka Army, specifically for the Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol LRRP unit.Among those arrested were Captain Mohammed Nilam and five other members of the LRRP unit, along with two civilians.The exposure of the intelligence officers and the safe house led to significant controversy and raised serious concerns about national security. Critics argued that the lives of the military intelligence officers were endangered due to the exposure.What Legal Actions Were Taken?In response to the Millennium City raid, the Attorney General filed 22 charges against ASP Kulasiri Udugampola. These charges included actions detrimental to the security and welfare of the Republic of Sri Lanka, gathering information about military intelligence officers and their operations, and compromising national security.What Was Revealed During the Trial?During the trial, it was revealed that ASP Kulasiri Udugampola had been appointed by the then Inspector General of Police to investigate the infamous Udathalawinna massacre. The massacre, which occurred on December 5, 2001, involved the killing of ten individuals and was linked to former State Defense Minister General Anuruddha Ratwatte.It was disclosed that ASP Udugampola had surrounded the Millennium City housing complex based on information that Chanuka Ratwatte, a son of Anuruddha Ratwatte, was hiding there.High Court Judge Aditya Patabendige, in delivering the verdict, stated that ASP Udugampola had not acted beyond his authority. Transladed Excerpt from the High Court Judge's Verdict:\"It was revealed through evidence that at the time of the raid, ASP Udugampola was unaware that the house he was inspecting was a military safe house. He only learned this after conducting inquiries at the housing complex office, where he discovered that the house was occupied by military personnel. Subsequently, he went to the Narahenpita Military Police Headquarters, obtained assistance from the officers there, and proceeded to inspect the house in Athurugiriya with their support.\"The judge highlighted that the then Secretary of Defense had refused to issue detention orders for the arrested military personnel, indicating that ASP Udugampola had acted in good faith. The judge emphasized that there was no evidence to suggest that Udugampola had disclosed sensitive information that threatened national security.Translated Excerpt:\"In relation to this case, former heads of military intelligence, retired Major Generals Kapila Hendavitharana and Suresh Sallay, along with Staff Sergeant Premananda Udalagama, provided testimony. It appears that their testimonies were given with the intention of protecting the arrested military officers. However, their testimonies did not reveal any evidence necessary to substantiate the charges relevant to this case.\"Despite claims that the raid had endangered several military intelligence personnel, the judge stated that there was no evidence to confirm that sensitive information was disclosed due to Udugampola's actions.The judge also noted that Udugampola had based his investigations on information about a potential attack on a campaign rally of Ranil Wickremesinghe, the leader of the United National Party at the time. Although the prosecution argued that this was hearsay, the judge pointed out that such information had been reported in the media during that period.After analyzing all the presented evidence, the judge concluded that ASP Udugampola's actions were lawful and acquitted him of all charges.SubtitleFormer ASP Kulasiri Udugampola\"After 22 years, justice has been served by an exemplary judge. The judgment was clear and impartial. I have never been accused of any wrongdoing by my superiors and have always performed my duties diligently.\"",

Julie Kozack, Director of the IMF s Communications Department noted reforms in Sri Lanka are bearing fruit. \"Inflation remains low in Sri Lanka. Revenue collection on the fiscal side is improving, and international reserves are continuing to accumulate. Economic growth reached 5 in 2024, and that was after two years of economic contraction. And we do expect the recovery to continue in 2025 in Sri Lanka. These are all very positive developments for Sri Lanka and for the people of Sri Lanka,\" she said in response to a question posed by News 1st's Zulfick Farzan during a press briefing held in Washington DC on Thursday 27. She warned that Sri Lanka's economy still does remain vulnerable, and therefore it is critical that the reform momentum be sustained to ensure that macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability are durably achieved.\" She also added that the International Monetary Fund has made available to Sri Lanka USD 334 Mn, as part of the Extended Fund Facility program. \"So first, let me just step back on Sri Lanka. First, I'll say that on Friday, February 28th, the IMF Executive Board approved the third review under the EFF arrangement for Sri Lanka, and this provided the country with immediate access to 334 million of support. Once the board approved that third review, the 334 million was made available to Sri Lanka to support its economic policies and reforms. And with this 334 million, it brings total financial support from the IMF to Sri Lanka to 1.34 billion,\" she explained.",

A parliamentary debate on the report is scheduled for the 10th of next month. Among the key testimonies is that of former military officer Indrananda de Silva, who provided an eyewitness account of the atrocities committed at the Batalanda torture camp. De Silva claims that Douglas Peiris, a police officer allegedly responsible for these crimes, is still alive and hiding in Sri Lanka, contrary to rumors of his death abroad. De Silva asserts that if Peiris is arrested, it could lead to the apprehension of other key figures involved in these heinous acts, including Ranil Wickremesinghe. He emphasizes that Peiris, who was granted bail by the Court of Appeal, has been evading capture under the guise of being deceased. The report also includes the harrowing account of Thissa Pelipana, who was abducted on January 31, 1989, while serving as a monk. Pelipana was taken to the Batalanda torture camp, where he was brutally interrogated and tortured. He revealed that he was stripped naked, beaten, and burned, and that a female police inspector, Padmini Premalatha, was among those who assaulted him. Pelipana was eventually released after intervention from a senior government politician and later renounced his monastic life. His testimony raises critical questions about the nature of these crimes and the need for justice. As the debate approaches, the public continues to question whether these crimes will be addressed and justice served.",

Paetongtarn Shinawatra was in Phuket province when the tremor rocked the capital. At least a worker was killed and 43 others missing when a building under construction in Bangkok collapsed this afternoon. A viral video clip showed the under-construction building collapsing in Chatuchak district, scattering debris around the area. The Thai Meteorological Department reported that the midday tremor was a shallow one, at a depth of 10 kilometers, with its epicenter in neighboring Myanmar. A viral video clip showed the under-construction building collapsing in Chatuchak district, scattering debris around the area. Another video clip showed water from a rooftop swimming pool of a high-rise condominium splashing down. The tremor could be felt even on the second floor of the Thai PBS World office on Vibhavadi Rangsit Road. Telephone and internet signals were also disrupted during and after the quake. MRT s blue and purple lines in Bangkok suspended their services shortly after the quake. Witnesses said members of communities huddled together to discuss what they described as an unprecedented experience. People evacuated buildings, with even those living in one- or two-story homes running out of their residences and refusing to go back inside. At a Bangkok café, ceiling lights swayed, and many doors opened and closed by themselves. Car drivers said they felt the streets move. It was so scary, one said. I thought my swinging-house syndrome vertigo was coming back to attack me. People called friends and family members to check about their well-beings.

Martinsson, speaking at a forum in Colombo on Thursday 27, reflected on the optimism that existed in the early 2010s regarding Sri Lanka's long-term outlook. He acknowledged the significant criticism faced by the previous administrations but emphasized the need to recognize the impact of unfortunate events in 2019 and 2022. These extreme occurrences, he argued, were unlucky and had a profound effect on the nation's trajectory. \"We are now at a new starting point,\" Martinsson stated. He emphasized that Sri Lanka still possesses the same advantages but has now addressed many systemic imbalances. He highlighted that foreign investors were initially wary of the new administration, considering it a significant risk before the elections. However, the current political stability and market conditions suggest a positive outlook. \"It's not the new India, it's not the new Pakistan, it's not the new Bangladesh, it's Sri Lanka. So it's its own story, but I think it's going to be a good story for the next decade.\" Martinsson expressed confidence in Sri Lanka's unique story, distinct from other countries like India, Pakistan, or Bangladesh. He believes that with careful management and avoiding drastic mistakes, Sri Lanka's market is poised for growth over the next decade.",

        "date": "28-03-2025 | 12:06 PM",
        "content": "Indian External Affairs Minister Dr. Subrahmanyam Jaishankar addressed the concerns raised in the Rajya Sabha regarding the number of Indian fishermen currently in Sri Lankan custody. As of Wednesday 26, there were 86 Indian fishermen detained in Sri Lanka, with 11 more apprehended Thursday 27, bringing the total to 97. Among them, 83 are serving sentences, three are awaiting trial, and 11 have been newly apprehended. Dr. Jaishankar explained that Sri Lanka has two laws governing fisheries: the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act of 1996 and the Fisheries Regulation of Foreign Fishing Boats Act of 1979. Both acts were amended in 2018 and 2023, respectively, to impose stiffer sentences, higher fines, and longer detentions. Many of the detained fishermen are boat owners, skippers, or repeat offenders, which complicates the situation. The Minister highlighted that the root cause of the issue dates back to decisions made in 1974 and 1976 regarding the International Maritime Boundary Line and fishing jurisdictions. He emphasized the government's efforts to engage with Sri Lanka diplomatically to address the humanitarian aspect of the issue. Additionally, through the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana, efforts are being made to equip boats with transponders to minimize inadvertent crossings. Dr. Jaishankar assured that the government is working on diplomatic channels to secure the release of the fishermen and exploring alternative solutions to prevent such situations in the future.",

        "content": "The International Monetary Fund has stressed that it is crucial that Sri Lanka's State-Owned Enterprises or SOEs are managed in a prudent manner to avoid the accumulation of losses or debts that would eventually need to be paid by taxpayers. An IMF Spokesperson responding to a question posed by News 1st's Zulfick Farzan pointed out that Sri Lankan authorities have emphasized their commitment to ensure that these enterprises do not become a burden for the budget or government debt. The spokesperson went on to note that in order to allow the economy grow at its potential it is important to ensure that the consumers of services provided by SOEs receive the best value for the price they are being charged. The spokesperson added that it involves running SOEs in the most efficient manner and ensuring that they are free of corruption. Commitments under the current Extended Fund Facility EFF program also include making SOEs more transparent, in particular by publishing audited financial statements of the 52 largest SOEs in a timely manner, said the spokesperson. On Thursday 27, Sri Lanka's Central Bank Governor advocated for Capital Market expansion to boost the country's economic growth. Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka CBSL, speaking at the Invest Sri Lanka Capital Market Forum 2025 in Colombo, emphasized the importance of expanding the capital market to facilitate the growth and development of state-owned enterprises and large corporates. Dr. Weerasinghe outlined his vision for leveraging public ownership to enhance governance and create diverse investment opportunities for Sri Lankan citizens. Dr. Weerasinghe highlighted the significant assets owned by the Sri Lankan state, developed over decades with taxpayer money. He proposed that listing state-owned enterprises on the capital market would not only provide opportunities for public ownership but also bring essential governance measures into these businesses. \"Offering public ownership while maintaining a certain amount of state ownership is the right move. This will provide more opportunities and foster market developments,\" he stated.",

        "content": "The Batalanda Commission Report, comprising 14,000 pages including annexes and notes, contains numerous hidden details that have remained concealed from the world.During the operation of the Batalanda torture chamber, Ernest Perera served as the Inspector General of Police of Sri Lanka. His testimony is a crucial part of the Batalanda Commission Report.Excerpt from the Batalanda Commission Report:Question:\"Did the political executive, in collaboration with the police, not only suppress genuine terrorists but also use this as a pretext to target their political opponents?\"Ernest PereraFormer Inspector General of Police:\"Yes, there were several such incidents.\"This is part of the testimony given by former IGP Ernest Perera before the Batalanda Commission. According to him, a political witch hunt was carried out under the guise of suppressing the armed struggle of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna JVP.On August 25, 1988, when lawyer Wijeyadasa Liyanarachchi disappeared, Ernest Perera had been in office as IGP for about a month.The former IGP revealed details about this high-profile murder before the commission.Following Liyanarachchi's disappearance, his senior lawyer Ranjith Abeysuriya and others intervened and made inquiries from various parties. The Batalanda Commission Report states that Tangalle Police Superintendent Karavitige Dharmadasa had reportedly claimed that the missing lawyer was in Tangalle police custody, when inquired by the then-Inspector General Of Police.According to Ernest Perera's testimony, on August 31, 1988, at noon, then-Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had made a phone call to him.Excerpt from the Batalanda Commission Report:Lawyer:On Wednesday, August 31, 1988, at noon, Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe instructed me to bring the suspect to the Special Operations Unit in Kelaniya.Former IGP:Yes, that was the outcome of those discussions. I acknowledge that.Lawyer:Did you conceal the truth?Former IGP:He confirmed the decision.Lawyer:Did you have telephone conversations with Ranil Wickremesinghe at that time?Former IGP:Yes.Lawyer:Did Ranil Wickremesinghe request to bring Liyanarachchi to the Sapugaskanda police?Former IGP:Yes.Question:Why did Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe want the suspect brought to Colombo and then handed over to the special unit operating in Kelaniya?Former IGP:After leaving the ministry, Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe called me and instructed to hand over the suspect to the Kelaniya unit. Therefore, I assumed that Ranil Wickremesinghe would inform the Secretary of Defense about this.Excerpt ends.According to the commission report, the former IGP ordered that lawyer Wijeyadasa Liyanarachchi be handed over to Assistant Superintendent of Police Douglas Peiris, who resided in the Batalanda housing complex.The report suspects that Liyanarachchi was taken from Tangalle to the Batalanda torture chamber.On September 2, 1988, at 11 PM, Liyanarachchi was admitted to the emergency unit of Colombo National Hospital in critical condition.He passed away at 12:55 AM in the intensive care unit.Excerpt from the Batalanda Commission Report:\"The post-mortem examination was conducted by Colombo Judicial Medical Officer Dr. L.B. de Alwis. According to his findings, Wijeyadasa Liyanarachchi died due to shock and hemorrhage caused by multiple muscle and skeletal injuries inflicted by blunt weapons.\"Excerpt ends.Why was Wijeyadasa Liyanarachchi, detained in Tangalle, ordered to be taken to Batalanda?Was there a political motive behind the murder of lawyer Wijeyadasa Liyanarachchi?Is it not time to ensure justice for these crimes and prevent them from being buried forever?",

The decision was made after considering the submissions by Assistant Director of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, Sulochana Hettiarachchi.Dasanayake faces three charges based on a complaint filed in 2016 by current Minister and former Uva Provincial Council member Samantha Vidyaratna. The charges relate to financial misconduct during Dasanayake's tenure as Chief Minister of the Uva Province.The MP was arrested on March 27 and remanded until today.The charges involve the withdrawal of six fixed deposit accounts belonging to the Provincial Council, resulting in a loss exceeding Rs 17.3 million, after a state bank refused to sponsor school bags for preschool children.During today's 1 hearing, Assistant Director Sulochana Hettiarachchi stated that a week is needed to record statements from several officials of the relevant state bank. She requested that the suspect be further remanded to prevent potential interference with witnesses.Representing Dasanayake, President's Counsel Kalinga Indatissa, President's Counsel Anuja Premaratne, and Attorneys-at-Law Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, and Madhura Vithanage argued that the arrest in 2025 for a complaint made in 2016, with statements recorded in 2019, was politically motivated. They claimed the withdrawal of the fixed deposits was done under the instructions of the then-Governor and Chief Secretary of the Uva Provincial Council.After considering both sides, the Chief Magistrate ordered Dasanayake to be remanded until April 8 and instructed the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption to complete the investigation within a week.Meanwhile, officers from the Criminal Investigation Department informed the court that, as per previous court orders, they had presented the case against Dasanayake under the Public Property Act before the Badulla Magistrate's Court.They stated that Dasanayake has been named as a suspect in the case and is ordered to appear before the Badulla Magistrate's Court on May 19.The case will be called again on April 8.",

        "date": "01-04-2025 | 5:33 PM",
        "content": "As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi prepares for his official three-day visit to Sri Lanka starting this Friday, discussions have arisen regarding the agreements set to be signed during his stay. Among these agreements, the defense cooperation pact has sparked significant debate. Modi's visit, which will last until Sunday evening, includes plans to sign several agreements related to energy cooperation, digitalization, health, and multi-sectoral assistance. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri recently confirmed these details during a media briefing. Misri stated that the defense cooperation agreement will include provisions for military training and naval collaboration. This has led to concerns from various political factions in Sri Lanka. The Samagi Jana Balawegaya SJB has accused the government of preparing to sign agreements without fulfilling promises made to the public. Tissa Attanayake, a national organizer for the SJB, emphasized the need for transparency and parliamentary approval for such agreements. \"NPP and JVP have always stated that agreements can only be signed by the government or the president for the duration of their contract, which is limited to five years. Any agreement extending beyond this period should be subject to public approval. We demand transparency regarding these agreements.\" Namal Rajapaksa, National Organizer for the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna SLPP, also expressed his views on the matter. \"Prime Minister Modi is visiting Sri Lanka this week. What agreements are being signed? What benefits will Sri Lanka receive? We need clarity on these matters.\" The Sarva Jana Balawegaya has voiced serious concerns about the defense cooperation agreement. \"This is a very dangerous situation. Sri Lanka has never signed a defense agreement with another country before. Such an agreement directly impacts our national security. We urge the government to inform the public and present these agreements to parliament.\" The Frontline Socialist Party has also raised alarms about the defense cooperation agreement. \"This is the first time in Sri Lankan history that a defense agreement is being signed with India. Reports indicate that this agreement aims to counter China's growing military influence,\" said Pubudu Jayagoda, the Education Secretary of the Frontline Socialist Party. However, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri emphasized that the agreement is not new but rather an update to existing cooperation. \"\"If I am not mistaken we are working on an update of an existing agreement on defense cooperation with Sri Lanka and we very much hope that can be concluded during this particular visit.\"",

        "content": "Aid groups in the worst-hit areas of Myanmar said there was an urgent need for shelter, food and water after an earthquake that killed more than 2,700 people, but said the country's civil war could prevent help reaching those in need. The death toll had reached 2,719 and is expected to rise to more than 3,000, Myanmar's military leader Min Aung Hlaing said in a televised address on Tuesday. He said 4,521 people were injured, and 441 were missing. The 7.7 magnitude quake, which hit around lunchtime on Friday, was the strongest to hit the Southeast Asian country in more than a century, toppling ancient pagodas and modern buildings alike. In neighbouring Thailand, rescuers pressed on searching for life in the rubble of a collapsed skyscraper in the capital Bangkok, but acknowledged time was against them. In Myanmar's Mandalay area, 50 children and two teachers were killed when their preschool collapsed, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. \"In the hardest-hit areas...communities struggle to meet their basic needs, such as access to clean water and sanitation, while emergency teams work tirelessly to locate survivors and provide life-saving aid,\" the UN body said in a report. The International Rescue Committee said shelter, food, water and medical help were all needed in places such as Mandalay, near the epicentre of the quake. \"Having lived through the terror of the earthquake, people now fear aftershocks and are sleeping outside on roads or in open fields,\" an IRC worker in Mandalay said in a report. The civil war in Myanmar, where the junta seized power in a coup in 2021, has complicated efforts to reach those injured and made homeless by the Southeast Asian nation's biggest quake in a century. Amnesty International said the junta needed to allow aid to reach areas of the country not under its control. Rebel groups say the junta has conducted airstrikes after the quake.",

This decision was made following his appearance before the Colombo Magistrate's Court this morning. Dasanayake was arrested by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption in connection with financial corruption charges dating back to his tenure as the Chief Minister of the Uva Province. On March 27, Colombo Chief Magistrate Thanuja Lakmali ordered his remand. The court considered three corruption charges against Dasanayake. While he was granted bail for two of the cases, he was remanded in custody for the third. He faces three charges, including causing a loss of Rs. 23 million to the government by withdrawing all fixed deposits maintained by the provincial council from a state bank after the bank manager refused to provide additional funds, for which he was remanded by the court. He faces two other charges from the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption CIABOC. One of the charges involves the misappropriation of Rs. 2.5 million obtained from two state banks, which were allegedly transferred to Dasanayake's foundation's account. Another charge accuses him of directly receiving Rs. 1 million from a state bank, intended for the provincial council, which he reportedly took personally from the bank branch.",

        "date": "02-04-2025 | 5:39 PM",
        "content": "UNP Chairman Vajira Abeywardena speaking in Vavuniya said that Self-Defense is NOT a crime. He made this statement in response to allegations regarding the crimes committed at the Batalanda torture chamber during the 1987-1990 period. \"When a government elected by the people is attacked, the government controls it. It does not belong to murder. This is stated in the constitution, not by me. For example, if someone's life is threatened here and they defend themselves, it is not considered murder. If someone attacks you and you defend yourself, and they die, it is not murder. In English, this is called self-defense, or in Sinhala, 'aatma arakshawa'. Regarding the Batalanda incident, I want to say it is a report of 210 pages. About 150 pages belong to the current government, not us. There is not a single recommendation against Ranil Wickremesinghe,\" he said. Over the past 21 days, News1st revealed detailed mentioned in the Batalanda Commission regarding the crimes that were committed. According to these revelations, various groups were abducted, brought to the Batalanda housing complex, tortured, killed, or disappeared. This raises the question of whether these actions were indeed self-defense, as claimed by Vajira Abeywardena. According to the commission report, Earl Sugi Perera, also known as Sydney, was abducted and detained on March 23, 1990, in a house adjacent to the B7 house where Ranil Wickremesinghe's personal security officer Sudath Chandrasekara lived. In his testimony to the commission, he stated that he saw two people hanging by their legs in the B8 house, with blood flowing from their bodies. On some days, he was dressed in women's clothes and a wig, as revealed in his testimony to the Batalanda Commission. According to Sugi's statement to the commission, after being detained for several days, then-Assistant Police Commissioner Douglas Peiris arrived at the house and assaulted him. After 22 days, he was taken outside in a jeep driven by police officer Douglas Peiris. Batalanda Report Excerpt: On the way, Assistant Police Commissioner Douglas Peiris told Sugi, \"When you go home, you must fulfill a duty for a certain gentleman. If you don't, you will be killed.\" Sugi asked what the duty was, and Peiris replied, \"Your family members know what it is.\" Douglas Peiris's statement indicated that Sugi had to pay 50,000 rupees to lawyer Lakshman Ranasinghe for his release. Is this not a ransom for release from the torture chamber? Former Police Chief Ernest Perera revealed details about this incident in his testimony to the commission. Earl Sugi Perera's father met the then Police Chief to seek help for his son's release. Excerpt from Former Police Chief's Testimony to the Batalanda Commission: Ernest Perera Former Police Chief: \"As I remember, he came and said either Douglas Peiris had taken his son into custody or was about to take him into custody. I don't remember the exact nature of the complaint. What I do remember is that he said they were asking for 50,000 rupees.\" Question: \"What was the 50,000 rupees for?\" Ernest Perera Former Police Chief: \"He said the lawyer told him that if he paid 50,000 rupees, he would release his son if he was in custody, or prevent him from being taken into custody if he wasn't.\" Were these crimes committed in the name of self-defense? Many such incidents have been revealed in the Batalanda Commission report. Shouldn't justice be served for these crimes even now?",

        "date": "02-04-2025 | 4:35 PM",
        "content": "The Colombo High Court has sentenced former North Central Province Chief Minister S.M. Ranjith and his Sister-in-Law, Shanthi Chandrasena, to 16 years of rigorous imprisonment for corruption. The judgement was delivered by Colombo High Court Chief Judge Aditya Patabendi, following a case filed by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. S.M. Ranjith served as the Chief Minister of the North Central Province from September 25, 2012, to January 20, 2015. During this period, he illegally provided over Rs 2.6 million through fuel orders to his personal secretary, Shanthi Chandrasena, despite an existing fuel allowance included in her salary. The Bribery Commission filed the case in November 2021, citing six charges, including the misuse of government resources and coercion of government officials. After a lengthy trial, the judge concluded that the prosecution had proven the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the defendants had misused 16,784 liters of fuel, violating the Bribery Act. Before sentencing, the Bribery Commission's attorney highlighted that S.M. Ranjith, as an elected public representative, had misused public funds in a district with a predominantly farming population. Translation Of Quoted Statement By The Attorney: \"Anuradhapura District is relatively underdeveloped, with the majority of its population being farmers. The defendants, as public representatives in such a region, engaged in corrupt activities by misusing public funds. In 2012, the value of the misused funds exceeded Rs 2.6 million, and their current value is even higher. Your Honor, considering the severity of these charges, we request that the defendants be given appropriate punishments.\" End Of Translation Of Quoted Statement. In defense, Attorney-at-Law Darshana Kuruppu argued that the offense occurred in 2012 and that the defendants had fully cooperated with the trial. He requested leniency in sentencing. Quote From High Court Verdict: \"This case reveals an economic crime. The first defendant, elected as a public representative, is accountable to the public and committed to serving their needs. Corrupt activities have detrimental effects on the country's economy. Recently, our nation faced a severe economic crisis, causing significant hardship for our people. Such corrupt actions contribute to these economic challenges. Therefore, the court cannot show leniency towards public representatives, government officials, and judicial officers facing such charges. They must be given the maximum penalties allowed by law.\" End Of Quote From High Court Verdict. Consequently, the court sentenced both defendants to 16 years of rigorous imprisonment. S.M. Ranjith is the brother of former Minister S.M. Chandrasena, and Shanthi Chandrasena is the wife of S.M. Chandrasena.",

Cheuko gained widespread recognition after social media videos showed him closely watching the crowd to stop potential pitch invaders from harming the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner. \"They don't allow me to be on the field anymore,\" the bodyguard said in an interview with social media channel House of Highlights. \"I was in Europe for seven years, working for Ligue 1 and the Champions League, and only six people invaded the pitch. \"I came to the USA and in just 20 months, 16 people have already done so. There's a huge problem here. I'm not the problem. Let me help Messi.\" An Inter Miami team spokesperson told ESPN it was a club decision, not MLS', to not have Cheuko on the sidelines. However, he remains an employee of the club and part of the security detail. Major League Soccer said earlier on Tuesday that its protocols regarding team security guards had not changed and multiple sides had designated team security guards that are stationed near team benches on the field.

Additionally, the committee is empowered to seek the assistance of any officer or expert deemed necessary for their expertise in the relevant field. On March 24th 2025, the UK imposed sanctions on Former Sri Lanka Army Commanders General Shavendra Silva General Jagath Jayasuriya, Admiral Of The Fleet Wasantha Karannagoda and Former LTTE Military Commander Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan also known as Karuna Amman, for serious human rights violations. \"The UK government has imposed sanctions on 4 individuals responsible for serious human rights abuses and violations during the Sri Lanka civil war, including extrajudicial killings, torture and or perpetration of sexual violence,\" said a statement from the UK Government, adding \"The individuals sanctioned by the UK today include former senior Sri Lankan military commanders, and a former LTTE military commander who later led the paramilitary Karuna Group, operating on behalf of the Sri Lankan military against the LTTE.\" It added that the measures, which include UK travel bans and asset freezes, target individuals responsible for a range of violations and abuses, such as extrajudicial killings, during the civil war. Two days later, on March 26, Sri Lanka's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment Tourism said that unilateral actions by the UK government to impose sanctions on three former military commanders complicate the national reconciliation process underway in Sri Lanka. It added that the government is actively strengthening domestic mechanisms for accountability and reconciliation, asserting that any past human rights violations should be addressed through these domestic channels.",

        "content": "The Committee on Public Enterprises COPE discovered that the roof design for the new passenger terminal at Katunayake Airport has been subject to multiple changes with each successive government. The COPE's findings were disclosed during a recent meeting with the Airport and Aviation Services Sri Lanka Limited.The controversy centers around proposals from different administrations to alter the roof design to reflect their political symbols. One government proposed a design resembling the lotus flower, while another suggested a design inspired by the araliya leaf.COPE summoned officials from the Airport and Aviation Services Sri Lanka Limited to discuss the ongoing expansion project aimed at increasing the airport's passenger capacity.Dr. Nishantha Samarawickrama, Chairman of the COPE Committee, highlighted the desire to increase the passenger capacity of Bandaranaike International Airport. Cabinet approval was granted in 2007 to expand the capacity from 6 million to 12 million passengers.In 2013, discussions were held to further increase the capacity to 15 million passengers. During the first four years, 344.5 million rupees were paid to a consulting firm for planning and design.Hasitha Karunaratne, Head of Projects at Airport and Aviation Services Sri Lanka Limited, explained that to apply for the JICA loan in 2012, the estimate and design needed to be prepared a year in advance. The initial design was approved by the Cabinet, and the loan was obtained. However, the project was halted midway.Despite the decision to increase the capacity to 15 million, the same consulting firm continues to provide advisory services. This decision has raised questions about the selection process and the efficiency of the project management.W.P.C. Wickramaratne, Auditor General, revealed that the former Minister of Ports and Aviation signed the document recommending the selection of this consulting firm.If a competitive bidding process was considered in 2009, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation JBIC funds could have been utilized more efficiently.Dr. Nishantha Samarawickrama pointed out that the consulting services were deliberately awarded to this firm. In 2014, a new agreement was signed, extending the consulting services for 47 months at a cost of 1.36 billion Japanese yen, equivalent to 519 million Sri Lankan rupees. The previous expenditure of 344.5 million rupees over four years seems to have been wasted.MP Asitha Niroshan Egodawithana, a member of COPE, questioned why the old firm was selected again in such a hurry. Hasitha Karunaratne, Head of Projects at Airport and Aviation Services Sri Lanka Limited responded that there were changes to the roof design.Dr. Nishantha Samarawickrama emphasized that due to the lack of initial planning, the previous expenditure of 344.5 million rupees has been wasted.MP Asitha Niroshan Egodawithana noted that the roof design changes reflect the political preferences of different administrations.Initially, it was the lotus flower, then it changed to the araliya leaf. Public funds and loans have been used to satisfy political whims.The project is still incomplete as of 2025.",

I was then held at the Peliyagoda police station for several months. On February 15, 1991, I was released without any charges after paying a bribe of 50,000 rupees. Later, I had to pay an additional 25,000 rupees to obtain the necessary documents to resume my job.\"Previously, Earl Sugi Perera, also known as Sydney, was similarly abducted and extorted for money.Senior Police Officer S.C. Pathirana submitted this letter to the Commission, revealing the demand for a 50,000 rupee ransom.These abductions and extortion incidents occurred during the same period when Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera was assassinated.Were these abductions and extortions carried out for personal gain or self-defense?We continue to question whether these incidents will be thoroughly investigated and justice served to the victims.",

That is not considered murder. This is not my statement; it is stated in the constitution. For example, if someone's life is in danger and they defend themselves, it is not considered murder. If someone attacks you and you defend yourself, resulting in their death, it is not murder. This is called self-defense.\" said Vajira Abeywardena, the Chairman of the United National Party on Wednesday 2.Minister of Fisheries Ramalingam Chandrasekar launched a scathing critique against the United National Party UNP leadership, specifically on its chairman, Vajira Abeywardena, and former President Ranil Wickremesinghe.Chandrasekar accused Wickremesinghe of being responsible for the atrocities committed during the 1987-1989 period, alleging that he was involved in the deaths of thousands of young people.He further claimed that Wickremesinghe's actions led to the deaths of over 60,000 young men and women during that period.The Minister emphasized the pain and suffering experienced by the families of the victims, stating, \"These were our own people, and we feel their pain deeply. We understand their suffering.\" He warned that if the law is properly enforced, several UNP members might face imprisonment, including Wickremesinghe himself.",

        "date": "03-04-2025 | 7:45 PM",
        "content": "In a move to address trade imbalances, US President Donald Trump announced the imposition of sweeping tariffs on some of the country's largest trading partners. The new tariffs include a 10 universal tariff on all imported foreign goods, effective April 5th, and \"reciprocal tariffs\" ranging from 20 to over 40 on dozens of countries, starting April 9th.During an address to automotive industry professionals in the Rose Garden on April 2nd, President Trump emphasized the need to rectify what he described as unfair trade advantages held by other countries. \"Other countries gain significant advantages in trade deals with the United States. To immediately address this imbalance, we are implementing a new policy of reciprocal tariffs to ensure that the US economy benefits more from these trade relationships,\" Trump stated.The President's decision fulfills a key campaign promise to raise US taxes on foreign goods, aiming to narrow the gap with the tariffs that the White House claims other countries unfairly impose on US products.The full text of the executive order has been published on the official White House website. According to the order, a 10 tariff will be imposed on all goods imported into the United States starting April 5th. Additionally, the increased reciprocal tariffs will be implemented from April 9th.President Trump highlighted that Sri Lanka imposes an 88 tariff on goods imported from the United States. In response, the new executive decision stipulates that the United States will impose a 44 tariff on goods imported from Sri Lanka.Dhananath Fernando, CEO of the Advocata Institute, explained the rationale behind the reciprocal tariff. \"The reciprocal tariff has been calculated based on the trade balance between Sri Lanka and the US. President Trump mentioned that if someone imposes a tariff on US products, the US will charge the same or half of it in this case against the other country,\" Fernando stated.The highest tariffs have been imposed on China, with a rate of 34. Other key trading partners affected include:- European Union: 20 - Israel: 17 - India: 26 - Bangladesh: 37 - Myanmar: 44 - Indonesia: 32 - Laos: 48 - Thailand: 36 - Cambodia: 49 - Madagascar: 47 In 2024, 23 of Sri Lanka's total exports were to the United States, with 70 of these exports being apparel. The total revenue from exports to the US amounted to USD 3 billion, with over USD 2 billion coming from apparel. While the maximum tariff is set at 44, the rates may vary for different products. Similar tariffs have been imposed on other countries competing with Sri Lanka in the apparel industry.President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has appointed a committee to study the potential challenges arising from the tariffs and provide recommendations to the government. The committee includes key officials from the Ministry of Finance, Central Bank, Board of Investment, Export Development Board, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Diplomatic discussions have also been initiated to mitigate the challenges posed by the new tariffs.",

China firmly opposes this and will resolutely take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests, China s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement Thursday morning.The ministry slammed the move that stands as a centerpiece in Trump s effort to reshape the rules of international trade as typical unilateral bullying practice, while urging the US to cancel the tariffs and properly resolve differences with its trading partners through equal dialogue. The United States has drawn the so-called reciprocal tariffs based on subjective and unilateral assessments, which is inconsistent with international trade rules and seriously damages the legitimate rights and interests of relevant parties, the statement said.Trump s announcement Wednesday adds 34 so-called reciprocal tariffs to existing 20 duties on all Chinese imports to the US. Since returning to power in January, Trump had already levied two tranches of 10 additional duties on all Chinese imports, which the White House said was necessary to stem the flow of illicit fentanyl from the country to the US.Beijing responded to those levies swiftly, but moderately, imposing retaliatory tariffs on a range of US imports including agricultural products and fuel, while taking action against certain American firms and ramping up export controls. I have great respect for President Xi Jinping of China, great respect for China, but they were taking tremendous advantage of us, Trump said during his roughly hour-long address in the White House s Rose Garden on Wednesday. They understand exactly what s happening and they re going to fight. Trump separately announced an additional 10 duties on all imports to the US and a host of country-specific measures that hit Asian countries particularly hard - rattlling markets and businesses across the world.",

He was taken to a house in the Batalanda housing complex, where he endured various forms of torture. On some days, he was forced to wear women's clothing and wigs.In his own words, Perera described the ordeal: \"They beat me, they beat me. Douglas Peiris and his sons would come during the day, claiming to learn karate from us while beating us. We were given one meal a day and told to eat it or face more beatings. Douglas Peiris would say Ranil is coming, the boss is coming, and those in his escort group would kick us.\"Perera was held for nearly a month before being released after a ransom was demanded. He recounted, \"On the 13th, a Friday in 1990, they brought me to the seventh post and asked my father to fulfill a duty. They handed me a piece of paper and I contacted Lakshman Ranasinghe. On April 14, 1990, I went to his house early in the morning, begging for forgiveness and offering money. I was eventually released after paying 50,000 rupees, which is worth millions today.

        "content": "CNN China said on Friday it will impose reciprocal 34 tariffs on all imports from the United States from April 10, making good on a promise to strike back after US President Donald Trump escalated a global trade war.On Wednesday, Trump unveiled an additional 34 tariffs on all Chinese goods imported into the US, in a move poised to cause a major reset of relations and worsen trade tension between the world s two largest economies. This practice of the US is not in line with international trade rules, seriously undermines China s legitimate rights and interests, and is a typical unilateral bullying practice, China s State Council Tariff Commission said in a statement announcing its retaliatory tariffs. Since returning to power in January, Trump had already levied two tranches of 10 additional duties on all Chinese imports, which the White House said was necessary to stem the flow of illicit fentanyl from the country to the US. That means Chinese goods arriving in the US would be effectively subject to 54 tariffs.China s retaliation against the latest round of US tariffs are more sweeping than its earlier reciprocal actions. Beijing had responded to those previous levies swiftly, but moderately, imposing retaliatory tariffs on targeted US imports including agricultural products and fuel, while taking action against certain American firms and ramping up export controls.The 54 tariffs are higher than what many analysts had expected and could fundamentally reshape relations, and roughly half a trillion dollars in trade, between the two economies after decades of interdependence.As part of the retaliatory measures announced Friday, when hundreds of millions of people in China celebrated a major public holiday, the country also added 11 American companies to its unreliable entity list, including drone manufacturers, and put export controls on 16 American companies to prohibit the export of Chinese dual-use items.The Commerce Ministry announced anti-dumping investigations into imported medical CT X-ray tubes originating from the United States and India.In addition, Beijing also unveiled export controls on seven types of rare-earth minerals to the US, including samarium, gadolinium and terbium.The challenges are multifold for businesses with supply chains rooted in China, which are now left scrambling as they face not only the unexpectedly high US levies on Chinese imports, but also on other Asian countries due to Trump s broad-based tariffs.The tariffs also come at a challenging time for China s own slowing economy, with officials in recent weeks ramping up efforts to spur weak domestic consumption as they braced for the widening trade war.US stock futures plunged Friday after China announced it would retaliate. Dow futures fell 1,000 points, or 2.3. The broader S P 500 was set to open 2.4 lower and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was on pace to start the day 2.7 lower. European and UK stocks were down more than 3 Friday, on pace for their worst performance in years.Markets have been on edge for days: On Thursday, the Dow fell more than 1,600 points, or nearly 4. The S P 500 fell nearly 5 and the Nasdaq plunged nearly 6. Each major US index recorded its worst performance in about five years, since the pandemic.",

Asian markets had also declined earlier.The sweeping new tariffs announced by President Donald Trump on Wednesday 2 triggered a slump in global stock markets, with the US S P 500 having its worst day since the impact of Covid in 2020.Traders are concerned the tariffs will increase prices and weigh on growth in the US and abroad.Trump told reporters on Thursday he thought things were going \"very well\", adding: \"The markets are going to boom.\"But on Friday markets continued to slide, with Germany's Dax index down more than 1.Trump has said the tariffs will boost US economic growth, but some economists have warned of a slowdown in the US and in the global economy.The managing director of the International Monetary Fund IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, has said the new tariffs \"clearly represent a significant risk to the global outlook at a time of sluggish growth\".She said the IMF was still looking into the \"macroeconomic implications\" of the measures and stressed the need to avoid actions that could do more damage to the global economy.",

With the US accounting for approximately USD 3 billion in exports and 25 of Sri Lanka s total merchandise exports, this development poses a significant challenge to the country s trade and economic stability. The Chamber highlighted that broader global trade disruptions could further slow economic growth, affecting overall demand in key export markets such as the US and the EU.The Chamber appreciates the President's initiative to set up a committee to evaluate the impact of the US tariffs and provide solutions to mitigate potential risks to the export sector.It added that given that Sri Lanka is halfway through the IMF Extended Fund Facility programme and navigating a tight fiscal space, it is crucial for the country to negotiate down from the high tariff band. The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce said that this situation presents an opportune moment for the Government to reassess its tariff structure and implement measures to improve trade facilitation and the ease of doing business.The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce said that it remains committed to working closely with the Government to develop a coordinated and strategic response to mitigate the potential economic impact of these tariffs. The Chamber urges all stakeholders to collaborate in safeguarding Sri Lanka s trade interests while actively pursuing diplomatic and policy-driven solutions to sustain and strengthen the export sector.",

        "content": "Sri Lanka s apparel industry has voiced its concern over the Reciprocal Tariff policy announced by the U.S. administration. The newly proposed tariffs could significantly disrupt the country s largest export sector and jeopardize thousands of jobs, said the Joint Apparel Association Forum.Following the announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump on April 2, a 10 baseline tariff on all imports will take effect from April 5, escalating to a 44 reciprocal tariff on Sri Lankan exports starting April 9. This tariff level is extremely high relative to our regional competitors, stated Yohan Lawrence, Secretary General of the Joint Apparel Association Forum JAAF. Sri Lanka could very quickly see its share of U.S. business move to countries with lower tariffs than Sri Lanka has. The United States is Sri Lanka s largest single-country apparel market, accounting for over 40 of the sector s total exports, which exceeded USD 5.5 billion in 2023. Yohan Lawrence warned that the swift implementation of these tariffs could lead to a severe and immediate impact, potentially causing the bulk of U.S. business to migrate to competitor markets. This volume of business simply cannot be replaced through other markets, he added.The Government of Sri Lanka has already initiated consultations with the industry and other stakeholders to determine an appropriate course of action. We are very appreciative of the immediate actions taken by the Government to discuss this situation and are working very closely with the authorities to see how best we could address the concerns raised by the U.S. Government, whilst staying within the limitations of Sri Lanka s ongoing IMF programme, said Lawrence.Despite this challenge, the apparel sector remains committed to transparency, ethical production, and sustainable value creation. Our focus now is on engagement, agility, and ensuring Sri Lanka remains a trusted sourcing destination, Lawrence emphasized. However, this situation is serious, and it must be addressed as a matter of national urgency.",

No one can act against the law under the guise of their uniform, hoping for promotions and various privileges.\" End of Excerpt.This statement was made by the Gampaha High Court judge while sentencing five police officers, including Douglas Peiris, to severe imprisonment for the abduction and detention of two brothers from the same family at the Batalanda torture chamber.Douglas Peiris was the head of the Kelaniya Anti-Subversive Unit at the time.His promotions are considered the longest leap in police history.A special Cabinet paper was used for granting those promotions.It was presented jointly by the then President and the State Defense Minister.At the Presidential Commission it was revealed that Douglas Peiris, who faced numerous charges including murder, abduction, and extortion, was rapidly promoted due to his qualification of \"eliminating subversive individuals.\"The term \"eliminating subversive individuals\" was revealed by the Commission to mean the extrajudicial killing of individuals.Excerpt of Former IGP Ernest Perera's statement before the Commission:Lawyer: Mr. Nalin Delgoda says that Mr. Douglas Peiris acted to curb the growth of the terrorist movement by eliminating terrorist suspects.Former IGP: This is a general statement; it might be a brief expression of Mr. Delgoda's thoughts.Lawyer: What do you mean by this?Former IGP: Elimination means suppressing terrorist activities outside the mechanism of justice.The Presidential Commission revealed that the Batalanda torture chamber was used for abducting various individuals and extorting them.Douglas Peiris has been sentenced to five years in prison, but only for the charge of abduction with the intent to kill.The judicial process is still ongoing.What is the obstacle to initiating a thorough investigation and bringing those involved in these crimes to justice?When will justice be served?",

Herath emphasized that the agreement is a Memorandum Of Understanding on defense cooperation between the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and the Republic of India, rather than a formal defense pact. \"This is an understanding on defense cooperation, not a defense agreement. It clearly states that any cooperative activities under this agreement must respect the sovereignty, equality, and territorial integrity of both nations, and must not interfere in internal affairs,\" Herath explained.The agreement includes provisions for joint training exercises, information sharing on human trafficking and drug mafias, and other cooperative programs. \"We have agreed to move forward with training exercises and cooperative programs, as well as sharing information on human trafficking and drug mafias. However, we have not agreed to any other defense commitments with India,\" he added.Herath assured that Sri Lanka's territory would not be used in a manner that threatens India's security, and this assurance has also been extended to China. \"We have clearly stated to both India and China that Sri Lanka's territory will not be used for activities that threaten their security. This is a policy we uphold,\" he said.The Minister also emphasized that the agreement does not pose any threat to Sri Lanka's security or sovereignty. \"We assure the people that this understanding does not compromise our security or sovereignty. It is not a binding commitment,\" he stated.Herath reiterated that the details of the agreement are accessible to the public under the Right to Information Act. \"This is not a secret agreement. The public can request information under the Right to Information Act,\" he assured.The National People's Power NPP party, which has fought for the country's territorial integrity and independence, guarantees that no country can buy or subjugate Sri Lanka. \"We assure the people that no country can buy or subjugate us.

Namal Rajapaksa is the National Organizer of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna SLPP and was speaking at the Rising Bharat Summit 2025 in New Delhi.His remarks came in the wake of Prime Minister Modi's visit to Sri Lanka, where Modi pledged support to Colombo in dealing with the Trump tariffs.Rajapaksa highlighted the potential benefits of enhanced cooperation between Sri Lanka and India, emphasizing the importance of regional partnerships. \"With Prime Minister Modi's visit to Sri Lanka, there are many areas where Sri Lanka and India can collaborate, especially in regional cooperation. It's in the best interest of each country to build strong regional ties,\" Rajapaksa stated.He noted that while global orders have often taken precedence, focusing on regional partners like India, which is now one of the largest and fastest-growing economies, could yield significant advantages. \"Countries like Sri Lanka, Maldives, and others in the region can benefit greatly if we pursue the right path and establish effective contracts,\" he added.When asked about the right path for Sri Lanka, given the recent economic and political challenges, Rajapaksa stressed the need for timely implementation of necessary projects.\"We must execute what needs to be done at the right time. Delays in projects like Sampur and Uma Oya due to political reasons led to an energy crisis that later turned into a financial crisis in 2022,\" he explained.Rajapaksa called for regional collaboration, particularly among Indian Ocean countries, to build new trade partnerships. \"The recent developments in Washington will affect Sri Lanka's apparel exports and maritime industry. We need to work together with countries like India to form new alliances and partnerships within the region,\" he said.",

The review analyzed Sri Lanka's current import profile from the United States and the global performance of US exports, revealing that most US goods are already subject to certain para tariffs.The Embassy engaged with the US Trade Representative Office, where Brendan Lynch, Assistant US Trade Representative for South and Central Asia, and Emily Ashby, Director of South Asia, participated in discussions and responded promptly to the executive action.Following this announcement, a report was submitted, and the President of Sri Lanka appointed a special committee comprising industry experts and government officials, including two deputy ministers, to examine the situation and propose possible actions, he said.Several local meetings were conducted, and a virtual discussion with US Trade Representatives explored potential options and mitigation strategies to reduce the trade deficit. Despite the high tariff rates, the calculation is based on the trade deficit divided by corresponding imports, necessitating proposals focused on reducing this gap.The Deputy Minister said that a report is being prepared, and another virtual discussion with the US Trade Representative Office is scheduled for tonight. The President of Sri Lanka directly wrote to US President Donald Trump, outlining possible mitigation measures and requesting collaboration to reduce the tariffs. The White House has acknowledged receipt of this letter, he noted.Contrary to views expressed on social media, the government has taken appropriate action, said the Deputy Minister adding that this situation is not limited to Sri Lanka and the US but is a global issue.

This revelation was recorded in the Batalanda Commission Report.The Batalanda housing complex, originally under the purview of the Government Fertilizer Corporation, became a site of illegal detentions and torture.During the Batalanda Presidential Commission, significant details emerged about the misuse of the housing complex. At the time, Ranil Wickremesinghe was the Minister of Industries, and the complex was under the Ministry of Industries.According to the commission's findings, houses labeled A2 2, A2 1, A2 3, A1 7, B2, B1, and B7 were used by Wickremesinghe.Additionally, houses in the complex were allocated to a police team led by Douglas Peiris, the then OIC of Peliyagoda Police.Thirteen houses were designated for officers of the Kelaniya Anti-Riot Unit. The report revealed that these allocations were made under Wickremesinghe's instructions and orders. However, some houses were occupied only nominally.Former IGP Ernest Perera testified before the commission, expressing surprise that Nalin Delgoda, who had a private residence, was allocated a house in the complex but never resided there.The commission uncovered that the allocation of houses to police officers was done improperly.There was no official documentation from the police headquarters or Kelaniya division to support the lawful acquisition of these houses.Former IGP Perera suggested that these allocations might have been based on private transactions. The commission further questioned whether the improper allocation of houses facilitated the operation of illegal detention centers and torture chambers.Perera acknowledged that the misuse of the housing complex for such purposes was indeed possible. The pressing need now is to ensure justice is served.",

        "content": "US President Donald Trump recently announced two significant tariff decisions, which are expected to have far-reaching impacts on global trade and economic stability.On April 5, the President declared that a 10 tariff would be imposed on all goods imported into the United States from every country. Additionally, starting April 9, tariffs ranging from 10 to 60 will be applied to goods from several other countries. The US President justified these measures as necessary to address trade imbalances and ensure fair competition.In a notable move, the President imposed a 34 tariff on Chinese goods, citing the need to rectify the trade disparities between the two nations. China, which had already been subjected to various tariffs and sanctions by the US, responded immediately by imposing a reciprocal 34 tariff on American goods.The US President took to the social media platform Truth Social to address China's response, stating, If China does not withdraw its 34 increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose additional tariffs on China of 50, effective April 9th, China s government says it will fight to the end if the US continues to escalate the trade war, after Donald Trump threatened huge additional tariffs in response to China s retaliatory measures.On Tuesday, China s commerce ministry accused the US of blackmail and said the US president s threats of additional 50 tariffs if Beijing did not reverse its own 34 reciprocal tariff were a mistake on top of a mistake.It vowed to resolutely take countermeasures, adding: China will fight to the end if the US side is bent on going down the wrong path..The escalating trade tensions have had immediate effects on the global economy. Major stock markets around the world experienced significant declines, with leading indices such as the S P 500 and FTSE 100 reporting substantial drops. The S P 500 index fell by nearly 20 from its recent peak, while the FTSE 100 saw a 7 decline.Despite the overall downturn, some Asian markets showed resilience. Japan's Nikkei 225 index reported a 6 increase, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index grew by 1.7. The Colombo Stock Exchange also saw positive growth, with the All Share Price Index rising by 3.19 and the S P SL20 index increasing by 4.54.Economic analysts attribute the growth in Asian markets to China's swift response to the US tariffs. Meanwhile, the US Treasury Secretary announced that the White House is prepared to hold meaningful discussions with over 50 countries that have responded positively to the tariffs.",

In reality, there is global turmoil regarding these tariffs. Stock markets in several countries have crashed. Every country is taking measures to address this situation.\" He further explained that the government had already presented decisions in the budget on how to review the tax policy and diversify export markets. \"We are discussing how to diversify our export markets instead of relying on a single country.

Instead, a comprehensive and positive transformation across all sectors is necessary for national progress.The President further emphasized that new police officers carry the responsibility of meeting public expectations. He called on them to ensure public safety and security and to prevent the nation from falling prey to organized crime and drug-related issues.He also stated that the younger generation must take responsibility for the motherland, bearing that duty on their shoulders and should strive to steer both their personal future and the future of the country in a positive direction.President Disanayake concluded by saying that joining the regular service of the Sri Lanka Police today should be remembered by all as a significant and powerful step forward.The President further noted that the service rendered by the Special Task Force STF on behalf of the public during times of emergency and disaster is highly commendable.A total of 118 newly recruited Sub-Inspectors and 231 Probationary Police Constables who successfully completed their basic training graduated during the ceremony.President Anura Kumara Disanayake awarded certificates and honours to officers who demonstrated exceptional performance during the training programme.A commemorative token was also presented to President Disanayake, who attended the ceremony as the Chief Guest.An operational demonstration by STF officers on a simulated battlefield was presented as part of the event.Established in 1983 under the theme Victory is Certain, the Sri Lanka Police Special Task Force is currently recognized as a prestigious unit deployed for VIP protection, crime and organized crime suppression and narcotics control efforts aimed at building a drug-free nation.The ceremony was attended by Minister of Public Security and Parliamentary Affairs Ananda Wijepala, Minister of Health and Mass Media Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa, Deputy Minister of Public Security Sunil Watagala, Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security Ravi Seneviratne, Acting Inspector General of Police Priyantha Weerasooriya, STF Commanding Officer Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police Samantha de Silva, along with other senior police officers, the parents of graduating officers and other invitees.Source: PMD",

China s Office of the Tariff Commission of the State Council said that tariffs on U.S. goods will rise to 84 from 34 starting on April 10, according to a translation of the announcement. This comes after the latest U.S. tariff hike which brings levies on Chinese goods to more than 100 took effect at the start of April 9. The repeated escalation of the tariffs threatens to bring trade between two of the world s most important economies to a standstill. The Trump administration announced a sweeping new tariff policy last week, and warned other countries not to retaliate. Some nations, including Japan, have seemed willing to negotiate on tariffs, but China appears to be taking a more hardline stance. The U.S. had already imposed new tariffs on China before it rolled out its full trade policy in April. China, along with Canada and Mexico, was hit with new levies earlier in Trump s presidency as part of what the administration says was an effort to stop fentanyl from entering the U.S. Source: CNBC",

The debate is scheduled to continue on a date in May.\"Our approach is twofold. It is not just about Batalanda; we also need to address the issue related to Rohana Wijeweera. However, we are not doing this out of a desire for revenge. Our primary focus is on reconciliation, unity, and coexistence. Similar to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, we aim to ensure that the main perpetrators are brought to justice through the legal system. We will conduct all possible investigations within the law to hold Ranil Wickremesinghe accountable for his actions and ensure that these murderers are punished, even if it is at the end of their lives.\"Minister Rathnayake emphasized the importance of punishing the main perpetrators, stating, \"It is crucial to remember that the recommendations of the South African Truth Commission were to punish the main perpetrators. No matter how much reconciliation we achieve, it will not be complete if the main murderers remain free. Just as a child who has been abused cannot find peace until the abuser is imprisoned, the same applies to these heinous criminals like Ranil Wickremesinghe. There are films documenting the torture and killings inflicted on people. These brutal torturers must be exposed and written into the history of our country. We must ensure that such individuals are never allowed to hold public office in Sri Lanka again.\"He noted, \"Therefore, our goal is to bring justice to all victims, not just those related to Batalanda. This includes addressing crimes in the North and East. We hope that by the next debate, the President will have appointed an investigative committee to look into these matters. We believe that the President will appoint a competent team for this purpose. Based on their findings, we will inform the Attorney General and proceed through legal channels. We are committed to ensuring justice for the mothers who kept their doors open every night, hoping their sons would return. We will bring justice to the North, South, and East.\"Minister Rathnayake stated, \"We acknowledge that the Batalanda Commission Report is being debated here today. We are having this discussion now because it has suddenly come into public discourse. People in the North are asking if we are only talking about Batalanda and not addressing the massacres that occurred in the North from both sides. They know the crimes committed by the EPDP, the LTTE, and the Sri Lankan security forces. We are aware of these atrocities.\"He continued, \"Therefore, I want to inform you that our approach and plans are aimed at achieving full reconciliation and coexistence by the end of this year or early next year. We are also drafting a new constitution. We acknowledge that these shortcomings have occurred under the Sri Lankan government. We believe that, like many other countries at such moments, our President will apologize on behalf of the nation to the people and parents affected by these crimes, ensuring that Sri Lanka will never again become a bloodbath.\"",

Specifically, the Batalanda torture chamber was under the command of SP Douglas Peiris, who failed the ASP exam three times.

In connection with this incident, a warrant was issued for Inspector General of Police Deshabandu Tennakoon. On March 19, Tennakoon surrendered to the Matara Magistrate's Court through his lawyers by filing a motion.Since then, Tennakoon had been in remand custody and was brought to the Matara Magistrate's Court under heavy security.Although the bail order was scheduled to be announced in the morning, the Magistrate postponed the announcement twice due to technical issues.Finally, at around 2:30 PM, the Magistrate issued the bail order.Translated Excerpt From Bail Order:\"The court has taken into consideration the significant time spent investigating the first suspect. Accordingly, the court acknowledges this fact. Furthermore, the period the suspect has spent in remand custody and the possibility of conducting further investigations without the suspect being in remand custody have been considered. The court also recognizes that the right to bail granted to other suspects in the case is applicable to the first suspect. Therefore, the court orders the release of the suspect on two personal bails of one million rupees each.\"End of Translated Excerpt From Bail Order.Additional Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris, representing the Attorney General, strongly opposed the bail.Translated Excerpt:\"A proposal with 27 charges to remove him from the position of IGP has already been submitted to Parliament, most of which are related to this case. His release would intimidate the witnesses. Granting him bail would severely prejudice the investigation. I firmly state that he will attempt to destroy the investigation in the future. I cannot allow this to happen.\"End of Translated Excerpt.Additional Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris revealed concerns about witness intimidation during the proceedings.Translated Excerpt:\"I need to conduct a thorough study of this bail order and present arguments for its revision. Deputy Inspector General Nishantha Soysa, who made a special revelation with regard to this incident, has reported threats from the first suspect, requesting protection for his life. This is the first time in my career that I have heard of a Deputy Inspector General requesting life protection from a court. Therefore, Your Honor, I must emphasize that the suspect is a dangerous criminal.\"End of Translated Excerpt.President's Counsel Shanaka Ranasinghe, representing the suspect, countered these claims.Translated Excerpt:\"Your Honor, this effort is aimed at prejudicing the court against my client. If the Deputy Inspector General had received threats, why did he wait until the investigators found him? He should have reported this to the court. Furthermore, my client has received death threats. I request special protection for him until he leaves the court premises and permission for his vehicle to enter the court premises.\"End of Translated Excerpt.Additional Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris strongly opposed the request for special protection.Translated Excerpt:\"He is trying to create a spectacle by leaving with a squad after being granted bail. Did he come to court with security? He didn't need protection while hiding for twenty days, jumping over walls. Let him leave the way he came.\"End of Translated Excerpt.The Magistrate rejected the request for special protection for the suspect.Translated Excerpt:\"I reject the request made by the lawyers for special protection for the suspect within the court premises. The suspect is entitled to the same protection as any other individual within the court premises. Therefore, there is no need for special protection.\"End of Translated Excerpt.After being granted bail, Deshabandu Tennakoon got into a car inside the court premises, and left.The case is scheduled to be called again on May 22.",

        "date": "10-04-2025 | 3:39 PM",
        "content": "The Asian Development Bank ADB has outlined the significant policy challenges Sri Lanka faces in reducing its medium-term debt vulnerability in its April 2025 Outlook report.Despite recent progress, the country s debt vulnerability remains high, necessitating continued efforts to build external and fiscal buffers.Sri Lanka's public debt to GDP ratio surged to 126 in 2022 due to substantial borrowing to finance large fiscal deficits, deep tax cuts, rupee depreciation, and borrowing by state-owned enterprises. However, since 2022, the debt-to-GDP ratio has been on a downward trajectory, supported by rupee appreciation, fiscal discipline, and debt restructuring. The ADB projects that debt will continue to decline as a percentage of GDP amid ongoing economic stabilization and recovery, combined with a projected decrease in gross financing needs and cuts in interest rates under debt restructuring.Despite these positive developments, the International Monetary Fund's IMF sovereign risk and debt sustainability analysis SRDSA indicates that reducing debt to a sustainable level will take time.The SRDSA targets a public debt to GDP ratio below 95 only by 2032, assuming the successful completion of an IMF program in 2027 and full implementation of debt restructuring. High debt sustainability risks will continue to impede growth and investment for many years. The ADB outlook noted that fiscal relief from debt restructuring has supported cash flow management but is expected to wane starting in 2028. Debt service will increase significantly during 2028 2038, when restructured international sovereign bonds are scheduled for repayment, potentially crowding out growth-enhancing spending on infrastructure and investment in human capital.To address these challenges and avoid distress, Sri Lanka must sustain efforts to build up external and fiscal buffers. Deep fiscal reforms are necessary but not sufficient to mitigate debt risks. The country needs to secure new external financing, including concessional terms, and continue rebuilding its gross international reserves through a current account surplus and other inflows that do not add to the debt burden.Structural reforms are essential to stay on a growth-friendly path that generates non-debt inflows. The government has started developing a trade liberalization agenda, aiming to formulate a national export development plan for 2025 2029, introduce a national tariff policy to create a simple, transparent, and predictable tariff framework, and expand free trade agreements.",

        "content": "Mujibur Rahuman, MP from the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, delivered a scathing critique of the political hypocrisy surrounding the Batalanda Commission report during Thursday's 10 parliamentary session. Rahuman highlighted the violent actions of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna JVP and their severe impact on politicians, police officers, and civilians, as documented in the Batalanda Commission's final report. Rahuman pointed out that the violent actions disrupted essential services and created a state of lawlessness, causing immense difficulties for the general public. He accused political opponents of stirring up the Batalanda issue for electoral gain, noting that for thirty-six years, there was no proposal to investigate the assassination of JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera. He criticized the JVP for forming a coalition government formed with Chandrika Kumaratunga and the subsequent good governance government led by Ranil Wickremesinghe, and for not addressing the Batalanda issue. Rahuman questioned the current attacks on Wickremesinghe, pointing out that many of his critics had previously collaborated with him. Rahuman also commented on the statements made by the JVP over the alleged involvement of Gotabaya Rajapaksa in an incident in Matale, and the distribution of reports at the Galle Face protest site in 2022. He called for accountability and questioned why no proposals were brought forward regarding these issues when the current government came to power. He further criticized the NPP's retired military organization and its leaders, who were involved in the suppression during the 80s and 90s, for now seeking positions in the government. Rahuman accused them of hypocrisy and warned against dragging the Batalanda issue into the current election. Rahuman emphasized that the historical wrongs committed by JVP political leaders cannot be erased, even if attempts are made to do so.",

        "content": "The Matara Magistrate's Court has ordered the release of Inspector General of Police Deshabandu Tennakoon on bail, requiring two sureties of 1 million rupees each. Tennakoon who was remanded until the 10th of April was escorted to the Magistrate's Court earlier in the day. A warrant was issued on February 28, 2025, in connection with a shooting incident near a hotel in Weligama on December 31, 2023, which resulted in the death of an officer from the Colombo Crime Division. The Matara Magistrate's Court had ordered the arrest of Tennakoon and eight others involved in the incident. Following the issuance of the warrant, Tennakoon was also subjected to an international travel ban. Despite this, he evaded arrest, prompting the police to launch a special operation to apprehend him. In a bid to avoid arrest, Tennakoon filed a writ petition with the Court of Appeal, seeking an interim order to prevent his detention. However, the Court of Appeal rejected his petition and instructed the police to arrest Tennakoon immediately and present him before the Matara Magistrate's Court. The Court of Appeal also ordered legal action against individuals who assisted Tennakoon in evading arrest. Thereafter, Tennakoon appeared before the Matara Magistrate's Court, and was remanded, and was released on bail on 10th April.",

        "content": "Attorney-at-Law Sunil Watagala, Deputy Minister of Public Security and Parliamentary Affairs, has made serious allegations against Sri Lanka's Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe, linking him to the abuse of power and involvement in torture chambers during his tenure as Minister of Industries and Scientific Affairs.In a detailed statement, Watagala recounted his involvement in the student movement during the period in question and highlighted the tragic fate of individuals such as Wijeyadasa Liyanarachchi, Charitha Lankapura, and Kanchan Abeypala, who suffered in the Batalanda Torture Chamber and other similar facilities.Watagala referred to the Batalanda Commission report, which introduced several recommendations and noted that Wickremesinghe had given directions to the police regarding anti-subversive activities. He said that the Commission held that Wickremesinghe had no legal authority to issue such directions and had abused his power. The report further stated that Wickremesinghe interfered with proper police duties and law enforcement.He went on to note that the Commission of Inquiry implicated Wickremesinghe and SSP Nalin Delgoda in the maintenance of unlawful detention and torture chambers at the Batalanda Housing Scheme. It was revealed that house number B2 belonged to Wickremesinghe and house number B8 to SP Douglas Peiris, both of whom stayed in these houses and conspired to commit the acts in question.Watagala said that the commission of inquiry noted that Wickremesinghe abused his authority by directing the release of these houses to police officers. Despite these facts, Wickremesinghe recently claimed on Al-Jazeera that the JVP incited fear based on the 1987 Indo-Lanka Accord and launched an attack on the Sapugaskanda Police Station. Watagala pointed out the contradiction in Wickremesinghe's statements, noting that he had previously acknowledged that the JVP and other parties did not commit acts of violence.The Commission of Inquiry also shed light on the disappearance of Wijeyadasa Liyanarachchi, with Ravi Jayawardena, son of former President J. R. Jayawardena, suggesting to the IGP that Liyanarachchi may have been arrested by the Tangalle Police. Watagala asserted that Wickremesinghe and Ravi Jayawardena were responsible for these deaths and must be held accountable.Watagala concluded by stating that Wickremesinghe's association with Gonawala Sunil and Douglas Peiris led to the assassination of his comrades and that Wickremesinghe should be directly held responsible for these crimes. He vowed to take legal action against the real perpetrators.",

There are no winners in a trade war, and going against the world will only lead to self-isolation, Xi told Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez in Beijing on Friday, according to state broadcaster CCTV. For over 70 years, China s development has relied on self-reliance and hard work never on handouts from others, and it is not afraid of any unjust suppression, Xi added. China and US have been engaged in a tit-for-tat tariff battle in recent weeks, but until now the Chinese leader had remained publicly silent. Xi has struck a defiant note in his first remarks, doubling down on messages of strength and resilience already broadcast by Chinese officials and state media. Regardless of how the external environment changes, China will remain confident, stay focused, and concentrate on managing its own affairs well, Xi was quoted as saying by CCTV. As the rest of the world received a 90-day reprieve from Trump s reciprocal tariffs this week, the president moved to escalate levies on Chinese imports to 145. In retaliation, Beijing announced curbs Thursday on the import of Hollywood movies, after having hiked its own tariffs on the US to 84 and restricted some American firms from doing business in China or importing Chinese dual-use goods. The unprecedented tariffs threaten to decimate trade between the world s two largest economies and further damage relations in other areas, with no obvious offramp in sight. Source: CNN",

In a statement, the IMF said that the staff team had very productive discussions with the Sri Lankan authorities on economic performance and policies underpinning the Fourth Review under the IMF Extended Fund Facility EFF arrangement. Following are the key points from the statement: 1. IMF: Recent external shocks and evolving developments are creating uncertainty for Sri Lanka's economy, still recovering from its own crisis. 2. IMF Mission Chief Evan Papageorgiou: More time needed to assess the impact of global shocks on Sri Lanka's IMF-supported program. 3. Sri Lanka's commitment to program objectives ensures policy continuity and strong implementation. Sustaining reform momentum is critical. 4. IMF: Sustained revenue mobilization and prudent budget execution are crucial to preserve limited fiscal space amid global uncertainty. 5. Boosting tax compliance and reinstating an efficient VAT refund mechanism will help revenue gains without new tax measures. 6. Avoiding new tax exemptions reduces fiscal revenue leakages and corruption risks, building needed fiscal buffers. 7. Restoring cost recovery in electricity pricing minimizes fiscal risks from state-owned enterprises. 8. IMF: Important to protect the poor and vulnerable with well-targeted, time-bound fiscal support. 9. Continued monitoring of inflation is necessary to ensure sustained price stability and macroeconomic stability. 10. IMF: Ongoing discussions with Sri Lankan authorities on economic performance and policies, underpinning the Fourth Review under the EFF arrangement. Full Statement: An International Monetary Fund IMF team led by Evan Papageorgiou visited Colombo from April 3 to 11, 2025. After constructive discussions in Colombo, Mr. Papageorgiou issued the following statement: Sri Lanka s ambitious reform agenda supported by the IMF Extended Fund Facility EFF continues to deliver commendable outcomes. The post-crisis growth rebound of 5 percent in 2024 is impressive. Inflation declined considerably in recent quarters and has fallen to 2.6 percent at end-March 2025. Gross official reserves increased to US 6.5 billion at end-March 2025 with sizeable foreign exchange purchases by the central bank. Substantial fiscal reforms have strengthened public finances. The recent external shock and evolving developments are creating uncertainty for the Sri Lankan economy, which is still recovering from its own economic crisis. More time is needed to assess the impact of the global shock and how its implications for Sri Lanka can be addressed within the contours of its IMF-supported program. The government s sustained commitment to program objectives is ensuring policy continuity and program implementation remains strong. Going forward, sustaining the reform momentum is critical to safeguard the hard-won gains of the program and put the economy on a path toward lasting macroeconomic stability and higher inclusive growth. Against increased global uncertainty, sustained revenue mobilization efforts and prudent budget execution in line with Budget 2025 are critical to preserve the limited fiscal space. Boosting tax compliance, including by reinstating an efficient and timely VAT refund mechanism, will help contribute to revenue gains without resorting to additional tax policy measures. Avoiding new tax exemptions will help reduce fiscal revenue leakages, corruption risks and build much needed fiscal buffers, including for social spending to support Sri Lanka s most vulnerable. Restoring cost recovery in electricity pricing will help minimize fiscal risks arising from the electricity state-owned enterprise. The government has an important responsibility to protect the poor and vulnerable at this uncertain time. It is important to redouble efforts to improve targeting, adequacy, and coverage of social safety nets. Fiscal support needs to be well-targeted, time-bound, and within the existing budget envelope. While inflation remains low, continued monitoring is warranted to ensure sustained price stability and support macroeconomic stability. Against ongoing global uncertainty, it remains important to continue rebuilding external buffers through reserves accumulation. Discussions are ongoing, and the authorities are encouraged to continue to make progress on restoring cost-recovery electricity pricing, strengthening the tax exemptions framework, and other important structural reforms. The IMF team held meetings with His Excellency President and Finance Minister Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Honorable Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya; Honorable Labor Minister and Deputy Minister of Economic Development Prof. Anil Jayantha Fernando, Honorable Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning Dr. Harshana Suriyapperuma, Central Bank of Sri Lanka Governor Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Secretary to the Treasury Mr. K M Mahinda Siriwardana, Senior Economic Advisor to the President Duminda Hulangamuwa, and other senior government and CBSL officials. The team also met with parliamentarians, representatives from the private sector, civil society organizations, and development partners. We would like to thank the authorities for the excellent collaboration during the mission. Discussions are continuing with the goal of reaching staff-level agreement in the near term to pave the way for the timely completion of the fourth review. We reaffirm our commitment to support Sri Lanka at this uncertain time.",

        "date": "12-04-2025 | 1:09 PM",
        "content": "Journalism has long stood as a cornerstone of democratic societies, serving as both a mirror and a watchdog. In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and pressing global challenges, the role of journalists becomes ever more pivotal. Organized by the prestigious Journalists Association of Korea, the World Journalists Conference 2025 WJC 2025, held from March 31 to April 4 across Seoul and other major cities in South Korea, brought together Journalists from over 50 countries to deliberate on the evolving landscape of journalism. A Word About The Journalists Association of Korea: A Pillar of Press FreedomEstablished on August 17, 1964, the Journalists Association of Korea JAK emerged as a unified response against the Press Ethics Commission Law, which sought to institutionalize governmental interference in the media. Over the decades, JAK has grown into South Korea s largest organization of professional journalists, boasting a membership exceeding 12,000 individuals from 209 media outlets spanning newspapers, broadcasting, telecommunications, and digital platforms. As it approaches its 61st anniversary, JAK continues to champion press freedom, uphold journalistic ethics, and foster international collaboration among media professionals. Conference 1: Shaping the Future of Journalism in the AI Media Era; Copyrights and Ethical ChallengesThe inaugural session of WJC 2025, held at the Korea Press Institute in Seoul, centered on the theme Shaping the Future of Journalism in the AI Media Era: Copyright and Ethical Challenges. Moderated by Lee Joo Hee, Managing Editor of The Korea Herald, the session featured insights from Yin Cao China Daily, China, Hwang Seok-ha Busan Daily News, Korea, Natalia Szewczak Business Insider Poland, Poland, and Diana Fuentes Investigative Reporters and Editors, USA. Yin Cao: The Role of AI in Journalism; Balancing Efficiency and Integrity in the AI Era Yin Cao highlighted the transformative impact of AI tools like ChatGPT and Deepseek in streamlining journalistic tasks such as drafting, content personalization, and multimedia generation. She emphasized the efficiency gains AI offers, including rapid transcription of interviews and headline suggestions. However, she cautioned against potential pitfalls: Misinformation: AI s capacity to generate content can inadvertently spread false information if not properly vetted. Copyright Infringement: The use of data scraped from the internet without appropriate permissions raises legal and ethical concerns. Privacy Violations: Instances of voice cloning without consent underscore the need for stringent privacy safeguards. Deepfakes and Fraud: The potential misuse of AI to deceive the public poses threats to trust and democratic processes.To mitigate these risks, Cao advocated for clear newsroom policies on AI usage, transparency regarding AI-generated content, robust regulations to protect creators rights, and ongoing education on AI governance. She concluded, Journalists who fail to adapt and critically engage with AI tools risk obsolescence. Embracing AI sensibly can enhance our craft and reaffirm our value. Hwang Seok-ha: Journalism in the AI Era; The Intersection of Efficiency, Ethics CopyrightDrawing from his experience covering baseball, Hwang Seok-ha discussed leveraging AI for data analysis in sports reporting. Confronted with complex player statistics predominantly in English abbreviations, he utilized ChatGPT to interpret and analyze the data. While acknowledging AI s utility in handling numerical data, Hwang warned against overreliance, citing instances where AI-generated content contained inaccuracies a phenomenon known as hallucination. He stressed the necessity of fact-checking AI outputs against verified sources to maintain journalistic integrity.Referencing Gannett s policies, Hwang emphasized the importance of transparency, accuracy, fairness, and accountability when incorporating AI into journalism. He asserted that journalists bear the ultimate responsibility for AI-assisted reporting and must promptly correct any errors to uphold credibility. He concluded, Without clear legal safeguards, there is a high risk of jeopardizing the sustainability of journalism. Therefore, it is crucial to establish institutional frameworks that ensure fair compensation when AI trains on and utilizes news articles.\" Diana Fuentes: The New Life of AI in the 21st CenturyDiana Fuentes highlighted AI s potential to enhance investigative journalism. She cited The New York Times use of AI to condense over 500 hours of election misinformation recordings into five hours of analyzable content, demonstrating AI s capacity to streamline data processing. Fuentes underscored the importance of transparency in AI usage, advocating for clear disclosures to maintain public trust. Trust and credibility are difficult to earn. Unfortunately, it is all too easy to lose, she said adding to it Knowledge is power. We should be willing to share that power. Diana also highlighted the role of organizations like Investigative Reporters and Editors IRE in training journalists on the ethical use of AI. She praised their efforts to balance innovation with responsibility: Humans need to be involved all along the way. She concluded with a call for unity and collaboration: We need to use all available tools and work together on behalf of our communities. Opening Ceremony:Following Conference 1, the official opening ceremony commenced with an address by JAK President Park Jong Hyun, who underscored the pressing issues of AI integration and climate change as challenges requiring collective action from the international press. Congratulatory speeches were later delivered by National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik Virtually and Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism Yu In Chon. An official luncheon organized by the JAK at the National Press Club provided 65 Journalists from 52 Countries with an opportunity to network and reflect on the discussions. Conference 2: The Role of Journalism in Confronting Climate ChangeResuming after the luncheon, Conference 2 focused on The Role of Journalism in Confronting Climate Change and Environmental Shifts. Moderated by Park Sang Wook of JTBC Korea, the panel featured Murray Webster CBC, Canada, Tsegahun Asefa Shimekit NBC Ethiopia TV, Gianmarco Volpe Agenzia Nova, Italy, and Yun Ji Ro Next Group, Korea. Murray Webster: Reframing Climate ReportingMurray Webster, a Senior Defence and Foreign Policy Correspondent representing CBC, Canada urged journalists to reframe climate change narratives by highlighting its implications for national security. Webster emphasized that climate change is a driver of geopolitics, citing its links to natural disasters, refugee flows, and conflicts over resources: Climate change is becoming a driver of geopolitics whether it is the melting of polar ice cap in the Arctic; raging wildfires in the North or more recently California; natural disasters; droughts and food insecurity that lead to mass migration. Webster further referenced the 2008 US National Security Assessment and 2015 White House Strategy, both of which warned of the security implications of climate change warnings that are now playing out globally.He added in his speech on NATO s and the EU s late but growing recognition of climate as a security threat and pointed to the Arctic s rising strategic importance.He concluded, We live in perilous times environmentally and now geopolitically. Climate change is spoken about in apocalyptic and existential terms. The apocalypse may be upon us. Although, it may not look entirely like what we have been predicting for the last 20 years. End of the Main Conference:Following the insightful panel discussions, both Conference 1 and Conference 2 at the World Journalists Conference 2025 WJC 2025 featured engaging Q A sessions. After Conference 2, attendees were treated to a special lecture by Pohang City Mayor, Lee Kang Deok. He detailed Pohang s ambitious Greenway Project, initiated in 2016, aimed at transforming the city from a steel industry hub into a sustainable, green urban center. The project encompasses Pohang s commitment to environmental sustainability. The conference concluded with a musical evening featuring South Korean baritone, Claudio Jung. The World Journalists Conference 2025 not only facilitated critical discussions on the evolving landscape of journalism and pressing global issues but also celebrated cultural diversity and sustainable initiatives. While the main conference of the World Journalists Conference 2025 WJC 2025 concluded in Seoul, the event s agenda extended beyond the capital, offering participants immersive experiences across South Korea. Participants had the opportunity of visiting several major cities, including Jeju Island, Suwon, Anseong, Songdo, and Incheon, each providing unique insights into the nation s cultural heritage and advancements.",

Under no circumstances should you drive under the influence of alcohol. Not driving under the influence is your responsibility as a driver, and rejecting drunk driving is everyone's responsibility.We urge you not to drive at excessive speeds.

        "date": "14-04-2025 | 11:20 AM",
        "content": "CNN New satellite images show what could be North Korea s biggest warship ever possibly more than double the size of anything in leader Kim Jong Un s naval fleet. Images taken by independent satellite providers Maxar Technologies and Planet Labs on April 6 show the ship under construction in the water at the Nampo shipyard on North Korea s west coast, about 60 kilometers 37 miles southwest of the capital Pyongyang. Analysts say the pictures show ongoing construction of weapons and other internal systems of the ship, which is likely a guided-missile frigate FFG designed to carry missiles in vertical launch tubes for use against targets on land and sea. The FFG is approximately 140 meters 459 feet long, making it the largest warship manufactured in North Korea, an analysis by Joseph Bermudez Jr. and Jennifer Jun at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said. For comparison, the US Navy s Arleigh Burke-class destroyers are about 505 feet long and its under-construction Constellation-class frigates will be 496 feet long. The existence of the warship is not a surprise. The Kim regime has been engaged in a rapid modernization of its armed forces, developing a range of new weapons and testing intercontinental ballistic missiles that can reach almost anywhere in the United States. Kim Duk-ki, a retired South Korean admiral, said he thinks Moscow may be providing the technology for the frigate s missile systems. Pictures of the vessel appeared in a report by state-run Korean Central Television released late last year on the ruling Workers Party s end-of-year plenary session. The images showed leader Kim inspecting the ship s construction. The images shown in the KCTV video show the warship could have the kind of weaponry possessed by modern navies, including vertical launch cells that could be used to fire a variety of missiles. Analysts also noted the ship seems to be set up to have phased-array radar, which can track threats and targets more quickly and accurately than previously displayed North Korean capabilities. Despite those indications of advanced warfighting abilities, analysts urged caution in making assumptions.",

        "content": "COLOMBO News 1st The Erythrina tree, locally known as 'Erabudu', adds a unique charm to the New Year celebrations.Traditionally, two types of Erythrina trees have adorned Sri Lanka's historic villages during the New Year: the Erythrina variegata and the Erythrina fusca, known locally as the Erabudu and Yak Erythrina, respectively.These trees, scientifically named Erythrina variegata and Erythrina fusca, were once widespread in the country.Typically, the leaves of these trees begin to fall as they start to bloom in April. The sight of these trees covered in beautiful red flowers is truly enchanting. However, this stunning view has become increasingly rare in recent times due to the gradual decline of the Erythrina tree population.\"When we investigated the cause, we found that in 2006, a species of insect known as the Erythrina Gall Wasp was reported in Sri Lanka. The damage caused by this insect is believed to be responsible for the decline of these trees. Additionally, unlike in the past, Erythrina trees are no longer planted as fences. Nowadays, walls are built instead of fences, and as a result, these trees are gradually disappearing from our surroundings,\" exaplained Professor Cyril Wijesundara, a Botanist. The Erythrina tree is not only aesthetically pleasing but also holds medicinal value.\"This tree is important for its beauty and cultural significance, as well as its medicinal properties. In traditional Sri Lankan medicine, Erythrina leaves, bark, and seeds are used. They are used for various ailments, including skin conditions and as an anti-cancer treatment. The tree also provides shade in tea plantations. It is a very important tree found in tropical countries,\" he noted.Given the significance of the Erythrina tree, it is crucial to scientifically confirm the relationship between its decline and the Erythrina Gall Wasp, or other potential factors. This responsibility falls on our country's researchers.Furthermore, based on scientific research, it is the duty of the authorities to take appropriate measures to conserve this tree. If not, the Erythrina tree, which doubles the beauty of the New Year season, will become nothing more than a memory of the past.",

This behavior, known as an alert circle, is a natural response to perceived threats, as elephants can sense vibrations through their feet. The herd's quick action to safeguard their young was captured on video, displaying their strong familial bonds and protective instincts. After several minutes, the elephants appeared to calm down, reassured that the danger had passed. Fortunately, officials reported no injuries or major damage from the earthquake.",

        "date": "15-04-2025 | 2:10 PM",
        "content": "Singapore will head to the polls on 3 May, in what will be the first electoral test for its new prime minister Lawrence Wong. The election campaign, which lasts just nine days, is expected to be dominated by the rising cost of living, housing needs, jobs, and a growing demand for healthcare amid an ageing population. Voters are widely expected to return the ruling People's Action Party PAP to power. The PAP has won every election since Singapore was granted self rule by the British in 1959. The country's last election in 2020 saw the opposition Workers' Party secure 10 seats - the biggest victory for the opposition since Singapore gained independence in 1965. This time, ninety-seven seats are up for grabs. Though the PAP won 83 out of 93 seats in 2020, it will no doubt be looking for a stronger win this year - with the last election seen as a setback for the party. According to a Reuters report citing data from pollster YouGov, 44 of 1,845 Singaporeans surveyed in March have decided who to vote for. Of that number, 63 say they would choose the ruling party and 15 would back the leading opposition Workers' Party. The election is being seen as the first real test of Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who took office last year - replacing the city state's long-serving premier Lee Hsien Loong, who served as leader for 20 years. Presenting his first budget as the country's leader in February, Wong unveiled a series of tax rebates, handouts and sector-specific measures to cushion against cost-of-living pressures - in what some analysts call a \"feel good\" budget aimed at sweetening the ground before the election. Since becoming an independent nation in 1965, Singapore has only had four prime ministers - all from the ruling People's Action Party PAP. The first was Mr Lee's father, Lee Kuan Yew, who is widely considered as the founder of modern Singapore and led the country for 25 years. Singapore's political landscape has been dominated by the PAP, though the party was rocked by a series of scandals in 2020 - including a senior minister's arrest in a corruption probe as well as the resignation of two lawmakers over an extramarital affair. Voting is compulsory for Singapore's 2.75 million eligible citizens. Singapore mirrors the UK's first-past-the-post voting system, but there are key differences that make it harder for opposition parties. MPs contest for constituencies that vary in size and the larger ones are not represented by an individual MP, but by a team of up to five MPs - called Group Representative Constituencies GRCs. The system was introduced in 1988 as a way to include more representation from Singapore's minority groups in the predominantly Chinese city - so parties could \"risk\" running one or two minority candidates. But until several years ago, opposition parties have not had the resources to recruit enough skilled and experienced people to genuinely contest these larger constituencies. Candidates must also deposit S 13,500 9,700: 7,700 to contest and need to win more than one-eighth of total votes to get it back. The electoral divisions of constituencies are also often changed to reflect population growth - opposition parties say this is not done transparently and amounts to gerrymandering, something the government has always denied.

Yoon declared martial law in December, sending armed soldiers to parliament before reversing course. He was quickly impeached by lawmakers, but resisted arrest for weeks in a criminal probe. After a lengthy standoff, in which his security detail played a key role, he became South Korea's first sitting head of state to be arrested in January. He was later released on procedural grounds. Police said on Wednesday they had \"initiated the execution of a search and seizure warrant at the presidential office and the presidential residence complex\". Police seized encrypted phone servers and raided the office of Yoon's presidential security detail, plus his chief of security's house, in what they said was part of a probe into \"alleged obstruction of an arrest warrant execution\". Yoon spent weeks holed up in his compound in January, protected by members of the Presidential Security Service who had remained loyal to him. His guards had installed barbed wire and barricades at the residence, forcing hundreds of police officers and investigators to use ladders and scale perimeter walls to reach the main building. At the time, he was booked on charges of obstruction, with police saying this week that \"in principle\" an investigation would be necessary. Police also seized CCTV footage from the presidential office, as part of a separate probe into former interior minister Lee Sang-min, they said. Yoon was in court Monday for the first official day of his criminal trial on insurrection charges. Yoon denied that he committed insurrection. His next hearing is scheduled for April 21, with experts saying the trial is likely to go on for months. Source: CNA",

        "content": "Sri Lanka's President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has declared an end to the divisive politics that once characterized elections in the country. He emphasized that the recent General Election marked a significant shift, with people from the North, East, and South Tamil, Muslim, and Sinhala alike uniting in support of the National People's Power. This election, he noted, brought the nation together. President Dissanayake urged for political engagement that fosters unity rather than division. He highlighted the need for a harmonious country where all citizens can live together peacefully. Reflecting on the nation's history of racism and discrimination, he vowed never to allow such divisions to rise again. The new government, he assured, is committed to protecting national unity, ensuring there will no longer be a majority and minority in the country. Instead, all citizens, regardless of ethnicity or region, will be recognized as Sri Lankans. Addressing the aftermath of the war, President Dissanayake acknowledged the state takeover of lands in the north, the closure of roads, and the gazetting of personal lands under the Department of Forest Conservation. He promised that the National People's Power government will resolve these issues, enabling people to live and cultivate on their own lands. In the context of the country's development drive, President Dissanayake identified Mannar as a key area due to its rich marine resources and dependence on the fisheries industry. He expressed concern over illegal fishing activities in Pesalai and assured that the issue was discussed with the Indian Prime Minister. The Sri Lanka Navy has been instructed to crack down on all illegal activities in the sea area, fulfilling its duty to protect national waters. President Dissanayake also mentioned the ferry service between Mannar and Rameswaram, stating that discussions are underway with the Indian government to resume this service. He highlighted Mannar's potential for wind power generation and noted that past approvals for such projects often overlooked environmental concerns. The government has temporarily suspended these projects and is committed to utilizing this resource responsibly, taking into account the concerns of the people and minimizing environmental destruction.",

He emphasized that this is not a genuine reckoning with globalization's imperfections but a retreat into protectionism.Quoting a Chinese proverb, which means \"There is nothing difficult in the world, only those who lack the will,\" Ibrahim underscored China's role as a rational, strong, and reliable partner amid global turbulence. He affirmed Malaysia's unwavering and principled friendship with China, guided by historical wisdom and future promise.Malaysia's foreign policy, according to Ibrahim, is driven by a clear-eyed vision of its interests, favoring cooperation over confrontation, respect over rivalry, and dialogue as a cornerstone of lasting peace and prosperity.",

        "date": "17-04-2025 | 11:48 AM",
        "content": "Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong says the escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, will have a profound impact on global business and economic stability. Despite the US postponing most of its \"reciprocal\" tariffs, the current baseline tariff rates remain significantly higher than before, creating substantial uncertainty for businesses worldwide. Companies are unable to plan long-term investments due to the unpredictable nature of tariff changes, he said.Prime Minister Wong pointed out that the US and China are now engaged in a full-blown trade war, with US tariffs on Chinese goods reaching 145 and China's retaliatory tariffs on US goods at 125.He emphasized that Singapore's prosperity has historically depended on a stable, rules-based global order and the free flow of trade, capital, people, and ideas. As this old order frays, a new, more multipolar, less coordinated, and more contested global system is likely to emerge. This new order will be shaped by the actions and choices of many different players rather than the grand designs of a single superpower or a harmonious concord of major powers.Despite Singapore's limitations as a small state, Prime Minister Wong stressed the importance of responding with agility and resolve, actively shaping the nation's destiny. He noted that Singapore is better resourced, more capable, and more connected than it was in 1965, with strong global friendships and a well-regarded international brand. Singapore enjoys a deep reservoir of international goodwill and is not alone in its commitment to an open, stable, and rules-based global system.Prime Minister Wong called for deepening and expanding networks with like-minded countries to preserve multilateral frameworks and lay the groundwork for a more stable global order in the years ahead.",

She highlighted the efforts of policymakers to strengthen their economies, improve regional ties, and address surpluses and deficits, expressing strong support for these initiatives.Georgieva identified the most pressing priority as ensuring cooperation in a multi-polar world. She stressed the need for trade policies that secure settlements among major players, preserve openness, and create a more level playing field. This includes restarting the global trend toward lower tariff rates and reducing non-tariff barriers and distortions.She underscored the necessity of a more resilient world economy, advocating against division and emphasizing policies that allow private economic agents time to adjust. Georgieva highlighted the importance of distributional policies as a bridge between good economics and good politics, ensuring that those adversely affected by economic changes are cushioned.Looking ahead to the IMF Spring Meetings, Georgieva expressed optimism that the gathering of 191 member countries would provide a vital forum for dialogue at a crucial time. She called on all countries, regardless of size, to contribute to strengthening the global economy in an era of frequent and severe shocks.Georgieva concluded her address by noting that challenges present opportunities. She encouraged a focus on building a new, better-balanced, and more resilient world economy, rather than preserving the old.

We assume that the Ukrainian side will follow our example. At the same time, our troops must be ready to repel possible violations of the truce and provocations from the enemy, any of its aggressive actions, Putin said at a meeting with Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, in a video shared by the Kremlin s Press Service.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the ceasefire another attempt by Putin to play with human lives. He wrote on X that air raid alerts are spreading across Ukraine, and Shahed drones in our skies reveal Putin s true attitude toward Easter and toward human life. Largest POW exchange so far The two sides meanwhile exchanged hundreds of POWs on Saturday. Russia s Ministry of Defense said that 246 Russian service members were returned from territory controlled by Kyiv, and that as a gesture of goodwill 31 wounded Ukrainian POWs were transferred in exchange for 15 wounded Russian soldiers in need of urgent medical care.Zelenskyy said that 277 Ukrainian warriors have returned home from Russian captivity.Both sides thanked the United Arab Emirates for their mediation.Putin s ceasefire announcement came after U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are coming to a head and insisted that neither side is playing him in his push to end the grinding three-year war.Trump spoke shortly after Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that the U.S. may move on from trying to secure a Russia-Ukraine peace deal if there is no progress in the coming days, after months of efforts have failed to bring an end to the fighting.",

        "date": "19-04-2025 | 2:59 PM",
        "content": "The US Department of State, under the direction of Secretary Marco Rubio, has initiated a comprehensive review of social media accounts for foreign applicants who have visited the Gaza Strip since January 1, 2007. This review applies to all types of US visas, immigrant and non-immigrant, including those for students and tourists, and covers individuals who have spent time in Gaza in an official or diplomatic capacity. Employees and volunteers of non-governmental organisations will also be subject to this screening process.The primary objective of this review is to identify potential security risks, and if any derogatory information related to security issues is uncovered, the applicant's visa submission will be referred for an interagency investigation to assess whether the applicant poses a national security risk.Rubio previously reported that his office had revoked over 300 visas since the beginning of the year, including those of student visa holders who have expressed criticism towards Israel's actions in Gaza.According to foreign media, this move has raised concerns, as the US Constitution protects freedom of speech for individuals within the US, regardless of their visa status.",
